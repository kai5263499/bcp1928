| **Psalm 56. Miserere mei, Deus.**\                                    |
| BE merciful unto me, O God, for man goeth about to devour me; \* he   |
| is daily fighting, and troubling me.\                                 |
| 2 Mine enemies are daily at hand to swallow me up; \* for they be     |
| many that fight against me, O thou Most Highest.\                     |
| 3 Nevertheless, though I am sometime afraid, \* yet put I my trust in |
| thee.\                                                                |
| 4 I will praise God, because of his word: \* I have put my trust in   |
| God, and will not fear what flesh can do unto me.\                    |
| 5 They daily mistake my words; \* all that they imagine is to do me   |
| evil.\                                                                |
| 6 They hold all together, and keep themselves close, \* and mark my   |
| steps, when they lay wait for my soul.\                               |
| 7 Shall they escape for their wickedness? \* thou, O God, in thy      |
| displeasure shalt cast them down.\                                    |
| 8 Thou tellest my wanderings; put my tears into thy bottle: \* are    |
| not these things noted in thy book?\                                  |
| 9 Whensoever I call upon thee, then shall mine enemies be put to      |
| flight: \* this I know; for God is on my side.\                       |
| 10 In God\'s word will I rejoice; \* in the LORD\'S word will I       |
| comfort me.\                                                          |
| 11 Yea, in God have I put my trust; \* I will not be afraid what man  |
| can do unto me.\                                                      |
| 12 Unto thee, O God, will I pay my vows; \* unto thee will I give     |
| thanks.\                                                              |
| 13 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, and my feet from       |
| falling, \* that I may walk before God in the light of the living.\   |
| \                                                                     |
| **\                                                                   |
| Psalm 57. Miserere mei, Deus.**\                                      |
| BE merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me; for my soul trusteth |
| in thee; \* and under the shadow of thy wings shall be my refuge,     |
| until this tyranny be overpast.\                                      |
| 2 I will call unto the Most High God, \* even unto the God that shall |
| perform the cause which I have in hand.\                              |
| 3 He shall send from heaven, \* and save me from the reproof of him   |
| that would eat me up.\                                                |
| 4 God shall send forth his mercy and truth: \* my soul is among       |
| lions;\                                                               |
| 5 And I lie even among the children of men, that are set on fire, \*  |
| whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.\   |
| 6 Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens; \* and thy glory above    |
| all the earth.\                                                       |
| 7 They have laid a net for my feet, and pressed down my soul; \* they |
| have digged a pit before me, and are fallen into the midst of it      |
| themselves.\                                                          |
| 8 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed; \* I will sing and     |
| give praise.\                                                         |
| 9 Awake up, my glory; awake, lute and harp: \* I myself will awake    |
| right early.\                                                         |
| 10 I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the peoples; \* and I  |
| will sing unto thee among the nations.\                               |
| 11 For the greatness of thy mercy reacheth unto the heavens, \* and   |
| thy truth unto the clouds.\                                           |
| 12 Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens; \* and thy glory above   |
| all the earth.\                                                       |
| \                                                                     |
| **\                                                                   |
| Psalm 58. Si vere utique.**\                                          |
| ARE your minds set upon righteousness, O ye congregation? \* and do   |
| ye judge the thing that is right, O ye sons of men?\                  |
| 2 Yea, ye imagine mischief in your heart upon the earth, \* and your  |
| hands deal with wickedness.\                                          |
| 3 The ungodly are froward, even from their mother\'s womb; \* as soon |
| as they are born, they go astray, and speak lies.\                    |
| 4 They are as venomous as the poison of a serpent, \* even like the   |
| deaf adder, that stoppeth her ears;\                                  |
| 5 Which refuseth to hear the voice of the charmer, \* charm he never  |
| so wisely.\                                                           |
| 6 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouths; \* smite the jaw-bones   |
| of the lions, O LORD.\                                                |
| 7 Let them fall away like water that runneth apace; \* when they      |
| shoot their arrows, let them be rooted out.\                          |
| 8 Let them consume away like a snail, and be like the untimely fruit  |
| of a woman; \* and let them not see the sun.\                         |
| 9 Or ever your pots be made hot with thorns, \* he shall take them    |
| away with a whirlwind, the green and the burning alike.\              |
| 10 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance; \* he     |
| shall wash his footsteps in the blood of the ungodly.\                |
| 11 So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the          |
| righteous; \* doubtless there is a God that judgeth the earth.\       |
|                                                                       |

|                                                                       |
| **Psalm 59. Eripe me de inimicis.**\                                  |
| DELIVER me from mine enemies, O God; \* defend me from them that rise |
| up against me.\                                                       |
| 2 O deliver me from the wicked doers, \* and save me from the         |
| blood-thirsty men.\                                                   |
| 3 For lo, they lie waiting for my soul; \* the mighty men are         |
| gathered against me, without any offence or fault of me, O LORD.\     |
| 4 They run and prepare themselves without my fault; \* arise thou     |
| therefore to help me, and behold.\                                    |
| 5 Stand up, O LORD God of hosts, thou God of Israel, to visit all the |
| heathen, \* and be not merciful unto them that offend of malicious    |
| wickedness.\                                                          |
| 6 They go to and fro in the evening, \* they grin like a dog, and run |
| about through the city.\                                              |
| 7 Behold, they speak with their mouth, and swords are in their lips;  |
| \* for who doth hear?\                                                |
| 8 But thou, O LORD, shalt have them in derision, \* and thou shalt    |
| laugh all the heathen to scorn.\                                      |
| 9 My strength will I ascribe unto thee; \* for thou art the God of my |
| refuge.\                                                              |
| 10 God showeth me his goodness plenteously; \* and God shall let me   |
| see my desire upon mine enemies.\                                     |
| 11 Slay them not, lest my people forget it; \* but scatter them       |
| abroad among the people, and put them down, O Lord our defence.\      |
| 12 For the sin of their mouth, and for the words of their lips, they  |
| shall be taken in their pride: \* and why? their talk is of cursing   |
| and lies.\                                                            |
| 13 Consume them in thy wrath, consume them, that they may perish; \*  |
| and know that it is God that ruleth in Jacob, and unto the ends of    |
| the world.\                                                           |
| 14 And in the evening they will return, \* grin like a dog, and will  |
| go about the city.\                                                   |
| 15 They will run here and there for meat, \* and grudge if they be    |
| not satisfied.\                                                       |
| 16 As for me, I will sing of thy power, and will praise thy mercy     |
| betimes in the morning; \* for thou hast been my defence and refuge   |
| in the day of my trouble.\                                            |
| 17 Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing; \* for thou, O God, art my  |
| refuge, and my merciful God.\                                         |
| \                                                                     |
| **\                                                                   |
| Psalm 60. Deus, repulisti nos.**\                                     |
| O GOD, thou hast cast us out, and scattered us abroad; \* thou hast   |
| also been displeased: O turn thee unto us again.\                     |
| 2 Thou hast moved the land, and divided it: \* heal the sores         |
| thereof, for it shaketh.\                                             |
| 3 Thou hast showed thy people heavy things; \* thou hast given us a   |
| drink of deadly wine.\                                                |
| 4 Thou hast given a token for such as fear thee, \* that they may     |
| triumph because of the truth.\                                        |
| 5 Therefore were thy beloved delivered; \* help me with thy right     |
| hand, and hear me.\                                                   |
| 6 God hath spoken in his holiness, I will rejoice, and divide         |
| Shechem, \* and mete out the valley of Succoth.\                      |
| 7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; \* Ephraim also is the        |
| strength of my head; Judah is my law-giver;\                          |
| 8 Moab is my wash-pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; \*          |
| Philistia, be thou glad of me.\                                       |
| 9 Who will lead me into the strong city? \* who will bring me into    |
| Edom?\                                                                |
| 10 Hast not thou cast us out, O God? \* wilt not thou, O God, go out  |
| with our hosts?\                                                      |
| 11 O be thou our help in trouble; \* for vain is the help of man.\    |
| 12 Through God will we do great acts; \* for it is he that shall      |
| tread down our enemies.\                                              |
| \                                                                     |

| Psalm 61. Exaudi, Deus.**\                                            |
| HEAR my crying, O God, \* give ear unto my prayer.\                   |
| 2 From the ends of the earth will I call upon thee, \* when my heart  |
| is in heaviness.\                                                     |
| 3 O set me up upon the rock that is higher than I; \* for thou hast   |
| been my hope, and a strong tower for me against the enemy.\           |
| 4 I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever, \* and my trust shall be   |
| under the covering of thy wings.\                                     |
| 5 For thou, O Lord, hast heard my desires, \* and hast given an       |
| heritage unto those that fear thy Name.\                              |
| 6 Thou shalt grant the King a long life, \* that his years may endure |
| throughout all generations.\                                          |
| 7 He shall dwell before God for ever: \* O prepare thy loving mercy   |
| and faithfulness, that they may preserve him.\                        |
| 8 So will I alway sing praise unto thy Name, \* that I may daily      |
| perform my vows.                                                      |
