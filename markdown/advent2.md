| garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no   |

| 26 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a  |
| city of Galilee, named Nazareth,\                                     |
| 27 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house  |
| of David; and the virgin\'s name was Mary.\                           |
| 28 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art      |
| highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among        |
| women.\                                                               |
| 29 And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in  |
| her mind what manner of salutation this should be.\                   |
| 30 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found   |
| favour with God.\                                                     |
| 31 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a    |
| son, and shalt call his name JESUS.\                                  |
| 32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and |
| the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:\     |
| 33 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his    |
| kingdom there shall be no end.\                                       |
| 34 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know    |
| not a man?\                                                           |
| 35 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall     |
| come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee:   |
| therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be   |
| called the Son of God.\                                               |

| in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called  |
| barren.\                                                              |
| []{#anchor44837}37 For with God nothing shall be impossible.\         |
| 38 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me      |
| according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.\              |
| 39 And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with  |
| haste, into a city of Juda;\                                          |
| 40 And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.\   |
| 41 And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of  |
| Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the  |
| Holy Ghost:\                                                          |
| 42 And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou    |
| among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.\                   |
| 43 And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come   |

| 44 For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine    |
| ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.\                            |
| 45 And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance |
| of those things which were told her from the Lord.\                   |
| 46 And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,\                     |
| 47 And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.\                    |
| 48 For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for,        |
| behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.\       |
| 49 For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is    |
| his name.\                                                            |

| generation.\                                                          |
| 51 He hath showed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud  |
| in the imagination of their hearts.\                                  |
| 52 He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of  |
| low degree.\                                                          |

| 54 He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;\   |

| 1 Thessalonians 2:1-13**\                                             |
| 1 For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it    |
| was not in vain:\                                                     |
| 2 But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully     |
| entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak  |
| unto you the gospel of God with much contention.\                     |
| 3 For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in   |
| guile:\                                                               |
| []{#anchor64290}4 But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust    |
| with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God,      |
| which trieth our hearts.\                                             |
| []{#anchor65275}5 For neither at any time used we flattering words,   |
| as ye know, nor a cloak of covetousness; God is witness:\             |
| 6 Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when |
| we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.\            |
| 7 But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her        |
| children:\                                                            |
| 8 So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have    |
| imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own       |
| souls, because ye were dear unto us.\                                 |
| 9 For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring    |
| night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we |
| preached unto you the gospel of God.\                                 |
| 10 Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and          |
| unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:\             |
| 11 As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of  |
| you, as a father doth his children,\                                  |
| 12 That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his     |
| kingdom and glory.\                                                   |
| 13 For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye |
| received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as  |
| the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which        |
| effectually worketh also in you that believe.\                        |

| 1 Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose       |
| glorious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of the fat  |
| valleys of them that are overcome with wine!\                         |
| 2 Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, which as a tempest   |
| of hail and a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters           |
| overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand.\             |
| 3 The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden      |

| 4 And the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley,    |
| shall be a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit before the summer;   |
| which when he that looketh upon it seeth, while it is yet in his hand |
| he eateth it up.\                                                     |
| 5 In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory, and    |
| for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people,\              |
| 6 And for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and   |
| for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.\               |
| []{#anchor238287}7 But they also have erred through wine, and through |
| strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have      |

| out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble |

| what comparison shall we compare it?\                                 |

| 32 But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all  |

| 36 And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as   |
| he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.\ |
| 37 And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the |
| ship, so that it was now full.\                                       |

| []{#anchor263845}15 Because ye have said, We have made a covenant     |

| scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have    |
| made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:\     |
| 16 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a     |
| foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure    |
| foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.\                  |

| plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the    |
| waters shall overflow the hiding place.\                              |
| 18 And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your        |

| shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.\             |
| 19 From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for morning   |
