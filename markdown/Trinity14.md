| what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal;    |
| that ye may know the righteousness of the LORD.\                      |

| 23 And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days,  |
| was as if a man had inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the     |
| counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.\              |
| 1 Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve |
| thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:\    |
| 2 And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed, and     |
| will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall      |
| flee; and I will smite the king only:\                                |
| 3 And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou   |
| seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace.\  |
| 4 And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.\ |
| 5 Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us     |
| hear likewise what he saith.\                                         |
| 6 And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him,        |
| saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after   |
| his saying? if not; speak thou.\                                      |
| 7 And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath      |
| given is not good at this time.\                                      |
| []{#anchor85039}8 For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his   |
| men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a |
| bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of    |
| war, and will not lodge with the people.\                             |
| 9 Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it   |
| will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that |
| whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people  |
| that follow Absalom.\                                                 |
| 10 And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a      |
| lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a |
| mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men.\              |
| 11 Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto     |
| thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that is by the sea for |
| multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.\           |
| 12 So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found,   |
| and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of   |
| him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so   |
| much as one.\                                                         |
| 13 Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring |
| ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there   |
| be not one small stone found there.\                                  |
| 14 And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai  |
| the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD    |
| had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent |
| that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.\                         |

| thus and thus have I counselled.\                                     |

| night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest   |
| the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.\      |
| 17 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by En-rogel; for they might not be |
| seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they  |
| went and told king David.\                                            |

| had a well in his court; whither they went down.\                     |
| 19 And the woman took and spread a covering over the well\'s mouth,   |
| and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.\         |
| 20 And when Absalom\'s servants came to the woman to the house, they  |
| said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them,    |
| They be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and    |
| could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.\                     |
| 21 And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up   |
| out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David,   |
| Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel      |

| that was not gone over Jordan.\                                       |

| 1 And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains  |
| of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.\                     |
| 2 And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of   |
| Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah,  |
| Joab\'s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the         |
| Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth    |
| with you myself also.\                                                |
| 3 But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee    |
| away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they |
| care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now |
| it is better that thou succour us out of the city.\                   |
| 4 And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And   |
| the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by       |
| hundreds and by thousands.\                                           |
| 5 And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal     |
| gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the |
| people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning    |
| Absalom.\                                                             |
| 6 So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the       |
| battle was in the wood of Ephraim;\                                   |
| 7 Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, |
| and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand     |
| men.\                                                                 |
| 8 For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the         |
| country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword    |
| devoured.\                                                            |
| 9 And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a      |
| mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and    |
| his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the      |
| heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.\     |
| []{#anchor386774}10 And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and      |
| said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.\                        |
| 11 And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest |
| him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I      |
| would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.\           |
| 12 And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand     |
| shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand   |
| against the king\'s son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and |
| Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man       |
| Absalom.\                                                             |
| 13 Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life:   |
| for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest   |
| have set thyself against me.\                                         |
| 14 Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three  |
| darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom,      |
| while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.\                      |
| 15 And ten young men that bare Joab\'s armour compassed about and     |
| smote Absalom, and slew him.\                                         |
| 16 And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing   |
| after Israel: for Joab held back the people.\                         |
| 17 And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood,  |

| 3 I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye    |
| are in our hearts to die and live with you.\                          |
| 4 Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of  |
| you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our       |
| tribulation.\                                                         |
| 5 For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but   |
| we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were   |
| fears.\                                                               |
| 6 Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down,         |
| comforted us by the coming of Titus;\                                 |
| 7 And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was |
| comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, |
| your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.\            |
| 8 For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though  |
| I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you      |
| sorry, though it were but for a season.\                              |
| []{#anchor393792}9 Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but    |
| that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly  |
| manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.\               |
| []{#anchor392524}10 For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation  |
| not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.\    |
| 11 For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly     |
| sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of       |
| yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement |
| desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have      |
| approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.\                      |
| 12 Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause     |
| that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but   |
| that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.\     |
| 13 Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly  |
| the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was        |
| refreshed by you all.\                                                |
| 14 For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed;   |
| but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting,     |
| which I made before Titus, is found a truth.\                         |
| 15 And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he    |
| remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye  |
| received him.\                                                        |

| 1 Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed   |
| on the churches of Macedonia;\                                        |
| 2 How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy  |
| and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.\ |
| 3 For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they |
| were willing of themselves;\                                          |
| 4 Praying us with much entreaty that we would receive the gift, and   |
| take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.\        |
| 5 And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves |
| to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.\                         |
| 6 Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would   |
| also finish in you the same grace also.\                              |
| 7 Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance,    |
| and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that |
| ye abound in this grace also.\                                        |
| []{#anchor420348}8 I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the |
| forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.\      |
| 9 For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was |
| rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty  |
| might be rich.\                                                       |
| 10 And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who    |
| have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year      |
| ago.\                                                                 |
| 11 Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a         |
| readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that     |
| which ye have.\                                                       |
| 12 For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to  |
| that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.\              |
| 13 For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:\          |
| 14 But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a  |
| supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for  |
| your want: that there may be equality:\                               |
| 15 As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and  |
| he that had gathered little had no lack.\                             |

| hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy    |

| 7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for  |

| 13 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For     |
| thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.\  |
| 14 For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will  |
| also forgive you:\                                                    |

| Father forgive your trespasses.\                                      |
| 16 Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad         |
| countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear     |
| unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.\     |

| face;\                                                                |

| 11 And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying,  |
| Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring  |
| the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come   |
| to the king, even to his house.\                                      |

| and all thy servants.\                                                |

| Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.\     |
| 16 And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim,     |

| household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera |
| fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;\               |
| 19 And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me,   |
| neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the    |
| day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should |
| take it to his heart.\                                                |

| hath provoked very many.\                                             |
