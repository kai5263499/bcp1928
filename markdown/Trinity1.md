| and that he was come from God, and went to God;\                      |

| child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel     |
| before he was conceived in the womb.\                                 |
| 22 And when the days of her purification according to the law of      |
| Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present    |
| him to the Lord;\                                                     |
| 23 (As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth  |
| the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)\                          |
| 24 And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the    |
| law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.\        |
| 25 And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon;  |
| and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of  |
| Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.\                             |
| 26 And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not |
| see death, before he had seen the Lord\'s Christ.\                    |

| thy word:\                                                            |

| Israel.\                                                              |

| spoken of him.\                                                       |

| this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel;    |
| and for a sign which shall be spoken against;\                        |
| 35 (Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the    |
| thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.\                             |
| 36 And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of  |
| the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an      |
| husband seven years from her virginity;\                              |
| 37 And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which       |
| departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and        |
| prayers night and day.\                                               |
| 38 And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, |
| and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in            |
| Jerusalem.\                                                           |
| 39 And when they had performed all things according to the law of the |
| Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.\        |

| 1 Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of     |
| Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in    |
| the name of the God of Israel, even unto them.\                       |

| and with them were the prophets of God helping them.\                 |
| 6 The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the       |
| river, and Shethar-boznai, and his companions the Apharsachites,      |
| which were on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king:\        |
| 7 They sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto Darius  |
| the king, all peace.\                                                 |
| 8 Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea, |
| to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones,    |
| and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth fast on, and     |
| prospereth in their hands.\                                           |

| 10 We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write    |
| the names of the men that were the chief of them.\                    |
| 11 And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of   |

| wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of       |
| Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the      |
| people away into Babylon.\                                            |
| 13 But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king   |
| Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.\                      |
| 14 And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which |
| Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and      |
| brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king     |
| take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one,  |
| whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;\               |
| 15 And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the     |

| house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until    |
| now hath it been in building, and yet it is not finished.\            |
| 17 Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search    |

| Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,\                            |

| much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:\                   |
| 14 And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that |

| mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.\       |

| Master, what shall we do?\                                            |

| we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse   |
| any falsely; and be content with your wages.\                         |
| 15 And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their  |
| hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not;\                  |
| 16 John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with     |
| water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I   |
| am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost    |
| and with fire:\                                                       |

| with fire unquenchable.\                                              |

| 38 And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had    |
| heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him  |
| that he would not delay to come to them.\                             |
| 39 Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they        |

| weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while  |
| she was with them.\                                                   |

| turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her      |
| eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.\                            |
| 41 And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had       |
| called the saints and widows, presented her alive.\                   |

| made ready, he fell into a trance,\                                   |
| 11 And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him,   |
| as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down   |
| to the earth:\                                                        |
| 12 Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and     |
| wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.\              |
| 13 And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.\        |
| 14 But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing     |
| that is common or unclean.\                                           |

| heaven.\                                                              |

| seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had  |
| made inquiry for Simon\'s house, and stood before the gate,\          |

| Behold, three men seek thee.\                                         |
| 20 Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting     |
| nothing: for I have sent them.\                                       |

| repented not:\                                                        |
| 15 So again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem    |
| and to the house of Judah: fear ye not.\                              |

| neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these are things that I    |
| hate, saith the LORD.\                                                |
| 18 And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me, saying,\           |

| the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of   |
| the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and       |
| cheerful feasts; therefore love the truth and peace.\                 |
| 20 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; It shall yet come to pass, that      |
| there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities:\         |
| 21 And the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, Let   |
| us go speedily to pray before the LORD, and to seek the LORD of       |

| 36 The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching     |

| 37 That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all      |
| Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John          |

| power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed |
| of the devil; for God was with him.\                                  |
| 39 And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land   |

| 40 Him God raised up the third day, and showed him openly;\           |
| 41 Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God,    |

| 43 To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name        |
| whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.\          |
| 44 While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them |
| which heard the word.\                                                |
| 45 And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as    |
| many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured |
| out the gift of the Holy Ghost.\                                      |
| 46 For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then      |
| answered Peter,\                                                      |

| have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?\                          |
