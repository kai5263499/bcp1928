| **Psalm 86. Inclina, Domine.**\                                       |
| BOW down thine ear, O LORD, and hear me; \* for I am poor, and in     |
| misery.\                                                              |
| 2 Preserve thou my soul, for I am holy: \* my God, save thy servant   |
| that putteth his trust in thee.\                                      |
| 3 Be merciful unto me, O Lord; \* for I will call daily upon thee.\   |
| 4 Comfort the soul of thy servant; \* for unto thee, O Lord, do I     |
| lift up my soul.\                                                     |
| 5 For thou, Lord, art good and gracious, \* and of great mercy unto   |
| all them that call upon thee.\                                        |
| 6 Give ear, LORD, unto my prayer, \* and ponder the voice of my       |
| humble desires.\                                                      |
| 7 In the time of my trouble I will call upon thee; \* for thou        |
| hearest me.\                                                          |
| 8 Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; \* there is    |
| not one that can do as thou doest.\                                   |
| 9 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship thee, O      |
| Lord; \* and shall glorify thy Name.\                                 |
| 10 For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: \* thou art God     |
| alone.\                                                               |
| 11 Teach me thy way, O LORD, and I will walk in thy truth: \* O knit  |
| my heart unto thee, that I may fear thy Name.\                        |
| 12 I will thank thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart; \* and will   |
| praise thy Name for evermore.\                                        |
| 13 For great is thy mercy toward me; \* and thou hast delivered my    |
| soul from the nethermost hell.\                                       |
| 14 O God, the proud are risen against me; \* and the congregations of |
| violent men have sought after my soul, and have not set thee before   |
| their eyes.\                                                          |
| 15 But thou, O Lord God, art full of compassion and mercy, \*         |
| long-suffering, plenteous in goodness and truth.\                     |
| 16 O turn thee then unto me, and have mercy upon me; \* give thy      |
| strength unto thy servant, and help the son of thine handmaid.\       |
| 17 Show some token upon me for good; that they who hate me may see    |
| it, and be ashamed, \* because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and        |
| comforted me.\                                                        |

| Psalm 87. Fundamenta ejus.**\                                         |
| HER foundations are upon the holy hills: \* the LORD loveth the gates |
| of Sion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.\                        |
| 2 Very excellent things are spoken of thee, \* thou city of God.\     |
| 3 I will make mention of Egypt and Babylon, \* among them that know   |
| me.\                                                                  |
| 4 Behold, Philistia also; and Tyre, with Ethiopia; \* lo, in Sion     |
| were they born.\                                                      |
| 5 Yea, of Sion it shall be reported, this one and that one were born  |
| in her; \* and the Most High shall stablish her.\                     |
| 6 The LORD shall record it, when he writeth up the peoples; \* lo, in |
| Sion were they born.\                                                 |
| 7 The singers also and trumpeters shall make answer: \* All my fresh  |

| Psalm 88. Domine, Deus.**\                                            |
| O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee:   |
| \* O let my prayer enter into thy presence, incline thine ear unto my |
| calling;\                                                             |
| 2 For my soul is full of trouble, \* and my life draweth nigh unto    |
| the grave.\                                                           |
| 3 I am counted as one of them that go down into the pit, \* and I am  |
| even as a man that hath no strength;\                                 |
| 4 Cast off among the dead, like unto them that are slain, and lie in  |
| the grave, \* who are out of remembrance, and are cut away from thy   |
| hand.\                                                                |
| 5 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, \* in a place of darkness, and |
| in the deep.\                                                         |
| 6 Thine indignation lieth hard upon me, \* and thou hast vexed me     |
| with all thy storms.\                                                 |
| 7 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me, \* and made me to |
| be abhorred of them.\                                                 |
| 8 I am so fast in prison \* that I cannot get forth.\                 |
| 9 My sight faileth for very trouble; \* LORD, I have called daily     |
| upon thee, I have stretched forth my hands unto thee.\                |
| 10 Dost thou show wonders among the dead? \* or shall the dead rise   |
| up again, and praise thee?\                                           |
| 11 Shall thy loving-kindness be showed in the grave? \* or thy        |
| faithfulness in destruction?\                                         |
| 12 Shall thy wondrous works be known in the dark? \* and thy          |
| righteousness in the land where all things are forgotten?\            |
| 13 Unto thee have I cried, O LORD; \* and early shall my prayer come  |
| before thee.\                                                         |
| 14 LORD, why abhorrest thou my soul, \* and hidest thou thy face from |
| me?\                                                                  |
| 15 I am in misery, and like unto him that is at the point to die; \*  |
| even from my youth up, thy terrors have I suffered with a troubled    |
| mind.\                                                                |
| 16 Thy wrathful displeasure goeth over me, \* and the fear of thee    |
| hath undone me.\                                                      |
| 17 They came round about me daily like water, \* and compassed me     |
| together on every side.\                                              |
| 18 My lovers and friends hast thou put away from me, \* and hid mine  |
| acquaintance out of my sight.\                                        |
|                                                                       |

| **Psalm 89. Misericordias Domini**.\                                  |
| MY song shall be alway of the loving-kindness of the LORD; \* with my |
| mouth will I ever be showing thy truth from one generation to         |
| another.\                                                             |
| 2 For I have said, Mercy shall be set up for ever; \* thy truth shalt |
| thou stablish in the heavens.\                                        |
| 3 I have made a covenant with my chosen; \* I have sworn unto David   |
| my servant:\                                                          |
| 4 Thy seed will I stablish for ever, \* and set up thy throne from    |
| one generation to another.\                                           |
| 5 O LORD, the very heavens shall praise thy wondrous works; \* and    |
| thy truth in the congregation of the saints.\                         |
| 6 For who is he among the clouds, \* that shall be compared unto the  |
| LORD?\                                                                |
| 7 And what is he among the gods, \* that shall be like unto the       |
| LORD?\                                                                |
| 8 God is very greatly to be feared in the council of the saints, \*   |
| and to be had in reverence of all them that are round about him.\     |
| 9 O Lord God of hosts, who is like unto thee? \* thy truth, most      |
| mighty LORD, is on every side.\                                       |
| 10 Thou rulest the raging of the sea; \* thou stillest the waves      |
| thereof when they arise.\                                             |
| 11 Thou hast subdued Egypt, and destroyed it; \* thou hast scattered  |
| thine enemies abroad with thy mighty arm.\                            |
| 12 The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine; \* thou hast laid  |
| the foundation of the round world, and all that therein is.\          |
| 13 Thou hast made the north and the south; \* Tabor and Hermon shall  |
| rejoice in thy Name.\                                                 |
| 14 Thou hast a mighty arm; \* strong is thy hand, and high is thy     |
| right hand.\                                                          |
| 15 Righteousness and equity are the habitation of thy seat; \* mercy  |
| and truth shall go before thy face.\                                  |
| 16 Blessed is the people, O LORD, that can rejoice in thee; \* they   |
| shall walk in the light of thy countenance.\                          |
| 17 Their delight shall be daily in thy Name; \* and in thy            |
| righteousness shall they make their boast.\                           |
| 18 For thou art the glory of their strength, \* and in thy            |
| loving-kindness thou shalt lift up our horns.\                        |
| 19 For the LORD is our defence; \* the Holy One of Israel is our      |
| King.\                                                                |
| 20 Thou spakest sometime in visions unto thy saints, and saidst, \* I |
| have laid help upon one that is mighty, I have exalted one chosen out |
| of the people.\                                                       |
| 21 I have found David my servant; \* with my holy oil have I anointed |
| him.\                                                                 |
| 22 My hand shall hold him fast, \* and my arm shall strengthen him.\  |
| 23 The enemy shall not be able to do him violence; \* the son of      |
| wickedness shall not hurt him.\                                       |
| 24 I will smite down his foes before his face, \* and plague them     |
| that hate him.\                                                       |
| 25 My truth also and my mercy shall be with him; \* and in my Name    |
| shall his horn be exalted.\                                           |
| 26 I will set his dominion also in the sea, \* and his right hand in  |
| the floods.\                                                          |
| 27 He shall call me, Thou art my Father, \* my God, and my strong     |
| salvation.\                                                           |
| 28 And I will make him my firstborn, \* higher than the kings of the  |
| earth.\                                                               |
| 29 My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, \* and my covenant      |
| shall stand fast with him.\                                           |
| 30 His seed also will I make to endure for ever, \* and his throne as |
| the days of heaven.\                                                  |
| 31 But if his children forsake my law, \* and walk not in my          |
| judgments;\                                                           |
| 32 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; \* I will |
| visit their offences with the rod, and their sin with scourges.\      |
| 33 Nevertheless, my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from him, |
| \* nor suffer my truth to fail.\                                      |
| 34 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out |
| of my lips: \* I have sworn once by my holiness, that I will not fail |
| David.\                                                               |
| 35 His seed shall endure for ever, \* and his throne is like as the   |
| sun before me.\                                                       |
| 36 He shall stand fast for evermore as the moon, \* and as the        |
| faithful witness in heaven.\                                          |
| 37 But thou hast abhorred and forsaken thine anointed, \* and art     |
| displeased at him.\                                                   |
| 38 Thou hast broken the covenant of thy servant, \* and cast his      |
| crown to the ground.\                                                 |
| 39 Thou hast overthrown all his hedges, \* and broken down his        |
| strongholds.\                                                         |
| 40 All they that go by spoil him, \* and he is become a reproach to   |
| his neighbours.\                                                      |
| 41 Thou hast set up the right hand of his enemies, \* and made all    |
| his adversaries to rejoice.\                                          |
| 42 Thou hast taken away the edge of his sword, \* and givest him not  |
| victory in the battle.\                                               |
| 43 Thou hast put out his glory, \* and cast his throne down to the    |
| ground.\                                                              |
| 44 The days of his youth hast thou shortened, \* and covered him with |
| dishonour.\                                                           |
| 45 LORD, how long wilt thou hide thyself? for ever? \* and shall thy  |
| wrath burn like fire?\                                                |
| 46 O remember how short my time is; \* wherefore hast thou made all   |
| men for nought?\                                                      |
| 47 What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? \* and shall  |
| he deliver his soul from the power of the grave?\                     |
| 48 Lord, where are thy old loving-kindnesses, \* which thou swarest   |
| unto David in thy truth?\                                             |
| 49 Remember, Lord, the rebuke that thy servants have, \* and how I do |
| bear in my bosom the rebukes of many people;\                         |
| 50 Wherewith thine enemies have blasphemed thee, \* and slandered the |
| footsteps of thine anointed.\                                         |
| 51 Praised be the LORD for evermore. \* Amen, and Amen.               |
|                                                                       |
