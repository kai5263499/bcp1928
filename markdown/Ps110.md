| **Psalm 110. Dixit Dominus.**\                                        |
| THE LORD said unto my Lord, \* Sit thou on my right hand, until I     |
| make thine enemies thy footstool.\                                    |
| 2 The LORD shall send the rod of thy power out of Sion: \* be thou    |
| ruler, even in the midst among thine enemies.\                        |
| 3 In the day of thy power shall thy people offer themselves willingly |
| with an holy worship: \* thy young men come to thee as dew from the   |
| womb of the morning.\                                                 |
| 4 The LORD sware, and will not repent, \* Thou art a Priest for ever  |
| after the order of Melchizedek.\                                      |
| 5 The Lord upon thy right hand \* shall wound even kings in the day   |
| of his wrath.\                                                        |
| 6 He shall judge among the heathen; \* he shall fill the places with  |
| the dead bodies, and smite in sunder the heads over divers            |
| countries.\                                                           |
| 7 He shall drink of the brook in the way; \* therefore shall he lift  |
| up his head.                                                          |
