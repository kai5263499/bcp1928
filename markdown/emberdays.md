| O ALMIGHTY God, who hast committed to the hands of men the ministry   |
| of reconciliation; We humbly beseech thee, by the inspiration of thy  |
| Holy Spirit, to put it into the hearts of many to offer themselves    |
| for this ministry; that thereby mankind may be drawn to thy blessed   |
| kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\                        |

| THE next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the  |
| word of God. But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled   |
| with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul,  |
| contradicting and blaspheming. Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and |
| said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been    |
| spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves    |
| unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles. For so     |
| hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of  |
| the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of   |
| the earth. And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and      |
| glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to       |
| eternal life believed. And the word of the Lord was published         |
| throughout all the region.\                                           |

| The Gospel. St. Luke iv. 16.                                          |

| JESUS came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his     |
| custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood  |
| up for to read. And there was delivered unto him the book of the      |
| prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place   |
| where it was written, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he   |
| hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to |
| heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and    |
| recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are     |
| bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. And he closed the |
| book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the     |
| eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him. And |
| he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in    |
| your ears.                                                            |
