**Psalm 90. Domine, refugium.**\
LORD, thou hast been our refuge, \* from one generation to another.\
2 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and the
world were made, \* thou art God from everlasting, and world without
end.\
3 Thou turnest man to destruction; \* again thou sayest, Come again, ye
children of men.\
4 For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is
past, \* and as a watch in the night.\
5 As soon as thou scatterest them they are even as a sleep; \* and fade
away suddenly like the grass.\
6 In the morning it is green, and groweth up; \* but in the evening it
is cut down, dried up, and withered.\
7 For we consume away in thy displeasure, \* and are afraid at thy
wrathful indignation.\
8 Thou hast set our misdeeds before thee; \* and our secret sins in the
light of thy countenance.\
9 For when thou art angry all our days are gone: \* we bring our years
to an end, as it were a tale that is told.\
10 The days of our age are threescore years and ten; and though men be
so strong that they come to fourscore years, \* yet is their strength
then but labour and sorrow; so soon passeth it away, and we are gone.\
11 But who regardeth the power of thy wrath? \* or feareth aright thy
indignation?\
12 So teach us to number our days, \* that we may apply our hearts unto
wisdom.\
13 Turn thee again, O LORD, at the last, \* and be gracious unto thy
servants.\
14 O satisfy us with thy mercy, and that soon: \* so shall we rejoice
and be glad all the days of our life.\
15 Comfort us again now after the time that thou hast plagued us; \* and
for the years wherein we have suffered adversity.\
16 Show thy servants thy work, \* and their children thy glory.\
17 And the glorious majesty of the LORD our God be upon us: \* prosper
thou the work of our hands upon us; O prosper thou our handy-work.\

**Psalm 91. Qui habitat.**\
WHOSO dwelleth under the defence of the Most High, \* shall abide under
the shadow of the Almighty.\
2 I will say unto the LORD, Thou art my hope, and my stronghold; \* my
God, in him will I trust.\
3 For he shall deliver thee from the snare of the hunter, \* and from
the noisome pestilence.\
4 He shall defend thee under his wings, and thou shalt be safe under his
feathers; \* his faithfulness and truth shall be thy shield and
buckler.\
5 Thou shalt not be afraid for any terror by night, \* nor for the arrow
that flieth by day;\
6 For the pestilence that walketh in darkness, \* nor for the sickness
that destroyeth in the noon-day.\
7 A thousand shall fall beside thee, and ten thousand at thy right hand;
\* but it shall not come nigh thee.\
8 Yea, with thine eyes shalt thou behold, \* and see the reward of the
ungodly.\
9 For thou, LORD, art my hope; \* thou hast set thine house of defence
very high.\
10 There shall no evil happen unto thee, \* neither shall any plague
come nigh thy dwelling.\
11 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, \* to keep thee in all
thy ways.\
12 They shall bear thee in their hands, \* that thou hurt not thy foot
against a stone.\
13 Thou shalt go upon the lion and adder: \* the young lion and the
dragon shalt thou tread under thy feet.\
14 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him;
\* I will set him up, because he hath known my Name.\
15 He shall call upon me, and I will hear him; \* yea, I am with him in
trouble; I will deliver him, and bring him to honour.\
16 With long life will I satisfy him, \* and show him my salvation.\

**Psalm 92. Bonum est confiteri.**\
IT is a good thing to give thanks unto the LORD, \* and to sing praises
unto thy Name, O Most Highest;\
2 To tell of thy loving-kindness early in the morning, \* and of thy
truth in the night season;\
3 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the lute; \* upon a loud
instrument, and upon the harp.\
4 For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy works; \* and I will
rejoice in giving praise for the operations of thy hands.\
5 O LORD, how glorious are thy works! \* thy thoughts are very deep.\
6 An unwise man doth not well consider this, \* and a fool doth not
understand it.\
7 When the ungodly are green as the grass, and when all the workers of
wickedness do flourish, \* then shall they be destroyed for ever; but
thou, LORD, art the Most Highest for evermore.\
8 For lo, thine enemies, O LORD, lo, thine enemies shall perish; \* and
all the workers of wickedness shall be destroyed.\
9 But my horn shall be exalted like the horn of an unicorn; \* for I am
anointed with fresh oil.\
10 Mine eye also shall see his lust of mine enemies, \* and mine ear
shall hear his desire of the wicked that arise up against me.\
11 The righteous shall flourish like a palm-tree, \* and shall spread
abroad like a cedar in Lebanon.\
12 Such as are planted in the house of the LORD, \* shall flourish in
the courts of the house of our God.\
13 They also shall bring forth more fruit in their age, \* and shall be
fat and well-liking;\
14 That they may show how true the LORD my strength is, \* and that
there is no unrighteousness in him.
