| \                                                                     |
|                                                                       |
| **Psalm 139. Domine, probasti.**\                                     |
| O LORD, thou hast searched me out, and known me. \* Thou knowest my   |
| down-sitting, and mine uprising; thou understandest my thoughts long  |
| before.\                                                              |
| 2 Thou art about my path, and about my bed; \* and art acquainted     |
| with all my ways.\                                                    |
| 3 For lo, there is not a word in my tongue, \* but thou, O LORD,      |
| knowest it altogether.\                                               |
| 4 Thou hast beset me behind and before, \* and laid thine hand upon   |
| me.\                                                                  |
| 5 Such knowledge is too wonderful and excellent for me; \* I cannot   |
| attain unto it.\                                                      |
| 6 Whither shall I go then from thy Spirit? \* or whither shall I go   |
| then from thy presence?\                                              |
| 7 If I climb up into heaven, thou art there; \* if I go down to hell, |
| thou art there also.\                                                 |
| 8 If I take the wings of the morning, \* and remain in the uttermost  |
| parts of the sea;\                                                    |
| 9 Even there also shall thy hand lead me, \* and thy right hand shall |
| hold me.\                                                             |
| 10 If I say, Peradventure the darkness shall cover me; \* then shall  |
| my night be turned to day.\                                           |
| 11 Yea, the darkness is no darkness with thee, but the night is as    |
| clear as the day; \* the darkness and light to thee are both alike.\  |
| 12 For my reins are thine; \* thou hast covered me in my mother\'s    |
| womb.\                                                                |
| 13 I will give thanks unto thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully   |
| made: \* marvellous are thy works, and that my soul knoweth right     |
| well.\                                                                |
| 14 My bones are not hid from thee, \* though I be made secretly, and  |
| fashioned beneath in the earth.\                                      |
| 15 Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being imperfect; \* and in    |
| thy book were all my members written;\                                |
| 16 Which day by day were fashioned, \* when as yet there was none of  |
| them.\                                                                |
| 17 How dear are thy counsels unto me, O God; \* O how great is the    |
| sum of them!\                                                         |
| 18 If I tell them, they are more in number than the sand: \* when I   |
| wake up, I am present with thee.\                                     |
| 19 Wilt thou not slay the wicked, O God? \* Depart from me, ye        |
| blood-thirsty men.\                                                   |
| 20 For they speak unrighteously against thee; \* and thine enemies    |
| take thy Name in vain.\                                               |
| 21 Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? \* and am not I        |
| grieved with those that rise up against thee?\                        |
| 22 Yea, I hate them right sore; \* even as though they were mine      |
| enemies.\                                                             |
| 23 Try me, O God, and seek the ground of my heart; \* prove me, and   |
| examine my thoughts.\                                                 |
| 24 Look well if there be any way of wickedness in me; \* and lead me  |
| in the way everlasting.                                               |
