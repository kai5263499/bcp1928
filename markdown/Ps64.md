| **Psalm 64. Exaudi, Deus.**\                                          |
| HEAR my voice, O God, in my prayer; \* preserve my life from fear of  |
| the enemy.\                                                           |
| 2 Hide me from the gathering together of the froward, \* and from the |
| insurrection of wicked doers;\                                        |
| 3 Who have whet their tongue like a sword, \* and shoot out their     |
| arrows, even bitter words;\                                           |
| 4 That they may privily shoot at him that is perfect: \* suddenly do  |
| they hit him, and fear not.\                                          |
| 5 They encourage themselves in mischief, \* and commune among         |
| themselves, how they may lay snares; and say, that no man shall see   |
| them.\                                                                |
| 6 They imagine wickedness, and practise it; \* that they keep secret  |
| among themselves, every man in the deep of his heart.\                |
| 7 But God shall suddenly shoot at them with a swift arrow, \* that    |
| they shall be wounded.\                                               |
| 8 Yea, their own tongues shall make them fall; \* insomuch that whoso |
| seeth them shall laugh them to scorn.\                                |
| 9 And all men that see it shall say, This hath God done; \* for they  |
| shall perceive that it is his work.\                                  |
| 10 The righteous shall rejoice in the LORD, and put his trust in him; |
| \* and all they that are true of heart shall be glad.                 |
