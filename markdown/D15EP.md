**Psalm 78. Attendite, popule.**\
HEAR my law, O my people; \* incline your ears unto the words of my
mouth.\
2 I will open my mouth in a parable; \* I will declare hard sentences of
old;\
3 Which we have heard and known, \* and such as our fathers have told
us;\
4 That we should not hide them from the children of the generations to
come; \* but to show the honour of the LORD, his mighty and wonderful
works that he hath done.\
5 He made a covenant with Jacob, and gave Israel a law, \* which he
commanded our forefathers to teach their children;\
6 That their posterity might know it, \* and the children which were yet
unborn;\
7 To the intent that when they came up, \* they might show their
children the same;\
8 That they might put their trust in God; \* and not to forget the works
of God, but to keep his commandments;\
9 And not to be as their forefathers, a faithless and stubborn
generation; \* a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose
spirit clave not stedfastly unto God;\
10 Like as the children of Ephraim; \* who being harnessed, and carrying
bows, turned themselves back in the day of battle.\
11 They kept not the covenant of God, \* and would not walk in his law;\
12 But forgat what he had done, \* and the wonderful works that he had
showed for them.\
13 Marvellous things did he in the sight of our forefathers, in the land
of Egypt, \* even in the field of Zoan.\
14 He divided the sea, and let them go through; \* he made the waters to
stand on an heap.\
15 In the day-time also he led them with a cloud, \* and all the night
through with a light of fire.\
16 He clave the hard rocks in the wilderness, \* and gave them drink
thereof, as it had been out of the great depth.\
17 He brought waters out of the stony rock, \* so that it gushed out
like the rivers.\
18 Yet for all this they sinned more against him, \* and provoked the
Most Highest in the wilderness.\
19 They tempted God in their hearts, \* and required meat for their
lust.\
20 They spake against God also, saying, \* Shall God prepare a table in
the wilderness?\
21 He smote the stony rock indeed, that the water gushed out, and the
streams flowed withal; \* but can he give bread also, or provide flesh
for his people?\
22 When the LORD heard this, he was wroth; \* so the fire was kindled in
Jacob, and there came up heavy displeasure against Israel;\
23 Because they believed not in God, \* and put not their trust in his
help.\
24 So he commanded the clouds above, \* and opened the doors of heaven.\
25 He rained down manna also upon them for to eat, \* and gave them food
from heaven.\
26 So man did eat angels\' food; \* for he sent them meat enough.\
27 He caused the east-wind to blow under heaven; \* and through his
power he brought in the southwest-wind.\
28 He rained flesh upon them as thick as dust, \* and feathered fowls
like as the sand of the sea.\
29 He let it fall among their tents, \* even round about their
habitation.\
30 So they did eat, and were well filled; for he gave them their own
desire: \* they were not disappointed of their lust.\
31 But while the meat was yet in their mouths, the heavy wrath of God
came upon them, and slew the wealthiest of them; \* yea, and smote down
the chosen men that were in Israel.\
32 But for all this they sinned yet more, \* and believed not his
wondrous works.\
33 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, \* and their years in
trouble.\
34 When he slew them, they sought him, \* and turned them early, and
inquired after God.\
35 And they remembered that God was their strength, \* and that the High
God was their redeemer.\
36 Nevertheless, they did but flatter him with their mouth, \* and
dissembled with him in their tongue.\
37 For their heart was not whole with him, \* neither continued they
stedfast in his covenant.\
38 But he was so merciful, that he forgave their misdeeds, \* and
destroyed them not.\
39 Yea, many a time turned he his wrath away, \* and would not suffer
his whole displeasure to arise.\
40 For he considered that they were but flesh, \* and that they were
even a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.\
41 Many a time did they provoke him in the wilderness, \* and grieved
him in the desert.\
42 They turned back, and tempted God, \* and provoked the Holy One in
Israel.\
43 They thought not of his hand, \* and of the day when he delivered
them from the hand of the enemy;\
44 How he had wrought his miracles in Egypt, \* and his wonders in the
field of Zoan.\
45 He turned their waters into blood, \* so that they might not drink of
the rivers.\
46 He sent flies among them, and devoured them up; \* and frogs to
destroy them.\
47 He gave their fruit unto the caterpillar, \* and their labour unto
the grasshopper.\
48 He destroyed their vines with hailstones, \* and their mulberry-trees
with the frost.\
49 He smote their cattle also with hailstones, \* and their flocks with
hot thunderbolts.\
50 He cast upon them the furiousness of his wrath, anger, displeasure,
and trouble: \* and sent evil angels among them.\
51 He made a way to his indignation, and spared not their soul from
death; \* but gave their life over to the pestilence;\
52 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt, \* the most principal and
mightiest in the dwellings of Ham.\
53 But as for his own people, he led them forth like sheep, \* and
carried them in the wilderness like a flock.\
54 He brought them out safely, that they should not fear, \* and
overwhelmed their enemies with the sea.\
55 And brought them within the borders of his sanctuary, \* even to this
mountain, which he purchased with his right hand.\
56 He cast out the heathen also before them, \* caused their land to be
divided among them for an heritage, and made the tribes of Israel to
dwell in their tents.\
57 Yet they tempted and displeased the Most High God, \* and kept not
his testimonies.\
58 They turned their backs, and fell away like their forefathers; \*
starting aside like a broken bow.\
59 For they grieved him with their hill-altars, \* and provoked him to
displeasure with their images.\
60 When God heard this, he was wroth, \* and took sore displeasure at
Israel;\
61 So that he forsook the tabernacle in Shiloh, \* even the tent that he
had pitched among men.\
62 He delivered their power into captivity, \* and their beauty into the
enemy\'s hand\
63 He gave his people over also unto the sword, \* and was wroth with
his inheritance.\
64 The fire consumed their young men, \* and their maidens were not
given in marriage.\
65 Their priests were slain with the sword, \* and there were no widows
to make lamentation.\
66 So the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, \* and like a giant refreshed
with wine.\
67 He drave his enemies backward, \* and put them to a perpetual shame.\
68 He refused the tabernacle of Joseph, \* and chose not the tribe of
Ephraim;\
69 But chose the tribe of Judah, \* even the hill of Sion which he
loved.\
70 And there he built his temple on high, \* and laid the foundation of
it like the ground which he hath made continually.\
71 He chose David also his servant, \* and took him away from the
sheep-folds:\
72 As he was following the ewes with their young he took him, \* that he
might feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.\
73 So he fed them with a faithful and true heart, \* and ruled them
prudently with all his power.
