| **Psalm 75. Confitebimur tibi.**\                                     |
| UNTO thee, O God, do we give thanks; \* yea, unto thee do we give     |
| thanks.\                                                              |
| 2 Thy Name also is so nigh; \* and that do thy wondrous works         |
| declare.\                                                             |
| 3 In the appointed time, saith God, \* I shall judge according unto   |
| right.\                                                               |
| 4 The earth is weak, and all the inhabiters thereof: \* I bear up the |
| pillars of it.\                                                       |
| 5 I said unto the fools, Deal not so madly; \* and to the ungodly,    |
| Set not up your horn.\                                                |
| 6 Set not up your horn on high, \* and speak not with a stiff neck.\  |
| 7 For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, \*   |
| nor yet from the south.\                                              |

| 9 For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; \* |
| it is full mixt, and he poureth out of the same.\                     |
| 10 As for the dregs thereof, \* all the ungodly of the earth shall    |
| drink them, and suck them out.\                                       |
| 11 But I will talk of the God of Jacob, \* and praise him for ever.\  |
| 12 All the horns of the ungodly also will I break, \* and the horns   |
| of the righteous shall be exalted.\                                   |

| Psalm 76. Notus in Judaea.**\                                         |
| IN Judah is God known; \* his Name is great in Israel.\               |
| 2 At Salem is his tabernacle, \* and his dwelling in Sion.\           |
| 3 There brake he the arrows of the bow, \* the shield, the sword, and |
| the battle.\                                                          |
| 4 Thou art glorious in might, \* when thou comest from the hills of   |
| the robbers.\                                                         |
| 5 The proud are robbed, they have slept their sleep; \* and all the   |
| men whose hands were mighty have found nothing.\                      |
| 6 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, \* both the chariot and horse are    |
| fallen.\                                                              |
| 7 Thou, even thou art to be feared; \* and who may stand in thy sight |
| when thou art angry?\                                                 |
| 8 Thou didst cause thy judgment to be heard from heaven; \* the earth |
| trembled, and was still,\                                             |
| 9 When God arose to judgment, \* and to help all the meek upon        |
| earth.\                                                               |
| 10 The fierceness of man shall turn to thy praise; \* and the         |
| fierceness of them shalt thou refrain.\                               |
| 11 Promise unto the LORD your God, and keep it, all ye that are round |
| about him; \* bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.\       |
| 12 He shall refrain the spirit of princes, \* and is wonderful among  |
| the kings of the earth.\                                              |
| **\                                                                   |
| Psalm 77. Voce mea ad Dominum.**\                                     |
| I WILL cry unto God with my voice; \* even unto God will I cry with   |
| my voice, and he shall hearken unto me.\                              |
| 2 In the time of my trouble I sought the Lord: \* I stretched forth   |
| my hands unto him, and ceased not in the night season; my soul        |
| refused comfort.\                                                     |
| 3 When I am in heaviness, I will think upon God; \* when my heart is  |
| vexed, I will complain.\                                              |
| 4 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: \* I am so feeble that I cannot      |
| speak.\                                                               |
| 5 I have considered the days of old, \* and the years that are past.\ |
| 6 I call to remembrance my song, \* and in the night I commune with   |
| mine own heart, and search out my spirit.\                            |
| 7 Will the Lord absent himself for ever? \* and will he be no more    |
| intreated?\                                                           |
| 8 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? \* and is his promise come        |
| utterly to an end for evermore?\                                      |
| 9 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? \* and will he shut up his       |
| loving-kindness in displeasure?\                                      |
| 10 And I said, It is mine own infirmity; \* but I will remember the   |
| years of the right hand of the Most Highest.\                         |
| 11 I will remember the works of the LORD, \* and call to mind thy     |
| wonders of old time.\                                                 |
| 12 I will think also of all thy works, \* and my talking shall be of  |
| thy doings.\                                                          |
| 13 Thy way, O God, is holy: \* who is so great a God as our God?\     |
| 14 Thou art the God that doest wonders, \* and hast declared thy      |
| power among the peoples.\                                             |
| 15 Thou hast mightily delivered thy people, \* even the sons of Jacob |
| and Joseph.\                                                          |
| 16 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee, and were afraid;  |
| \* the depths also were troubled.\                                    |
| 17 The clouds poured out water, the air thundered, \* and thine       |
| arrows went abroad.\                                                  |
| 18 The voice of thy thunder was heard round about: \* the lightnings  |
| shone upon the ground; the earth was moved, and shook withal.\        |
| 19 Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in the great waters, \* and   |
| thy footsteps are not known.\                                         |

| Aaron.\                                                               |

| **Psalm 78. Attendite, popule.**\                                     |
| HEAR my law, O my people; \* incline your ears unto the words of my   |
| mouth.\                                                               |
| 2 I will open my mouth in a parable; \* I will declare hard sentences |
| of old;\                                                              |
| 3 Which we have heard and known, \* and such as our fathers have told |
| us;\                                                                  |
| 4 That we should not hide them from the children of the generations   |
| to come; \* but to show the honour of the LORD, his mighty and        |
| wonderful works that he hath done.\                                   |
| 5 He made a covenant with Jacob, and gave Israel a law, \* which he   |
| commanded our forefathers to teach their children;\                   |
| 6 That their posterity might know it, \* and the children which were  |
| yet unborn;\                                                          |
| 7 To the intent that when they came up, \* they might show their      |
| children the same;\                                                   |
| 8 That they might put their trust in God; \* and not to forget the    |
| works of God, but to keep his commandments;\                          |
| 9 And not to be as their forefathers, a faithless and stubborn        |
| generation; \* a generation that set not their heart aright, and      |
| whose spirit clave not stedfastly unto God;\                          |
| 10 Like as the children of Ephraim; \* who being harnessed, and       |
| carrying bows, turned themselves back in the day of battle.\          |
| 11 They kept not the covenant of God, \* and would not walk in his    |
| law;\                                                                 |
| 12 But forgat what he had done, \* and the wonderful works that he    |
| had showed for them.\                                                 |
| 13 Marvellous things did he in the sight of our forefathers, in the   |
| land of Egypt, \* even in the field of Zoan.\                         |
| 14 He divided the sea, and let them go through; \* he made the waters |
| to stand on an heap.\                                                 |
| 15 In the day-time also he led them with a cloud, \* and all the      |
| night through with a light of fire.\                                  |
| 16 He clave the hard rocks in the wilderness, \* and gave them drink  |
| thereof, as it had been out of the great depth.\                      |
| 17 He brought waters out of the stony rock, \* so that it gushed out  |
| like the rivers.\                                                     |
| 18 Yet for all this they sinned more against him, \* and provoked the |
| Most Highest in the wilderness.\                                      |
| 19 They tempted God in their hearts, \* and required meat for their   |
| lust.\                                                                |
| 20 They spake against God also, saying, \* Shall God prepare a table  |
| in the wilderness?\                                                   |
| 21 He smote the stony rock indeed, that the water gushed out, and the |
| streams flowed withal; \* but can he give bread also, or provide      |
| flesh for his people?\                                                |
| 22 When the LORD heard this, he was wroth; \* so the fire was kindled |
| in Jacob, and there came up heavy displeasure against Israel;\        |
| 23 Because they believed not in God, \* and put not their trust in    |
| his help.\                                                            |
| 24 So he commanded the clouds above, \* and opened the doors of       |
| heaven.\                                                              |
| 25 He rained down manna also upon them for to eat, \* and gave them   |
| food from heaven.\                                                    |
| 26 So man did eat angels\' food; \* for he sent them meat enough.\    |
| 27 He caused the east-wind to blow under heaven; \* and through his   |
| power he brought in the southwest-wind.\                              |
| 28 He rained flesh upon them as thick as dust, \* and feathered fowls |
| like as the sand of the sea.\                                         |
| 29 He let it fall among their tents, \* even round about their        |
| habitation.\                                                          |
| 30 So they did eat, and were well filled; for he gave them their own  |
| desire: \* they were not disappointed of their lust.\                 |
| 31 But while the meat was yet in their mouths, the heavy wrath of God |
| came upon them, and slew the wealthiest of them; \* yea, and smote    |
| down the chosen men that were in Israel.\                             |
| 32 But for all this they sinned yet more, \* and believed not his     |
| wondrous works.\                                                      |
| 33 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, \* and their years  |
| in trouble.\                                                          |
| 34 When he slew them, they sought him, \* and turned them early, and  |
| inquired after God.\                                                  |
| 35 And they remembered that God was their strength, \* and that the   |
| High God was their redeemer.\                                         |
| 36 Nevertheless, they did but flatter him with their mouth, \* and    |
| dissembled with him in their tongue.\                                 |
| 37 For their heart was not whole with him, \* neither continued they  |
| stedfast in his covenant.\                                            |
| 38 But he was so merciful, that he forgave their misdeeds, \* and     |
| destroyed them not.\                                                  |
| 39 Yea, many a time turned he his wrath away, \* and would not suffer |
| his whole displeasure to arise.\                                      |
| 40 For he considered that they were but flesh, \* and that they were  |
| even a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.\                 |
| 41 Many a time did they provoke him in the wilderness, \* and grieved |
| him in the desert.\                                                   |
| 42 They turned back, and tempted God, \* and provoked the Holy One in |
| Israel.\                                                              |
| 43 They thought not of his hand, \* and of the day when he delivered  |
| them from the hand of the enemy;\                                     |
| 44 How he had wrought his miracles in Egypt, \* and his wonders in    |
| the field of Zoan.\                                                   |
| 45 He turned their waters into blood, \* so that they might not drink |
| of the rivers.\                                                       |
| 46 He sent flies among them, and devoured them up; \* and frogs to    |
| destroy them.\                                                        |
| 47 He gave their fruit unto the caterpillar, \* and their labour unto |
| the grasshopper.\                                                     |
| 48 He destroyed their vines with hailstones, \* and their             |
| mulberry-trees with the frost.\                                       |
| 49 He smote their cattle also with hailstones, \* and their flocks    |
| with hot thunderbolts.\                                               |
| 50 He cast upon them the furiousness of his wrath, anger,             |
| displeasure, and trouble: \* and sent evil angels among them.\        |
| 51 He made a way to his indignation, and spared not their soul from   |
| death; \* but gave their life over to the pestilence;\                |
| 52 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt, \* the most principal and    |
| mightiest in the dwellings of Ham.\                                   |
| 53 But as for his own people, he led them forth like sheep, \* and    |
| carried them in the wilderness like a flock.\                         |
| 54 He brought them out safely, that they should not fear, \* and      |
| overwhelmed their enemies with the sea.\                              |
| 55 And brought them within the borders of his sanctuary, \* even to   |
| this mountain, which he purchased with his right hand.\               |
| 56 He cast out the heathen also before them, \* caused their land to  |
| be divided among them for an heritage, and made the tribes of Israel  |
| to dwell in their tents.\                                             |
| 57 Yet they tempted and displeased the Most High God, \* and kept not |
| his testimonies.\                                                     |
| 58 They turned their backs, and fell away like their forefathers; \*  |
| starting aside like a broken bow.\                                    |
| 59 For they grieved him with their hill-altars, \* and provoked him   |
| to displeasure with their images.\                                    |
| 60 When God heard this, he was wroth, \* and took sore displeasure at |
| Israel;\                                                              |
| 61 So that he forsook the tabernacle in Shiloh, \* even the tent that |
| he had pitched among men.\                                            |
| 62 He delivered their power into captivity, \* and their beauty into  |
| the enemy\'s hand\                                                    |
| 63 He gave his people over also unto the sword, \* and was wroth with |
| his inheritance.\                                                     |
| 64 The fire consumed their young men, \* and their maidens were not   |
| given in marriage.\                                                   |
| 65 Their priests were slain with the sword, \* and there were no      |
| widows to make lamentation.\                                          |
| 66 So the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, \* and like a giant        |
| refreshed with wine.\                                                 |
| 67 He drave his enemies backward, \* and put them to a perpetual      |
| shame.\                                                               |
| 68 He refused the tabernacle of Joseph, \* and chose not the tribe of |
| Ephraim;\                                                             |
| 69 But chose the tribe of Judah, \* even the hill of Sion which he    |
| loved.\                                                               |
| 70 And there he built his temple on high, \* and laid the foundation  |
| of it like the ground which he hath made continually.\                |
| 71 He chose David also his servant, \* and took him away from the     |
| sheep-folds:\                                                         |
| 72 As he was following the ewes with their young he took him, \* that |
| he might feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.\          |
| 73 So he fed them with a faithful and true heart, \* and ruled them   |
| prudently with all his power.                                         |
|                                                                       |
