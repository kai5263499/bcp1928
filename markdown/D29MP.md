**Psalm 139. Domine, probasti.**\
O LORD, thou hast searched me out, and known me. \* Thou knowest my
down-sitting, and mine uprising; thou understandest my thoughts long
before.\
2 Thou art about my path, and about my bed; \* and art acquainted with
all my ways.\
3 For lo, there is not a word in my tongue, \* but thou, O LORD, knowest
it altogether.\
4 Thou hast beset me behind and before, \* and laid thine hand upon me.\
5 Such knowledge is too wonderful and excellent for me; \* I cannot
attain unto it.\
6 Whither shall I go then from thy Spirit? \* or whither shall I go then
from thy presence?\
7 If I climb up into heaven, thou art there; \* if I go down to hell,
thou art there also.\
8 If I take the wings of the morning, \* and remain in the uttermost
parts of the sea;\
9 Even there also shall thy hand lead me, \* and thy right hand shall
hold me.\
10 If I say, Peradventure the darkness shall cover me; \* then shall my
night be turned to day.\
11 Yea, the darkness is no darkness with thee, but the night is as clear
as the day; \* the darkness and light to thee are both alike.\
12 For my reins are thine; \* thou hast covered me in my mother\'s
womb.\
13 I will give thanks unto thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully
made: \* marvellous are thy works, and that my soul knoweth right well.\
14 My bones are not hid from thee, \* though I be made secretly, and
fashioned beneath in the earth.\
15 Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being imperfect; \* and in thy
book were all my members written;\
16 Which day by day were fashioned, \* when as yet there was none of
them.\
17 How dear are thy counsels unto me, O God; \* O how great is the sum
of them!\
18 If I tell them, they are more in number than the sand: \* when I wake
up, I am present with thee.\
19 Wilt thou not slay the wicked, O God? \* Depart from me, ye
blood-thirsty men.\
20 For they speak unrighteously against thee; \* and thine enemies take
thy Name in vain.\
21 Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? \* and am not I grieved
with those that rise up against thee?\
22 Yea, I hate them right sore; \* even as though they were mine
enemies.\
23 Try me, O God, and seek the ground of my heart; \* prove me, and
examine my thoughts.\
24 Look well if there be any way of wickedness in me; \* and lead me in
the way everlasting.\

**Psalm 140. Eripe me, Domine.**\
DELIVER me, O LORD, from the evil man; \* and preserve me from the
wicked man;\
2 Who imagine mischief in their hearts, \* and stir up strife all the
day long.\
3 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; \* adder\'s poison
is under their lips.\
4 Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the ungodly; \* preserve me from
the wicked men, who are purposed to overthrow my goings.\
5 The proud have laid a snare for me, and spread a net abroad with
cords; \* yea, and set traps in my way.\
6 I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God, \* hear the voice of my
prayers, O LORD.\
7 O LORD God, thou strength of my health; \* thou hast covered my head
in the day of battle.\
8 Let not the ungodly have his desire, O LORD; \* let not his
mischievous imagination prosper, lest they be too proud.\
9 Let the mischief of their own lips fall upon the head of them \* that
compass me about.\
10 Let hot burning coals fall upon them; \* let them be cast into the
fire, and into the pit, that they never rise up again.\
11 A man full of words shall not prosper upon the earth: \* evil shall
hunt the wicked person to overthrow him.\
12 Sure I am that the LORD will avenge the poor, \* and maintain the
cause of the helpless.\
13 The righteous also shall give thanks unto thy Name; \* and the just
shall continue in thy sight.
