| WHEN the LORD turned again the captivity of Sion, then were we like   |
| unto them that dream.\                                                |
| 2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, \* and our tongue with     |
| joy.\                                                                 |
| 3 Then said they among the heathen, \* The LORD hath done great       |
| things for them.\                                                     |
| 4 Yea, the LORD hath done great things for us already; \* whereof we  |
| rejoice.\                                                             |
| 5 Turn our captivity, O LORD, \* as the rivers in the south.\         |
| 6 They that sow in tears \* shall reap in joy.\                       |
| 7 He that now goeth on his way weeping, and beareth forth good seed,  |
| \* shall doubtless come again with joy, and bring his sheaves with    |
| him.                                                                  |
