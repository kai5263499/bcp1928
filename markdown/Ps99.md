| **Psalm 99. Dominus regnavit.**\                                      |
| THE LORD is King, be the people never so impatient; \* he sitteth     |
| between the Cherubim, be the earth never so unquiet.\                 |
| 2 The LORD is great in Sion, \* and high above all people.\           |
| 3 They shall give thanks unto thy Name, \* which is great, wonderful, |
| and holy.\                                                            |
| 4 The King\'s power loveth judgment; thou hast prepared equity, \*    |
| thou hast executed judgment and righteousness in Jacob.\              |
| 5 O magnify the LORD our God, and fall down before his footstool; \*  |
| for he is holy.\                                                      |
| 6 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among such as call    |
| upon his Name: \* these called upon the LORD, and he heard them.\     |
| 7 He spake unto them out of the cloudy pillar; \* for they kept his   |
| testimonies, and the law that he gave them.\                          |
| 8 Thou heardest them, O LORD our God; \* thou forgavest them, O God,  |
| though thou didst punish their wicked doings.\                        |
| 9 O magnify the LORD our God, and worship him upon his holy hill; \*  |
| for the LORD our God is holy.                                         |
