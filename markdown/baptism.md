| *¶ The Minister of every Parish shall often admonish the People, that |
| they defer not the Baptism of their Children, and that it is most     |
| convenient that Baptism should be administered upon Sundays and other |
| Holy Days. Nevertheless, if necessity so require, Baptism may be      |
| administered upon any other day. And also he shall warn them that,    |
| except for urgent cause, they seek not to have their Children         |
| baptized in their houses.\                                            |
| ¶ There shall be for every Male-child to be baptized. when they can   |
| be had, two Godfathers and one Godmother; and for every Female, one   |
| Godfather and two Godmothers; and Parents shall be admitted as        |
| Sponsors, if it be desired.\                                          |
| ¶ When there are Children to be baptized, the Parents or Sponsors     |
| shall give knowledge thereof to the Minister. And then the Godfathers |
| and Godmothers, and the People with the Children, must be ready at    |
| the Font, either immediately after the Second Lesson at Morning or    |
| Evening Prayer, or at such other time as the Minister shall appoint.\ |
| ¶ When any such Persons as are of riper years are to be baptized,     |
| timely notice shall be given to the Minister, that so due care may be |
| taken for their examination, whether they be sufficiently instructed  |
| in the Principles of the Christian Religion; and that they may be     |
| exhorted to prepare themselves, with Prayers and Fasting, for the     |
| receiving of this holy Sacrament. And Note, That at the time of the   |
| Baptism of an Adult, there shall be present with him at the Font at   |
| least two Witnesses.\                                                 |
| \                                                                     |
| ¶ The Minister, having come to the Font, which is then to be filled   |
| with pure Water, shall say as followeth, the People all standing,*    |
|                                                                       |
| \                                                                     |
| HATH this Child (Person) been already baptized, or no?                |
|                                                                       |
| \                                                                     |
| *¶ If they answer,* No: *then shall the Minister proceed as           |
| followeth.*                                                           |
|                                                                       |
| \                                                                     |
| DEARLY beloved, forasmuch as our Saviour Christ saith, None can enter |
| into the kingdom of God, except he be regenerate and born anew of     |
| Water and of the Holy Ghost; I beseech you to call upon God the       |
| Father, through our Lord Jesus Christ, that of his bounteous mercy he |
| will grant to *this Child (this Person)* that which by nature *he*    |
| cannot have; that *he* may be baptized with Water and the Holy Ghost, |
| and received into Christ\'s holy Church, and be made a living member  |
| of the same.                                                          |
|                                                                       |
| *¶ Then shall the Minister say,*                                      |
|                                                                       |
| Let us pray.                                                          |
|                                                                       |
| ALMIGHTY and immortal God, the aid of all who need, the helper of all |
| who flee to thee for succour, the life of those who believe, and the  |
| resurrection of the dead; We call upon thee for *this Child (this thy |
| Servant),* that *he,* coming to thy holy Baptism, may receive         |
| remission of sin, by spiritual regeneration. Receive *him,* O Lord,   |
| as thou hast promised by thy well-beloved Son, saying, Ask, and ye    |
| shall have; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened    |
| unto you. So give now unto us who ask; let us who seek, find; open    |
| the gate unto us who knock; that *this Child (this thy Servant)* may  |
| enjoy the everlasting benediction of thy heavenly washing, and may    |
| come to the eternal kingdom which thou hast promised by Christ our    |
| Lord. Amen.                                                           |
|                                                                       |
| *¶ Then the Minister shall say as followeth.*                         |
|                                                                       |
| Hear the words of the Gospel, written by Saint Mark, in the tenth     |
| Chapter, at the thirteenth Verse.\                                    |
| \                                                                     |
| THEY brought young children to Christ, that he should touch them: and |
| his disciples rebuked those that brought them. But when Jesus saw it, |
| he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little         |
| children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the     |
| kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive    |
| the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein. And |
| he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed     |
| them.                                                                 |
|                                                                       |
| *¶ Or this.*                                                          |
|                                                                       |
| Hear the words of the Gospel, written by Saint John, in the third     |
| Chapter, at the first Verse.\                                         |
| \                                                                     |
| THERE was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the     |
| Jews: the same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we   |
| know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these   |
| miracles that thou doest, except God be with him. Jesus answered and  |
| said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born  |
| again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus saith unto him,    |
| How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time    |
| into his mother\'s womb, and be born? Jesus answered, Verily, verily, |
| I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he  |
| cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh |
| is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not  |
| that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where  |
| it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell    |
| whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born  |
| of the Spirit.                                                        |
|                                                                       |
| *¶ Or this.*                                                          |
|                                                                       |
| Hear the words of the Gospel, written by Saint Matthew, in the        |
| twenty-eighth Chapter, at the eighteenth Verse.\                      |
| \                                                                     |
| JESUS came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in |
| heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all       |
| nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son,    |
| and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever |
| I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end |
| of the world.                                                         |
|                                                                       |
| *¶ Then shall the Minister say,*                                      |
|                                                                       |
| AND now, being persuaded of the good will of our heavenly Father      |
| toward *this Child (this Person),* declared by his Son Jesus Christ;  |
| let us faithfully and devoutly give thanks unto him, and say,\        |
| \                                                                     |
| ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, heavenly Father, We give thee humble    |
| thanks, That thou hast vouchsafed to call us To the knowledge of thy  |
| grace, and faith in thee: Increase this knowledge, And confirm this   |
| faith in us evermore. Give thy Holy Spirit to *this Child (this thy   |
| Servant),* That *he* may be born again, And be made an heir of        |
| everlasting salvation; Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Who liveth and  |
| reigneth with thee and the same Holy Spirit, Now and for ever. Amen.  |

| \                                                                     |
| **Minister.*** The Lord be with you.\                                 |
| ***Answer.*** And with thy spirit.\                                   |
| ***Minister.*** Lift up your hearts.\                                 |
| ***Answer.*** We lift them up unto the Lord.\                         |
| ***Minister.*** Let us give thanks unto our Lord God.\                |
| ***Answer.*** It is meet and right so to do.                          |

| *¶ Then the Minister shall say,*                                      |
|                                                                       |
| IT is very meet, right, and our bounden duty, that we should give     |
| thanks unto thee, O Lord, Holy Father, Almighty, Everlasting God, for |
| that thy dearly beloved Son Jesus Christ, for the forgiveness of our  |
| sins, did shed out of his most precious side both water and blood;    |
| and gave commandment to his disciples, that they should go teach all  |
| nations, and baptize them In the Name of the Father, and of the Son,  |
| and of the Holy Ghost. Regard, we beseech thee, the supplications of  |
| thy congregation; sanctify this Water to the mystical washing away of |
| sin; and grant that this Child (this thy Servant), now to be baptized |
| therein, may receive the fulness of thy grace, and ever remain in the |
| number of thy faithful children; through the same Jesus Christ our    |
| Lord, to whom, with thee, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, be all     |
| honour and glory, now and evermore. Amen.                             |
|                                                                       |
| *¶ Then the Minister shall take the Child into his arms, and shall    |
| say to the Godfathers and Godmothers,*                                |
|                                                                       |
| Name this Child.                                                      |
|                                                                       |
| *¶ And then, naming the Child after them, he shall dip him in the     |
| Water discreetly, or shall pour Water upon him, saying,*              |
|                                                                       |
| \                                                                     |
| N. I baptize thee In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of   |
| the Holy Ghost. Amen.                                                 |
|                                                                       |
| *¶ But NOTE, That if the Person to be baptized be an Adult, the       |
| Minister shall take him by the hand, and shall ask the Witnesses the  |
| Name; and then shall dip him in the Water, or pour Water upon him,    |
| using the same form of words.*                                        |
|                                                                       |
| ¶ Then the Minister shall say,                                        |
|                                                                       |
| WE receive this *Child (Person)* into the congregation of Christ\'s   |
| flock; and do sign *him* with the sign of the Cross, in token that    |
| hereafter *he* shall not be ashamed to confess the faith of Christ    |
| crucified, and manfully to fight under his banner, against sin, the   |
| world, and the devil; and to continue Christ\'s faithful soldier and  |
| servant unto *his* life\'s end*. Amen.*                               |
|                                                                       |
| ¶ Then shall the Minister say,                                        |
|                                                                       |
| SEEING now, dearly beloved brethren, that *this Child (this Person)*  |
| is regenerate, and grafted into the body of Christ\'s Church, let us  |
| give thanks unto Almighty God for these benefits; and with one accord |
| make our prayers unto him, that *this Child (this Person)* may lead   |
| the rest of *his* life according to this beginning.                   |
|                                                                       |
| *¶ Then shall be said,*                                               |
|                                                                       |
| OUR Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom      |
| come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day |
| our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive those   |
| who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, But deliver |
| us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, |
| for ever and ever. Amen.                                              |
|                                                                       |
| *¶ Then shall the Minister say,*                                      |
|                                                                       |
| WE yield thee hearty thanks, most merciful Father, that it hath       |
| pleased thee to regenerate *this Child (this thy Servant)* with thy   |
| Holy Spirit, to receive *him* for thine own Child, and to incorporate |
| *him* into thy holy Church. And humbly we beseech thee to grant, that |
| *he,* being dead unto sin, may live unto righteousness, and being     |
| buried with Christ in his death, may also be partaker of his          |
| resurrection; so that finally, with the residue of thy holy Church,   |
| *he* may be an inheritor of thine everlasting kingdom; through Christ |
| our Lord. Amen.                                                       |
|                                                                       |
| *¶ Then the Minister shall add,*                                      |
|                                                                       |
| THE Almighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the    |
| whole family in heaven and earth is named; Grant you to be            |
| strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; that, Christ  |
| dwelling in your hearts by faith, ye may be filled with all the       |
| fulness of God. Amen.                                                 |
|                                                                       |
| *¶ It is expedient that every Adult, thus baptized, should be         |
| confirmed by the Bishop, so soon after his Baptism as conveniently    |
| may be; that so he may be admitted to the Holy Communion.*            |
|                                                                       |
| **PRIVATE BAPTISM.**                                                  |
|                                                                       |
| *¶ When, in consideration of extreme sickness, necessity may require, |
| then the following form shall suffice:\                               |
| ¶ The Child (or Person) being named by some one who is present, the   |
| Minister shall pour Water upon him, saying these words:*              |
|                                                                       |
| \                                                                     |
| N. I baptize thee In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of   |
| the Holy Ghost. Amen.                                                 |
|                                                                       |
| *¶ After which shall be said the Lord\'s Prayer, and the Thanksgiving |
| from this Office, beginning, We yield thee hearty thanks, etc.\       |
| ¶ But NOTE, That in the case of an Adult, the Minister shall first    |
| ask the questions provided in this Office for the Baptism of Adults.\ |
| ¶ In cases of extreme sickness, or any imminent peril, if a Minister  |
| cannot be procured, then any baptized person present may administer   |
| holy Baptism, using the foregoing form. Such Baptism shall be         |
| promptly reported to the Parish authorities.*                         |
|                                                                       |
| **THE RECEIVING OF ONE PRIVATELY BAPTIZED.**                          |
|                                                                       |
| *¶ It is expedient that a Child or Person so baptized be afterward    |
| brought to the Church, at which time these parts of the foregoing     |
| service shall be used:\                                               |
| The Gospel, the Questions (omitting the question Wilt thou be         |
| baptized in this Faith? and the answer thereto), the Declaration, We  |
| receive this Child (or Person), etc., and the remainder of the        |
| Office.*                                                              |
|                                                                       |
| **CONDITIONAL BAPTISM.**                                              |
|                                                                       |
| *¶ If there be reasonable doubt whether any person was baptized with  |
| Water, In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy     |
| Ghost. (which are essential parts of Baptism), such person may be     |
| baptized in the form before appointed in the Office; saving that, at  |
| the immersion or the pouring of water, the Minister shall use the     |
| form of words:*                                                       |
|                                                                       |
| \                                                                     |
| IF thou art not already baptized, N., I baptize thee In the Name of   |
| the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.\             |
