\
Morning Prayer.

**Psalm 107. Confitemini Domino.**\
O GIVE thanks unto the LORD, for he is gracious, \* and his mercy
endureth for ever.\
2 Let them give thanks whom the LORD hath redeemed, \* and delivered
from the hand of the enemy;\
3 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west;
\* from the north, and from the south.\
4 They went astray in the wilderness out of the way, \* and found no
city to dwell in.\
5 Hungry and thirsty, \* their soul fainted in them.\
6 So they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, \* and he delivered them
from their distress.\
7 He led them forth by the right way, \* that they might go to the city
where they dwelt.\
8 O that men would therefore praise the LORD for his goodness; \* and
declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men!\
9 For he satisfieth the empty soul, \* and filleth the hungry soul with
goodness.\
10 Such as sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death, \* being fast
bound in misery and iron;\
11 Because they rebelled against the words of the Lord, \* and lightly
regarded the counsel of the Most Highest;\
12 He also brought down their heart through heaviness: \* they fell
down, and there was none to help them.\
13 SO when they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, \* he delivered
them out of their distress.\
14 For he brought them out of darkness, and out of the shadow of death,
\* and brake their bonds in sunder.\
15 O that men would therefore praise the LORD for his goodness; \* and
declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men !\
16 For he hath broken the gates of brass, \* and smitten the bars of
iron in sunder.\
17 Foolish men are plagued for their offence, \* and because of their
wickedness.\
18 Their soul abhorred all manner of meat, \* and they were even hard at
death\'s door.\
19 So when they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, \* he delivered
them out of their distress.\
20 He sent his word, and healed them; \* and they were saved from their
destruction.\
21 O that men would therefore praise the LORD for his goodness; \* and
declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men !\
22 That they would offer unto him the sacrifice of thanksgiving, \* and
tell out his works with gladness!\
23 They that go down to the sea in ships, \* and occupy their business
in great waters;\
24 These men see the works of the LORD, \* and his wonders in the deep.\
25 For at his word the stormy wind ariseth, \* which lifteth up the
waves thereof.\
26 They are carried up to the heaven, and down again to the deep; \*
their soul melteth away because of the trouble.\
27 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, \* and are at
their wit\'s end.\
28 SO when they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, \* he delivereth
them out of their distress.\
29 For he maketh the storm to cease, \* so that the waves thereof are
still.\
30 Then are they glad, because they are at rest; \* and so he bringeth
them unto the haven where they would be.\
31 O that men would therefore praise the LORD for his goodness; \* and
declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men!\
32 That they would exalt him also in the congregation of the people, \*
and praise him in the seat of the elders!\
33 He turneth the floods into a wilderness, \* and drieth up the
water-springs.\
34 A fruitful land maketh he barren, \* for the wickedness of them that
dwell therein.\
35 Again, he maketh the wilderness a standing water, \* and
water-springs of a dry ground.\
36 And there he setteth the hungry, \* that they may build them a city
to dwell in;\
37 That they may sow their land, and plant vineyards, \* to yield them
fruits of increase.\
38 He blesseth them, so that they multiply exceedingly; \* and suffereth
not their cattle to decrease.\
39 And again, when they are minished and brought low \* through
oppression, through any plague or trouble;\
40 Though he suffer them to be evil entreated through tyrants, \* and
let them wander out of the way in the wilderness;\
41 Yet helpeth he the poor out of misery, \* and maketh him households
like a flock of sheep.\
42 The righteous will consider this, and rejoice; \* and the mouth of
all wickedness shall be stopped.\
43 Whoso is wise, will ponder these things; \* and they shall understand
the loving-kindness of the LORD.\

Evening Prayer.

**Psalm 108. Paratum cor meum.**\
O GOD, my heart is ready, my heart is ready; \* I will sing, and give
praise with the best member that I have.\
2 Awake, thou lute and harp; \* I myself will awake right early.\
3 I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the peoples; \* I will
sing praises unto thee among the nations.\
4 For thy mercy is greater than the heavens, \* and thy truth reacheth
unto the clouds.\
5 Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens, \* and thy glory above all
the earth;\
6 That thy beloved may be delivered: \* let thy right hand save them,
and hear thou me.\
7 God hath spoken in his holiness; \* I will rejoice therefore, and
divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.\
8 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; \* Ephraim also is the strength
of my head; Judah is my lawgiver;\
9 Moab is my wash-pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; \* upon
Philistia will I triumph.\
10 Who will lead me into the strong city? \* and who will bring me into
Edom?\
11 Hast not thou forsaken us, O God? \* and wilt not thou, O God, go
forth with our hosts?\
12 O help us against the enemy: \* for vain is the help of man.\
13 Through God we shall do great acts; \* and it is he that shall tread
down our enemies.\
\
**\
Psalm 109. Deus, laudem.**\
HOLD not thy tongue, O God of my praise; \* for the mouth of the
ungodly, yea, the mouth of the deceitful is opened upon me.\
2 And they have spoken against me with false tongues; \* they compassed
me about also with words of hatred, and fought against me without a
cause.\
3 For the love that I had unto them, lo, they take now my contrary part;
\* but I give myself unto prayer.\
4 Thus have they rewarded me evil for good, \* and hatred for my good
will.\
5 Set thou an ungodly man to be ruler over him, \* and let an adversary
stand at his right hand.\
6 When sentence is given upon him, let him be condemned; \* and let his
prayer be turned into sin.\
7 Let his days be few; \* and let another take his office.\
8 Let his children be fatherless, \* and his wife a widow.\
9 Let his children be vagabonds, and beg their bread; \* let them seek
it also out of desolate places.\
10 Let the extortioner consume all that he hath; \* and let the stranger
spoil his labour.\
11 Let there be no man to pity him, \* nor to have compassion upon his
fatherless children.\
12 Let his posterity be destroyed; \* and in the NEXT

![](http://stats.superstats.com/b/ss/DAVIDMCMANNES/1){border="0"}

generation let his name be clean put out.\
13 Let the wickedness of his fathers be had in remembrance in the sight
of the LORD; \* and let not the sin of his mother be done away.\
14 Let them alway be before the LORD, \* that he may root out the
memorial of them from off the earth;\
15 And that, because his mind was not to do good; \* but persecuted the
poor helpless man, that he might slay him that was vexed at the heart.\
16 His delight was in cursing, and it shall happen unto him; \* he loved
not blessing, therefore shall it be far from him.\
17 He clothed himself with cursing like as with a raiment, \* and it
shall come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.\
18 Let it be unto him as the cloak that he hath upon him, \* and as the
girdle that he is alway girded withal.\
19 Let it thus happen from the LORD unto mine enemies, \* and to those
that speak evil against my soul.\
20 But deal thou with me, O LORD God, according unto thy Name; \* for
sweet is thy mercy.\
21 O deliver me, for I am helpless and poor, \~ and my heart is wounded
within me.\
22 I go hence like the shadow that departeth, \* and am driven away as
the grasshopper.\
23 My knees are weak through fasting; \* my flesh is dried up for want
of fatness.\
24 I am become also a reproach unto them: \* they that look upon me
shake their heads.\
25 Help me, O LORD my God; \* O save me according to thy mercy;\
26 And they shall know how that this is thy hand, \* and that thou,
LORD, hast done it.\
27 Though they curse, yet bless thou; \* and let them be confounded that
rise up against me; but let thy servant rejoice.\
28 Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame; \* and let them cover
themselves with their own confusion, as with a cloak.\
29 As for me, I will give great thanks unto the LORD with my mouth, \*
and praise him among the multitude;\
30 For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, \* to save his soul
from unrighteous judges.\

The Twenty-third Day.\
\
Morning Prayer.

**Psalm 110. Dixit Dominus.**\
THE LORD said unto my Lord, \* Sit thou on my right hand, until I make
thine enemies thy footstool.\
2 The LORD shall send the rod of thy power out of Sion: \* be thou
ruler, even in the midst among thine enemies.\
3 In the day of thy power shall thy people offer themselves willingly
with an holy worship: \* thy young men come to thee as dew from the womb
of the morning.\
4 The LORD sware, and will not repent, \* Thou art a Priest for ever
after the order of Melchizedek.\
5 The Lord upon thy right hand \* shall wound even kings in the day of
his wrath.\
6 He shall judge among the heathen; \* he shall fill the places with the
dead bodies, and smite in sunder the heads over divers countries.\
7 He shall drink of the brook in the way; \* therefore shall he lift up
his head.\
\
**\
Psalm 111. Confitebor tibi.**\
I WILL give thanks unto the LORD with my whole heart, \* secretly among
the faithful, and in the congregation.\
2 The works of the LORD are great, \* sought out of all them that have
pleasure therein.\
3 His work is worthy to be praised and had in honour, \* and his
righteousness endureth for ever.\
4 The merciful and gracious LORD hath so done his marvellous works, \*
that they ought to be had in remembrance.\
5 He hath given meat unto them that fear him; \* he shall ever be
mindful of his covenant.\
6 He hath showed his people the power of his works, \* that he may give
them the heritage of the heathen.\
7 The works of his hands are verity and judgment; \* all his
commandments are true.\
8 They stand fast for ever and ever, \* and are done in truth and
equity.\
9 He sent redemption unto his people; \* he hath commanded his covenant
for ever; holy and reverend is his Name.\
10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; \* a good
understanding have all they that do thereafter; his praise endureth for
ever.\
\
**\
Psalm 112. Beatus vir.**\
BLESSED is the man that feareth the LORD; \* he hath great delight in
his commandments.\
2 His seed shall be mighty upon earth; \* the generation of the faithful
shall be blessed.\
3 Riches and plenteousness shall be in his house; \* and his
righteousness endureth for ever.\
4 Unto the godly there ariseth up light in the darkness; \* he is
merciful, loving, and righteous.\
5 A good man is merciful, and lendeth; \* and will guide his words with
discretion.\
6 For he shall never be moved: \* and the righteous shall be had in
everlasting remembrance.\
7 He will not be afraid of any evil tidings; \* for his heart standeth
fast, and believeth in the LORD.\
8 His heart is stablished, and will not shrink, \* until he see his
desire upon his enemies.\
9 He hath dispersed abroad, and given to the poor. \* and his
righteousness remaineth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with
honour.\
10 The ungodly shall see it, and it shall grieve him; \* he shall gnash
with his teeth, and consume away; the desire of the ungodly shall
perish.\
\
**\
Psalm 113. Laudate, pueri.**\
PRAISE the LORD, ye servants; \* O praise the Name of the LORD.\
2 Blessed be the Name of the LORD \* from this time forth for evermore.\
3 The LORD\'S Name is praised \* from the rising up of the sun unto the
going down of the same.\
4 The LORD is high above all nations, \* and his glory above the
heavens.\
5 Who is like unto the LORD our God, that hath his dwelling so high, \*
and yet humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven and
earth!\
6 He taketh up the simple out of the dust, \* and lifteth the poor out
of the mire;\
7 That he may set him with the princes, \* even with the princes of his
people.\
8 He maketh the barren woman to keep house, \* and to be a joyful mother
of children.\

Evening Prayer.

**Psalm 114. In exitu Israel.**\
WHEN Israel came out of Egypt, \* and the house of Jacob from among the
strange people,\
2 Judah was his sanctuary, \* and Israel his dominion.\
3 The sea saw that, and fled; \* Jordan was driven back.\
4 The mountains skipped like rams, \* and the little hills like young
sheep.\
5 What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? \* and thou Jordan,
that thou wast driven back?\
6 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams? \* and ye little hills, like
young sheep?\
7 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord: \* at the presence
of the God of Jacob;\
8 Who turned the hard rock into a standing water, \': and the
flint-stone into a springing well.\
\
**\
Psalm 115. Non nobis, Domine.**\
NOT unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy Name give the praise; \*
for thy loving mercy, and for thy truth\'s sake.\
2 Wherefore shall the heathen say, \* Where is now their God?\
3 As for our God, he is in heaven: \* he hath done whatsoever pleased
him.\
4 Their idols are silver and gold, \* even the work of men\'s hands.\
5 They have mouths, and speak not; \* eyes have they, and see not.\
6 They have ears, and hear not; \* noses have they, and smell not.\
7 They have hands, and handle not; feet have they, and walk not; \*
neither speak they through their throat.\
8 They that make them are like unto them; \* and so are all such as put
their trust in them.\
9 But thou, house of Israel, trust thou in the LORD; \* he is their
helper and defender.\
10 Ye house of Aaron, put your trust in the LORD; \* he is their helper
and defender.\
11 Ye that fear the LORD, put your trust in the LORD; \* he is their
helper and defender.\
12 The LORD hath been mindful of us, and he shall bless us; \* even he
shall bless the house of Israel, he shall bless the house of Aaron.\
13 He shall bless them that fear the LORD, \* both small and great.\
14 The LORD shall increase you more and more, \* you and your children.\
15 Ye are the blessed of the LORD, \* who made heaven and earth.\
16 All the whole heavens are the LORD\'S; \* the earth hath he given to
the children of men.\
17 The dead praise not thee, O LORD, \* neither all they that go down
into silence.\
18 But we will praise the LORD, \* from this time forth for evermore.
Praise the LORD.\

The Twenty-fourth Day.\
\
Morning Prayer.

**Psalm 116. Dilexi, quoniam.**\
MY delight is in the LORD; \* because he hath heard the voice of my
prayer;\
2 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me; \* therefore will I call
upon him as long as I live.\
3 The snares of death compassed me round about, \* and the pains of hell
gat hold upon me.\
4 I found trouble and heaviness; then called I upon the Name of the
LORD; \* O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.\
5 Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; \* yea, our God is merciful.\
6 The LORD preserveth the simple: \* I was in misery, and he helped me.\
7 Turn again then unto thy rest, O my soul; \* for the LORD hath
rewarded thee.\
8 And why? thou hast delivered my soul from death, \* mine eyes from
tears, and my feet from falling.\
9 I will walk before the LORD \* in the land of the living.\
10 I believed, and therefore will I speak; but I was sore troubled: \* I
said in my haste, All men are liars.\
11 What reward shall I give unto the LORD \* for all the benefits that
he hath done unto me?\
12 I will receive the cup of salvation, \* and call upon the Name of the
LORD.\
13 I will pay my vows now in the presence of all his people: \* right
dear in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.\
14 Behold, O LORD, how that I am thy servant; \* I am thy servant, and
the son of thine handmaid; thou hast broken my bonds in sunder.\
15 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, \* and will call
upon the Name of the LORD.\
16 I will pay my vows unto the LORD, in the sight of all his people, \*
in the courts of the LORD\'S house; even in the midst of thee, O
Jerusalem. Praise the LORD.\
\
**\
Psalm 117. Laudate Dominum.**\

Psalm 118. Confitemini Domino.**\
O GIVE thanks unto the LORD, for he is gracious; \* because his mercy
endureth for ever.\
2 Let Israel now confess that he is gracious, \* and that his mercy
endureth for ever.\
3 Let the house of Aaron now confess, \* that his mercy endureth for
ever.\
4 Yea, let them now that fear the LORD confess, \* that his mercy
endureth for ever.\
5 I called upon the LORD in trouble; \* and the LORD heard me at large.\
6 The LORD is on my side; \* I will not fear what man doeth unto me.\
7 The LORD taketh my part with them that help me; \* therefore shall I
see my desire upon mine enemies.\
8 It is better to trust in the LORD, \* than to put any confidence in
man.\
9 It is better to trust in the LORD, \* than to put any confidence in
princes.\
10 All nations compassed me round about; \* but in the Name of the LORD
will I destroy them.\
11 They kept me in on every side, they kept me in, I say, on every side;
\* but in the Name of the LORD will I destroy them.\
12 They came about me like bees, and are extinct even as the fire among
the thorns; \* for in the Name of the LORD I will destroy them.\
13 Thou hast thrust sore at me, that I might fall; \* but the LORD was
my help.\
14 The LORD is my strength, and my song; \* and is become my salvation.\
15 The voice of joy and health is in the dwellings of the righteous; \*
the right hand of the LORD bringeth mighty things to pass.\
16 The right hand of the LORD hath the pre-eminence; \* the right hand
of the LORD bringeth mighty things to pass.\
17 I shall not die, but live, \* and declare the works of the LORD.\
18 The LORD hath chastened and corrected me; \* but he hath not given me
over unto death.\
19 Open me the gates of righteousness, \* that I may go into them, and
give thanks unto the LORD.\
20 This is the gate of the LORD, \* the righteous shall enter into it.\
21 I will thank thee; for thou hast heard me, \* and art become my
salvation.\
22 The same stone which the builders refused, \* is become the
head-stone in the comer.\
23 This is the LORD\'S doing, \* and it is marvellous in our eyes.\
24 This is the day which the LORD hath made; \* we will rejoice and be
glad in it.\
25 Help me now, O LORD: \* O LORD, send us now prosperity.\
26 Blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the LORD: \* we have wished
you good luck, we that are of the house of the LORD.\
27 God is the LORD, who hath showed us light: \* bind the sacrifice with
cords, yea, even unto the horns of the altar.\
28 Thou art my God, and I will thank thee; \* thou art my God, and I
will praise thee.\
29 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is gracious, \* and his mercy
endureth for ever.\

whole heart;\
3 Even they who do no wickedness, \* and walk in his ways.\
4 Thou hast charged \* that we shall diligently keep thy commandments.\
5 O that my ways were made so direct, \* that I might keep thy
statutes!\
6 So shall I not be confounded, \* while I have respect unto all thy
commandments.\

mouth.\

word.\

20 My soul breaketh out for the very fervent desire \* that it hath
alway unto thy judgments.\
21 Thou hast rebuked the proud; \* and cursed are they that do err from
thy commandments.\
22 O turn from me shame and rebuke; \* for I have kept thy testimonies.\

unto thy word.\

thy law.\
30 I have chosen the way of truth, \* and thy judgments have I laid
before me.\

heart at liberty.\

82 Mine eyes-long sore for thy word; \* saying, O when wilt thou comfort
me?\
83 For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; \* yet do I not forget
thy statutes.\
84 How many are the days of thy servant? \* when wilt thou be avenged of
them that persecute me?\
85 The proud have digged pits for me, \* which are not after thy law.\
86 All thy commandments are true: \* they persecute me falsely; O be
thou my help.\
87 They had almost made an end of me upon earth; \* but I forsook not
thy commandments.\
88 O quicken me after thy loving-kindness; \* and so shall I keep the
testimonies of thy mouth.\
\
\
XII. In aeternum, Domine.\
O LORD, thy word \* endureth for ever in heaven. go Thy truth also
remaineth from one generation to another; \* thou hast laid the
foundation of the earth, and it abideth.\
91 They continue this day according to thine ordinance; \* for all
things serve thee.\
92 If my delight had not been in thy law, \* I should have perished in
my trouble.\
93 I will never forget thy commandments; \* for with them thou hast
quickened me.\
94 I am thine: O save me, \* for I have sought thy commandments.\
95 The ungodly laid wait for me, to destroy me; \* but I will consider
thy testimonies.\
96 I see that all things come to an end; \* but thy commandment is
exceeding broad.\
\
\
XIII. Quomodo dilexi!\
LORD, what love have I unto thy law! \* all the day long is my study in
it.\
98 Thou, through thy commandments, hast made me wiser than mine enemies;
\* for they are ever with me.\
99 I have more understanding than my teachers; \* for thy testimonies
are my study.\
100 I am wiser than the aged; \* because I keep thy commandments.\
101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, \* that I may keep thy
word.\
102 I have not shrunk from thy judgments; \* for thou teachest me.\
103 O how sweet are thy words unto my throat; \* yea, sweeter than honey
unto my mouth!\
104 Through thy commandments I get understanding: \* therefore I hate
all evil ways.\

word.\
108 Let the free-will offerings of my mouth please thee, O LORD; \* and
teach me thy judgments.\
109 My soul is alway in my hand; \* yet do I not forget thy law.\
110 The ungodly have laid a snare for me; \* but yet I swerved not from
thy commandments.\
111 Thy testimonies have I claimed as mine heritage for ever; \* and
why? they are the very joy of my heart.\
112 I have applied my heart to fulfil thy statutes alway, \* even unto
the end.\
\
\
XV. Iniquos odio habui.\
I HATE them that imagine evil things; \* but thy law do I love.\

116 O stablish me according to thy word, that I may live; \* and let me
not be disappointed of my hope.\
117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe; \* yea, my delight shall be
ever in thy statutes.\
118 Thou hast trodden down all them that depart from thy statutes; \*
for they imagine but deceit.\
119 Thou puttest away all the ungodly of the earth like dross; \*
therefore I love thy testimonies.\
120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; \* and I am afraid of thy
judgments.\
\
\
XVI. Feci judicium.\
I DEAL with the thing that is lawful and right; \* O give me not over
unto mine oppressors.\
122 Make thou thy servant to delight in that which is good, \* that the
proud do me no wrong.\
123 Mine eyes are wasted away with looking for thy health, \* and for
the word of thy righteousness.\
124 O deal with thy servant according unto thy loving mercy, \* and
teach me thy statutes.\
125 I am thy servant; O grant me understanding, \* that I may know thy
testimonies.\

ways I utterly abhor.\
\
\
XVII. Mirabilia.\
THY testimonies are wonderful; \* therefore doth my soul keep them.\
130 When thy word goeth forth, \* it giveth light and understanding unto
the simple.\
131 I opened my mouth, and drew in my breath; \* for my delight was in
thy commandments.\
132 O look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, \* as thou usest to do
unto those that love thy Name.\
133 Order my steps in thy word; \* and so shall no wickedness have
dominion over me.\
134 O deliver me from the wrongful dealings of men; \* and so shall I
keep thy commandments.\
135 Show the light of thy countenance upon thy servant, \* and teach me
thy statutes.\
136 Mine eyes gush out with water, \* because men keep not thy law.\
\
\
XVIII. Justus es, Domine.\
RIGHTEOUS art thou, O LORD; \* and true are thy judgments.\
138 The testimonies that thou hast commanded \* are exceeding righteous
and true.\
139 My zeal hath even consumed me; \* because mine enemies have
forgotten thy words.\
140 Thy word is tried to the uttermost, \* and thy servant loveth it.\
141 I am small and of no reputation; \* yet do I not forget thy
commandments.\
142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, \* and thy law is
the truth.\

The Twenty-seventh Day.\
\
Morning Prayer.

**Psalm 120. Ad Dominum.**\
WHEN I was in trouble, I called upon the LORD, \* and he heard me.\
2 Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, \* and from a deceitful
tongue.\
3 What reward shall be given or done unto thee, thou false tongue? \*
even mighty and sharp arrows, with hot burning coals.\
4 Woe is me, that I am constrained to dwell with Meshech, \* and to have
my habitation among the tents of Kedar!\
5 My soul hath long dwelt among them \* that are enemies unto peace.\
6 I labour for peace; but when I speak unto them thereof, \* they make
them ready to battle.\
\
**\
Psalm 121. Levavi oculos.**\
I WILL lift up mine eyes unto the hills; \* from whence cometh my help?\
2 My help cometh even from the LORD, \* who hath made heaven and earth.\
3 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved; \* and he that keepeth thee
will not sleep.\
4 Behold, he that keepeth Israel \* shall neither slumber nor sleep.\
5 The LORD himself is thy keeper; \* the LORD is thy defence upon thy
right hand;\
6 So that the sun shall not burn thee by day, \* neither the moon by
night.\
7 The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil; \* yea, it is even he that
shall keep thy soul.\
8 The LORD shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming in, \* from this
time forth for evermore.\
\
**\
Psalm 122. Laetatus sum.**\
I WAS glad when they said unto me, \* We will go into the house of the
LORD.\
2 Our feet shall stand in thy gates, \* O Jerusalem.\
3 Jerusalem is built as a city \* that is at unity in itself.\
4 For thither the tribes go up, even the tribes of the LORD, \* to
testify unto Israel, to give thanks unto the Name of the LORD.\
5 For there is the seat of judgment, \* even the seat of the house of
David.\
6 O pray for the peace of Jerusalem; \* they shall prosper that love
thee.\
7 Peace be within thy walls, \* and plenteousness within thy palaces.\
8 For my brethren and companions\' sakes, \* I will wish thee
prosperity.\
9 Yea, because of the house of the LORD our God, \* I will seek to do
thee good.\
\
**\
Psalm 123. Ad te levavi oculos meos.**\
UNTO thee lift I up mine eyes, \* O thou that dwellest in the heavens.\
2 Behold, even as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their
masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress, \*
even so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until he have mercy upon
us.\
3 Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us; \* for we are utterly
despised.\
4 Our soul is filled with the scornful reproof of the wealthy, \* and
with the despitefulness of the proud.\
\
**\
Psalm 124. Nisi quia Dominus.**\
IF the LORD himself had not been on our side, now may Israel say; \* if
the LORD himself had not been on our side, when men rose up against us;\
2 They had swallowed us up alive; \* when they were so wrathfully
displeased at us.\
3 Yea, the waters had drowned us, \* and the stream had gone over our
soul.\
4 The deep waters of the proud \* had gone even over our soul.\
5 But praised be the LORD, \* who hath not given us over for a prey unto
their teeth.\
6 Our soul is escaped even as a bird out of the snare of the fowler; \*
the snare is broken, and we are delivered.\
7 Our help standeth in the Name of the LORD, \* who hath made heaven and
earth.\
\
**\
Psalm 125. Qui confidunt.**\
THEY that put their trust in the LORD shall be even as the mount Sion,
\* which may not be removed, but standeth fast for ever.\
2 The hills stand about Jerusalem; \* even so standeth the LORD round
about his people, from this time forth for evermore.\
3 For the sceptre of the ungodly shall not abide upon the lot of the
righteous; \* lest the righteous put their hand unto wickedness.\
4 Do well, O LORD, \* unto those that are good and true of heart.\
5 As for such as turn back unto their own wickedness, \* the LORD shall
lead them forth with the evil doers; but peace shall be upon Israel.\
\

Evening Prayer.

**Psalm 126. In convertendo.**\
WHEN the LORD turned again the captivity of Sion, then were we like unto
them that dream.\
2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, \* and our tongue with joy.\
3 Then said they among the heathen, \* The LORD hath done great things
for them.\
4 Yea, the LORD hath done great things for us already; \* whereof we
rejoice.\
5 Turn our captivity, O LORD, \* as the rivers in the south.\
6 They that sow in tears \* shall reap in joy.\
7 He that now goeth on his way weeping, and beareth forth good seed, \*
shall doubtless come again with joy, and bring his sheaves with him.\
\
**\
Psalm 127. Nisi Dominus.**\
EXCEPT the LORD build the house, \* their labour is but lost that build
it.\
2 Except the LORD keep the city, \* the watchman waketh but in vain.\
3 It is but lost labour that ye haste to rise up early, and so late take
rest, and eat the bread of carefulness; \* for so he giveth his beloved
sleep.\
4 Lo, children, and the fruit of the womb, \* are an heritage and gift
that cometh of the LORD.\
5 Like as the arrows in the hand of the giant, \* even so are the young
children.\
6 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them; \* they shall not
be ashamed when they speak with their enemies in the gate.\
\
**\
Psalm 128. Beati omnes.**\
BLESSED are all they that fear the LORD, \* and walk in his ways.\
2 For thou shalt eat the labours of thine hands: \* O well is thee, and
happy shalt thou be.\
3 Thy wife shall be as the fruitful vine \* upon the walls of thine
house;\
4 Thy children like the olive-branches \* round about thy table.\
5 Lo, thus shall the man be blessed \* that feareth the LORD.\
6 The LORD from out of Sion shall so bless thee, \* that thou shalt see
Jerusalem in prosperity all thy life long;\
7 Yea, that thou shalt see thy children\'s children, \* and peace upon
Israel.\
\
**\
Psalm 129. Saepe expugnaverunt.**\
MANY a time have they fought against me from my youth up, \* may Israel
now say;\
2 Yea, many a time have they vexed me from my youth up; \* but they have
not prevailed against me.\
3 The plowers plowed upon my back, \* and made long furrows.\
4 But the righteous LORD \* hath hewn the snares of the ungodly in
pieces.\
5 Let them be confounded and turned backward, \* as many as have evil
will at Sion.\
6 Let them be even as the grass upon the housetops, \* which withereth
afore it be grown up;\
7 Whereof the mower filleth not his hand, \* neither he that bindeth up
the sheaves his bosom.\
8 So that they who go by say not so much as, The LORD prosper you; \* we
wish you good luck in the Name of the LORD.\
\
**\
Psalm 130. De profundis.**\
OUT of the deep have I called unto thee, O LORD; \* Lord, hear my
voice.\
2 O let thine ears consider well \* the voice of my complaint.\
3 If thou, LORD, wilt be extreme to mark what is done amiss, \* O Lord,
who may abide it?\
4 For there is mercy with thee; \* therefore shalt thou be feared.\
5 I look for the LORD; my soul doth wait for him; \* in his word is my
trust.\
6 My soul fleeth unto the Lord before the morning watch; \* I say,
before the morning watch.\
7 O Israel, trust in the LORD; for with the LORD there is mercy, \* and
with him is plenteous redemption.\
8 And he shall redeem Israel \* from all his sins.\
\
**\
Psalm 131. Domine, non est.**\
LORD, I am not high-minded; \* I have no proud looks.\
2 I do not exercise myself in great matters \* which are too high for
me.\
3 But I refrain my soul, and keep it low, like as a child that is weaned
from his mother: \* yea, my soul is even as a weaned child.\
4 O Israel, trust in the LORD \* from this time forth for evermore.\

The Twenty-eighth Day.\
\
Morning Prayer.

**Psalm 132. Memento, Domine.**\
LORD, remember David, \* and all his trouble:\
2 How he sware unto the LORD, \* and vowed a vow unto the Almighty God
of Jacob:\
3 I will not come within the tabernacle of mine house, \* nor climb up
into my bed;\
4 I will not suffer mine eyes to sleep, nor mine eyelids to slumber; \*
neither the temples of my head to take any rest;\
5 Until I find out a place for the temple of the LORD; \* an habitation
for the Mighty God of Jacob.\
6 Lo, we heard of the same at Ephratah, \* and found it in the wood.\
7 We will go into his tabernacle, \* and fall low on our knees before
his footstool.\
8 Arise, O LORD, into thy resting-place; \* thou, and the ark of thy
strength.\
9 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; \* and let thy saints
sing with joyfulness.\
10 For thy servant David\'s sake, \* turn not away the face of thine
anointed.\
11 The LORD hath made a faithful oath unto David, \* and he shall not
shrink from it:\
12 Of the fruit of thy body \* shall I set upon thy throne.\
13 If thy children will keep my covenant, and my testimonies that I
shall teach them; \* their children also shall sit upon thy throne for
evermore.\
14 For the LORD hath chosen Sion to be an habitation for himself; \* he
hath longed for her.\
15 This shall be my rest for ever: \* here will I dwell, for I have a
delight therein.\
16 I will bless her victuals with increase, \* and will satisfy her poor
with bread.\
17 I will deck her priests with health, \* and her saints shall rejoice
and sing.\
18 There shall I make the horn of David to flourish: \* I have ordained
a lantern for mine anointed.\
19 As for his enemies, I shall clothe them with shame; \* but upon
himself shall his crown flourish.\
\
**\
Psalm 133. Ecce, quam bonum!**\
BEHOLD, how good and joyful a thing it is, \* for brethren to dwell
together in unity!\
2 It is like the precious oil upon the head, that ran down unto the
beard, \* even unto Aaron\'s beard, and went down to the skirts of his
clothing.\
3 Like as the dew of Hermon, \* which fell upon the hill of Sion.\
4 For there the LORD promised his blessing, \* and life for evermore.\
\
**\
Psalm 134. Ecce nunc.**\
BEHOLD now, praise the LORD, \* all ye servants of the LORD;\
2 Ye that by night stand in the house of the LORD, \* even in the courts
of the house of our God.\
3 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, \* and praise the LORD.\
4 The LORD that made heaven and earth \* give thee blessing out of
Sion.\
\
**\
Psalm 135. Laudate Nomen.**\
O PRAISE the LORD, laud ye the Name of the LORD; \* praise it, O ye
servants of the LORD;\
2 Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, \* in the courts of the house
of our God.\
3 O praise the LORD, for the LORD is gracious; \* O sing praises unto
his Name, for it is lovely.\
4 For why? the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, \* and Israel for
his own possession.\
5 For I know that the LORD is great, \* and that our Lord is above all
gods.\
6 Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth; \*
and in the sea, and in all deep places.\
7 He bringeth forth the clouds from the ends of the world, \* and
sendeth forth lightnings with the rain, bringing the winds out of his
treasuries.\
8 He smote the firstborn of Egypt, \* both of man and beast.\
9 He hath sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O thou land of
Egypt; \* upon Pharaoh, and all his servants.\
10 He smote divers nations, \* and slew mighty kings:\
11 Sihon, king of the Amorites; and Og, the king of Bashan; \* and all
the kingdoms of Canaan;\
12 And gave their land to be an heritage, \* even an heritage unto
Israel his people.\
13 Thy Name, O LORD, endureth for ever; \* so doth thy memorial, O LORD,
from one generation to another.\
14 For the LORD will avenge his people, \* and be gracious unto his
servants.\
15 As for the images of the heathen, they are but silver and gold; \*
the work of men\'s hands.\
16 They have mouths, and speak not; \* eyes have they, but they see
not.\
17 They have ears, and yet they hear not; \* neither is there any breath
in their mouths.\
18 They that make them are like unto them; \* and so are all they that
put their trust in them.\
19 Praise the LORD, ye house of Israel; \* praise the LORD, ye house of
Aaron.\
20 Praise the LORD, ye house of Levi; \* ye that fear the LORD, praise
the LORD.\
21 Praised be the LORD out of Sion, \* who dwelleth at Jerusalem.\
\
**\

4 Who only doeth great wonders: \* for his mercy endureth for ever.\
5 Who by his excellent wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy endureth
for ever.\
6 Who laid out the earth above the waters: \* for his mercy endureth for
ever.\
7 Who hath made great lights: \* for his mercy endureth for ever:\
8 The sun to rule the day: \* for his mercy endureth for ever;\
9 The moon and the stars to govern the night: \* for his mercy endureth
for ever.\
10 Who smote Egypt, with their firstborn: \* for his mercy endureth for
ever;\
11 And brought out Israel from among them: \* for his mercy endureth for
ever;\
12 With a mighty hand and stretched-out arm: \* for his mercy endureth
for ever.\
13 Who divided the Red Sea in two parts: \* for his mercy endureth for
ever;\
14 And made Israel to go through the midst of it: \* for his mercy
endureth for ever.\
15 But as for Pharaoh and his host, he overthrew them in the Red Sea: \*
for his mercy endureth for ever.\
16 Who led his people through the wilderness: \* for his mercy endureth
for ever.\
17 Who smote great kings: \* for his mercy endureth for ever;\
18 Yea, and slew mighty kings: \* for his mercy endureth for ever:\
19 Sihon, king of the Amorites: \* for his mercy endureth for ever;\
20 And Og, the king of Bashan: \* for his mercy endureth for ever;\
21 And gave away their land for an heritage: \* for his mercy endureth
for ever;\
22 Even for an heritage unto Israel his servant: \* for his mercy
endureth for ever.\
23 Who remembered us when we were in trouble: \* for his mercy endureth
for ever;\
24 And hath delivered us from our enemies: \* for his mercy endureth for
ever.\
25 Who giveth food to all flesh: \* for his mercy endureth for ever.\
26 O give thanks unto the God of heaven: \* for his mercy endureth for
ever.\
27 O give thanks unto the Lord of lords: \* for his mercy endureth for
ever.\
\
**\
Psalm 137. Super flumina.**\
BY the waters of Babylon we sat down and wept, \* when we remembered
thee, O Sion.\
2 As for our harps, we hanged them up \* upon the trees that are
therein.\
3 For they that led us away captive, required of us then a song, and
melody in our heaviness: \* Sing us one of the songs of Sion.\
4 How shall we sing the LORD\'S song \* in a strange land?\
5 If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, \* let my right hand forget her
cunning.\
6 If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my
mouth; \* yea, if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.\
7 Remember the children of Edom, O LORD, in the day of Jerusalem; \* how
they said, Down with it, down with it, even to the ground.\
8 O daughter of Babylon, wasted with misery; \* yea, happy shall he be
that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.\
9 Blessed shall he be that taketh thy children, \* and throweth them
against the stones.\
\
**\
Psalm 138. Confitebor tibi.**\
I WILL give thanks unto thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; \* even
before the gods will I sing praise unto thee.\
2 I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy Name, because of
thy loving-kindness and truth; \* for thou hast magnified thy Name, and
thy word, above all things.\
3 When I called upon thee, thou heardest me; \* and enduedst my soul
with much strength.\
4 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD; \* for they have
heard the words of thy mouth.\
5 Yea, they shall sing of the ways of the LORD, \* that great is the
glory of the LORD.\
6 For though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly; \* as
for the proud, he beholdeth them afar off.\
7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, yet shalt thou refresh me; \*
thou shalt stretch forth thy hand upon the furiousness of mine enemies,
and thy right hand shall save me.\
8 The LORD shall make good his loving-kindness toward me; \* yea, thy
mercy, O LORD, endureth for ever; despise not then the works of thine
own hands.\
\
**\
Psalm 139. Domine, probasti.**\
O LORD, thou hast searched me out, and known me. \* Thou knowest my
down-sitting, and mine uprising; thou understandest my thoughts long
before.\
2 Thou art about my path, and about my bed; \* and art acquainted with
all my ways.\
3 For lo, there is not a word in my tongue, \* but thou, O LORD, knowest
it altogether.\
4 Thou hast beset me behind and before, \* and laid thine hand upon me.\
5 Such knowledge is too wonderful and excellent for me; \* I cannot
attain unto it.\
6 Whither shall I go then from thy Spirit? \* or whither shall I go then
from thy presence?\
7 If I climb up into heaven, thou art there; \* if I go down to hell,
thou art there also.\
8 If I take the wings of the morning, \* and remain in the uttermost
parts of the sea;\
9 Even there also shall thy hand lead me, \* and thy right hand shall
hold me.\
10 If I say, Peradventure the darkness shall cover me; \* then shall my
night be turned to day.\
11 Yea, the darkness is no darkness with thee, but the night is as clear
as the day; \* the darkness and light to thee are both alike.\
12 For my reins are thine; \* thou hast covered me in my mother\'s
womb.\
13 I will give thanks unto thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully
made: \* marvellous are thy works, and that my soul knoweth right well.\
14 My bones are not hid from thee, \* though I be made secretly, and
fashioned beneath in the earth.\
15 Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being imperfect; \* and in thy
book were all my members written;\
16 Which day by day were fashioned, \* when as yet there was none of
them.\
17 How dear are thy counsels unto me, O God; \* O how great is the sum
of them!\
18 If I tell them, they are more in number than the sand: \* when I wake
up, I am present with thee.\
19 Wilt thou not slay the wicked, O God? \* Depart from me, ye
blood-thirsty men.\
20 For they speak unrighteously against thee; \* and thine enemies take
thy Name in vain.\
21 Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? \* and am not I grieved
with those that rise up against thee?\
22 Yea, I hate them right sore; \* even as though they were mine
enemies.\
23 Try me, O God, and seek the ground of my heart; \* prove me, and
examine my thoughts.\
24 Look well if there be any way of wickedness in me; \* and lead me in
the way everlasting.\
\
**\
Psalm 140. Eripe me, Domine.**\
DELIVER me, O LORD, from the evil man; \* and preserve me from the
wicked man;\
2 Who imagine mischief in their hearts, \* and stir up strife all the
day long.\
3 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; \* adder\'s poison
is under their lips.\
4 Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the ungodly; \* preserve me from
the wicked men, who are purposed to overthrow my goings.\
5 The proud have laid a snare for me, and spread a net abroad with
cords; \* yea, and set traps in my way.\
6 I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God, \* hear the voice of my
prayers, O LORD.\
7 O LORD God, thou strength of my health; \* thou hast covered my head
in the day of battle.\
8 Let not the ungodly have his desire, O LORD; \* let not his
mischievous imagination prosper, lest they be too proud.\
9 Let the mischief of their own lips fall upon the head of them \* that
compass me about.\
10 Let hot burning coals fall upon them; \* let them be cast into the
fire, and into the pit, that they never rise up again.\
11 A man full of words shall not prosper upon the earth: \* evil shall
hunt the wicked person to overthrow him.\
12 Sure I am that the LORD will avenge the poor, \* and maintain the
cause of the helpless.\
13 The righteous also shall give thanks unto thy Name; \* and the just
shall continue in thy sight.\
\
**\
Psalm 141. Domine, clamavi.**\
LORD, I call upon thee; haste thee unto me, \* and consider my voice,
when I cry unto thee.\
2 Let my prayer be set forth in thy sight as the incense; \* and let the
lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice.\
3 Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth, \* and keep the door of my
lips.\
4 O let not mine heart be inclined to any evil thing; \* let me not be
occupied in ungodly works with the men that work wickedness, neither let
me eat of such things as please them.\
5 Let the righteous rather smite me friendly, and reprove me; \* yea,
let not my head refuse their precious balms.\
6 As for the ungodly, \* I will pray yet against their wickedness.\
7 Let their judges be overthrown in stony places, \* that they may hear
my words; for they are sweet.\
8 Our bones lie scattered before the pit, \* like as when one breaketh
and heweth wood upon the earth.\
9 But mine eyes look unto thee, O LORD God; \* in thee is my trust; O
cast not out my soul.\
10 Keep me from the snare that they have laid for me, \* and from the
traps of the wicked doers.\
11 Let the ungodly fall into their own nets together, \* and let me ever
escape them.\
\
**\
Psalm 142. Voce mea ad Dominum.**\
I CRIED unto the LORD with my voice; \* yea, even unto the LORD did I
make my supplication.\
2 I poured out my complaints before him, \* and showed him of my
trouble.\
3 When my spirit was in heaviness, thou knewest my path; \* in the way
wherein I walked, have they privily laid a snare for me.\
4 I looked also upon my right hand, \* and saw there was no man that
would know me.\
5 I had no place to flee unto, \* and no man cared for my soul.\
6 I cried unto thee, O LORD, and said, \* Thou art my hope, and my
portion in the land of the living.\
7 Consider my complaint; \* for I am brought very low.\
8 O deliver me from my persecutors; \* for they are too strong for me.\
9 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks unto thy Name; \*
which thing if thou wilt grant me, then shall the righteous resort unto
my company.\
\
**\
Psalm 143. Domine, exaudi.**\
HEAR my prayer, O LORD, and consider my desire; \* hearken unto me for
thy truth and righteousness\' sake.\
2 And enter not into judgment with thy servant; \* for in thy sight
shall no man living be justified.\
3 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to
the ground; \* he hath laid me in the darkness, as the men that have
been long dead.\
4 Therefore is my spirit vexed within me, \* and my heart within me is
desolate.\
5 Yet do I remember the time past; I muse upon all thy works; \* yea, I
exercise myself in the works of thy hands.\
6 I stretch forth my hands unto thee; \* my soul gaspeth unto thee as a
thirsty land.\
7 Hear me, O LORD, and that soon; for my spirit waxeth faint: \* hide
not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the
pit.\
8 O let me hear thy loving-kindness betimes in the morning; for in thee
is my trust: \* show thou me the way that I should walk in; for I lift
up my soul unto thee.\
9 Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies; \* for I flee unto thee to hide
me.\
10 Teach me to do the thing that pleaseth thee; for thou art my God: \*
let thy loving Spirit lead me forth into the land of righteousness.\
11 Quicken me, O LORD, for thy Name\'s sake; \* and for thy
righteousness\' sake bring my soul out of trouble.\
12 And of thy goodness slay mine enemies, \* and destroy all them that
vex my soul; for I am thy servant.\
\
**\
Psalm 144. Benedictus Dominus.**\
BLESSED be the LORD my strength, \* who teacheth my hands to war, and my
fingers to fight:\
2 My hope and my fortress, my castle and deliverer, my defender in whom
I trust; \* who subdueth my people that is under me.\
3 LORD, what is man, that thou hast such respect unto him? \* or the son
of man, that thou so regardest him?\
4 Man is like a thing of nought; \* his time passeth away like a
shadow.\
5 Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down; \* touch the mountains, and
they shall smoke.\
6 Cast forth thy lightning, and tear them; \* shoot out thine arrows,
and consume them.\
7 Send down thine hand from above; \* deliver me, and take me out of the
great waters, from the hand of strangers;\
8 Whose mouth talketh of vanity, \* and their right hand is a right hand
of wickedness.\
9 I will sing a new song unto thee, O God; \* and sing praises unto thee
upon a ten-stringed lute.\
10 Thou hast given victory unto kings, \* and hast delivered David thy
servant from the peril of the sword.\
11 Save me, and deliver me from the hand of strangers, \* whose mouth
talketh of vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of iniquity:\
12 That our sons may grow up as the young plants, \* and that our
daughters may be as the polished corners of the temple;\
13 That our garners may be full and plenteous with all manner of store;
\* that our sheep may bring forth thousands, and ten thousands in our
fields;\
14 That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no decay, \* no
leading into captivity, and no complaining in our streets.\
15 Happy are the people that are in such a case; \* yea, blessed are the
people who have the LORD for their God.\
**\
\
Psalm 145. Exaltabo te, Deus.**\
I WILL magnify thee, O God, my King; \* and I will praise thy Name for
ever and ever.\
2 Every day will I give thanks unto thee; \* and praise thy Name for
ever and ever.\
3 Great is the LORD, and marvellous worthy to be praised; \* there is no
end of his greatness.\
4 One generation shall praise thy works unto another, \* and declare thy
power.\
5 As for me, I will be talking of thy worship, \* thy glory, thy praise,
and wondrous works;\
6 So that men shall speak of the might of thy marvellous acts; \* and I
will also tell of thy greatness.\
7 The memorial of thine abundant kindness shall be showed; \* and men
shall sing of thy righteousness.\
8 The LORD is gracious and merciful; \* long-suffering, and of great
goodness.\
9 The LORD is loving unto every man; \* and his mercy is over all his
works.\
10 All thy works praise thee, O LORD; \* and thy saints give thanks unto
thee.\
11 They show the glory of thy kingdom, \* and talk of thy power;\
12 That thy power, thy glory, and mightiness of thy kingdom, \* might be
known unto men.\
13 Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, \* and thy dominion endureth
throughout all ages.\
14 The LORD upholdeth all such as fall, \* and lifteth up all those that
are down.\
15 The eyes of all wait upon thee, O Lord; \* and thou givest them their
meat in due season.\
16 Thou openest thine hand, \* and fillest all things living with
plenteousness.\
17 The LORD is righteous in all his ways, \* and holy in all his works.\
18 The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him; \* yea, all such
as call upon him faithfully.\
19 He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him; \* he also will hear
their cry, and will help them.\
20 The LORD preserveth all them that love him; \* but scattereth abroad
all the ungodly.\
21 My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD; \* and let all flesh
give thanks unto his holy Name for ever and ever.\
\
**\
Psalm 146. Lauda, anima mea.**\
PRAISE the LORD, O my soul: while I live, will I praise the LORD; \*
yea, as long as I have any being, I will sing praises unto my God.\
2 O put not your trust in princes, nor in any child of man; \* for there
is no help in them.\
3 For when the breath of man goeth forth, he shall turn again to his
earth, \* and then all his thoughts perish.\
4 Blessed is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, \* and whose
hope is in the LORD his God:\
5 Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that therein is; \* who
keepeth his promise for ever;\
6 Who helpeth them to right that suffer wrong; \* who feedeth the
hungry.\
7 The LORD looseth men out of prison; \* the LORD giveth sight to the
blind.\
8 The LORD helpeth them that are fallen; \* the LORD careth for the
righteous.\
9 The LORD careth for the strangers; he defendeth the fatherless and
widow: \* as for the way of the ungodly, he turneth it upside down.\
10 The LORD thy God, O Sion, shall be King for evermore, \* and
throughout all generations.\
\
**\
Psalm 147. Laudate Dominum.**\
PRAISE the LORD, for it is a good thing to sing praises unto our God; \*
yea, a joyful and pleasant thing it is to be thankful.\
2 The LORD doth build up Jerusalem, \* and gather together the outcasts
of Israel.\
3 He healeth those that are broken in heart, \* and giveth medicine to
heal their sickness.\
4 He telleth the number of the stars, \* and calleth them all by their
names.\
5 Great is our Lord, and great is his power; \* yea, and his wisdom is
infinite.\
6 The LORD setteth up the meek, \* and bringeth the ungodly down to the
ground.\
7 O sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; \* sing praises upon the harp
unto our God:\
8 Who covereth the heaven with clouds, and prepareth rain for the earth;
\* and maketh the grass to grow upon the mountains, and herb for the use
of men;\
9 Who giveth fodder unto the cattle, \* and feedeth the young ravens
that call upon him.\
10 He hath no pleasure in the strength of an horse; \* neither
delighteth he in any man\'s legs.\
11 But the LORD\'S delight is in them that fear him, \* and put their
trust in his mercy. \~\
12 Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; \* praise thy God, O Sion.\
13 For he hath made fast the bars of thy gates, \* and hath blessed thy
children within thee.\
14 He maketh peace in thy borders, \* and filleth thee with the flour of
wheat.\
15 He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth, \* and his word runneth
very swiftly.\
16 He giveth snow like wool, \* and scattereth the hoarfrost like
ashes.\
17 He casteth forth his ice like morsels: \* who is able to abide his
frost?\
18 He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: \* he bloweth with his
wind, and the waters flow.\
19 He showeth his word unto Jacob, \* his statutes and ordinances unto
Israel.\
20 He hath not dealt so with any nation; \* neither have the heathen
knowledge of his laws.\
\
**\
Psalm 148. Laudate Dominum.**\
O PRAISE the LORD from the heavens: \* praise him in the heights.\
2 Praise him, all ye angels of his: \* praise him, all his host.\
3 Praise him, sun and moon: \* praise him, all ye stars and light.\
4 Praise him, all ye heavens, \* and ye waters that are above the
heavens.\
5 Let them praise the Name of the LORD: \* for he spake the word, and
they were made; he commanded, and they were created.\
6 He hath made them fast for ever and ever: \* he hath given them a law
which shall not be broken.\
7 Praise the LORD from the earth, \* ye dragons and all deeps;\
8 Fire and hail, snow and vapours, \* wind and storm, fulfilling his
word;\
9 Mountains and all hills; \* fruitful trees and all cedars;\
10 Beasts and all cattle; \* creeping things and flying fowls;\
11 Kings of the earth, and all peoples; \* princes, and all judges of
the world;\
12 Young men and maidens, old men and children, praise the Name of the
LORD: \* for his Name only is excellent, and his praise above heaven and
earth.\
13 He shall exalt the horn of his people: all his saints shall praise
him; \* even the children of Israel, even the people that serveth him.\
\
**\
Psalm 149. Cantate Domino.**\
O SING unto the LORD a new song; \* let the congregation of saints
praise him.\
2 Let Israel rejoice in him that made him, \* and let the children of
Sion be joyful in their King.\
3 Let them praise his Name in the dance: \* let them sing praises unto
him with tabret and harp.\
4 For the LORD hath pleasure in his people, \* and helpeth the
meek-hearted.\
5 Let the saints be joyful with glory; \* let them rejoice in their
beds.\
6 Let the praises of God be in their mouth; \* and a two-edged sword in
their hands;\
7 To be avenged of the nations, \* and to rebuke the peoples;\
8 To bind their kings in chains, \* and their nobles with links of
iron;\
9 To execute judgment upon them; as it is written, \* Such honour have
all his saints.\
\
**\
Psalm 150. Laudate Dominum.**\
O PRAISE God in his sanctuary: \* praise him in the firmament of his
power.\
2 Praise him in his noble acts: \* praise him according to his excellent
greatness.\
3 Praise him in the sound of the trumpet: \* praise him upon the lute
and harp.\
4 Praise him in the timbrels and dances: \* praise him upon the strings
and pipe.\
5 Praise him upon the well-tuned cymbals: \* praise him upon the loud
cymbals.\
6 Let every thing that hath breath \* praise the LORD.\
