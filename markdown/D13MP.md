**Psalm 68. Exsurgat Deus.**\
LET God arise, and let his enemies be scattered; \* let them also that
hate him flee before him.\
2 Like as the smoke vanisheth, so shalt thou drive them away; \* and
like as wax melteth at the fire, so let the ungodly perish at the
presence of God.\
3 But let the righteous be glad, and rejoice before God; \* let them
also be merry and joyful.\
4 O sing unto God, and sing praises unto his Name; magnify him that
rideth upon the heavens; \* praise him in his Name JAH, and rejoice
before him.\
5 He is a Father of the fatherless, and defendeth the cause of the
widows; \* even God in his holy habitation.\
6 He is the God that maketh men to be of one mind in an house, and
bringeth the prisoners out of captivity; \* but letteth the runagates
continue in scarceness.\
7 O God, when thou wentest forth before the people; \* when thou wentest
through the wilderness,\
8 The earth shook, and the heavens dropped at the presence of God; \*
even as Sinai also was moved at the presence of God, who is the God of
Israel.\
9 Thou, O God, sentest a gracious rain upon thine inheritance, \* and
refreshedst it when it was weary.\
10 Thy congregation shall dwell therein; \* for thou, O God, hast of thy
goodness prepared for the poor.\
11 The Lord gave the word; \* great was the company of women that bare
the tidings.\
12 Kings with their armies did flee, and were discomfited, \* and they
of the household divided the spoil.\
13 Though ye have lain among the sheep-folds, yet shall ye be as the
wings of a dove \* that is covered with silver wings, and her feathers
like gold.\
14 When the Almighty scattered kings for their sake, \* then were they
as white as snow in Salmon.\
15 As the hill of Bashan, so is God\'s hill; \* even an high hill, as
the hill of Bashan.\
16 Why mock ye so, ye high hills? this is God\'s hill, in the which it
pleaseth him to dwell; \* yea, the LORD will abide in it for ever.\
17 The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels; \*
and the Lord is among them as in the holy place of Sinai.\
18 Thou art gone up on high, thou hast led captivity captive, and
received gifts from men; \* yea, even from thine enemies, that the LORD
God might dwell among them.\
19 Praised be the Lord daily, \* even the God who helpeth us, and
poureth his benefits upon us.\
20 He is our God, even the God of whom cometh salvation: \* GOD is the
Lord, by whom we escape death.\
21 God shall wound the head of his enemies, \* and the hairy scalp of
such a one as goeth on still in his wickedness.\
22 The Lord hath said, I will bring my people again, as I did from
Bashan; \* mine own will I bring again, as I did sometime from the deep
of the sea.\
23 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, \* and
that the tongue of thy dogs may be red through the same.\
24 It is well seen, O God, how thou goest; \* how thou, my God and King,
goest in the sanctuary.\
25 The singers go before, the minstrels follow after, \* in the midst of
the damsels playing with the timbrels.\
26 Give thanks unto God the Lord in the congregation, \* ye that are of
the fountain of Israel.\
27 There is little Benjamin their ruler, and the princes of Judah their
council; \* the princes of Zebulon, and the princes of Naphthali.\
28 Thy God hath sent forth strength for thee; \* stablish the thing, O
God, that thou hast wrought in us,\
29 For thy temple\'s sake at Jerusalem; \* so shall kings bring presents
unto thee.\
30 Rebuke thou the dragon and the bull, with the leaders of the heathen,
so that they humbly bring pieces of silver; \* scatter thou the peoples
that delight in war;\
31 Then shall the princes come out of Egypt; \* the Morians\' land shall
soon stretch out her hands unto God.\
32 Sing unto God, O ye kingdoms of the earth; \* O sing praises unto the
Lord;\
33 Who sitteth in the heavens over all, from the beginning: \* lo, he
doth send out his voice; yea, and that a mighty voice.\
34 Ascribe ye the power to God over Israel; \* his worship and strength
is in the clouds.\
35 O God, wonderful art thou in thy holy places: \* even the God of
Israel, he will give strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God.
