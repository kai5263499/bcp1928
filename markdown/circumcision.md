The Collect.

![ded](http://stats.superstats.com/b/ss/DAVIDMCMANNES/1){border="0"}

ALMIGHTY God, who madest thy blessed Son to be circumcised, and obedient
to the law for man; Grant us the true circumcision of the Spirit; that,
our hearts, and all our members, being mortified from all worldly and
carnal lusts, we may in all things obey thy blessed will; through the
same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\

The Epistle. Philippians ii. 9.

GOD also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above
every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things
in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that
every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of
God the Father. Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as
in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own
salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you
both to will and to do of his good pleasure.\

The Gospel. St. Luke ii. 15.

AND it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven,
the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem,
and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known
unto us. And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the
babe lying in a manger. And when they had seen it, they made known
abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child. And all
they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the
shepherds. But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her
heart. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all
the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them. And
when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his
name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was
conceived in the womb.
