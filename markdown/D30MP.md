**Psalm 144. Benedictus Dominus.**\
BLESSED be the LORD my strength, \* who teacheth my hands to war, and my
fingers to fight:\
2 My hope and my fortress, my castle and deliverer, my defender in whom
I trust; \* who subdueth my people that is under me.\
3 LORD, what is man, that thou hast such respect unto him? \* or the son
of man, that thou so regardest him?\
4 Man is like a thing of nought; \* his time passeth away like a
shadow.\
5 Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down; \* touch the mountains, and
they shall smoke.\
6 Cast forth thy lightning, and tear them; \* shoot out thine arrows,
and consume them.\
7 Send down thine hand from above; \* deliver me, and take me out of the
great waters, from the hand of strangers;\
8 Whose mouth talketh of vanity, \* and their right hand is a right hand
of wickedness.\
9 I will sing a new song unto thee, O God; \* and sing praises unto thee
upon a ten-stringed lute.\
10 Thou hast given victory unto kings, \* and hast delivered David thy
servant from the peril of the sword.\
11 Save me, and deliver me from the hand of strangers, \* whose mouth
talketh of vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of iniquity:\
12 That our sons may grow up as the young plants, \* and that our
daughters may be as the polished corners of the temple;\
13 That our garners may be full and plenteous with all manner of store;
\* that our sheep may bring forth thousands, and ten thousands in our
fields;\
14 That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no decay, \* no
leading into captivity, and no complaining in our streets.\
15 Happy are the people that are in such a case; \* yea, blessed are the
people who have the LORD for their God.\

**Psalm 145. Exaltabo te, Deus.**\
I WILL magnify thee, O God, my King; \* and I will praise thy Name for
ever and ever.\
2 Every day will I give thanks unto thee; \* and praise thy Name for
ever and ever.\
3 Great is the LORD, and marvellous worthy to be praised; \* there is no
end of his greatness.\
4 One generation shall praise thy works unto another, \* and declare thy
power.\
5 As for me, I will be talking of thy worship, \* thy glory, thy praise,
and wondrous works;\
6 So that men shall speak of the might of thy marvellous acts; \* and I
will also tell of thy greatness.\
7 The memorial of thine abundant kindness shall be showed; \* and men
shall sing of thy righteousness.\
8 The LORD is gracious and merciful; \* long-suffering, and of great
goodness.\
9 The LORD is loving unto every man; \* and his mercy is over all his
works.\
10 All thy works praise thee, O LORD; \* and thy saints give thanks unto
thee.\
11 They show the glory of thy kingdom, \* and talk of thy power;\
12 That thy power, thy glory, and mightiness of thy kingdom, \* might be
known unto men.\
13 Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, \* and thy dominion endureth
throughout all ages.\
14 The LORD upholdeth all such as fall, \* and lifteth up all those that
are down.\
15 The eyes of all wait upon thee, O Lord; \* and thou givest them their
meat in due season.\
16 Thou openest thine hand, \* and fillest all things living with
plenteousness.\
17 The LORD is righteous in all his ways, \* and holy in all his works.\
18 The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him; \* yea, all such
as call upon him faithfully.\
19 He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him; \* he also will hear
their cry, and will help them.\
20 The LORD preserveth all them that love him; \* but scattereth abroad
all the ungodly.\
21 My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD; \* and let all flesh
give thanks unto his holy Name for ever and ever.\

**Psalm 146. Lauda, anima mea.**\
PRAISE the LORD, O my soul: while I live, will I praise the LORD; \*
yea, as long as I have any being, I will sing praises unto my God.\
2 O put not your trust in princes, nor in any child of man; \* for there
is no help in them.\
3 For when the breath of man goeth forth, he shall turn again to his
earth, \* and then all his thoughts perish.\
4 Blessed is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, \* and whose
hope is in the LORD his God:\
5 Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that therein is; \* who
keepeth his promise for ever;\
6 Who helpeth them to right that suffer wrong; \* who feedeth the
hungry.\
7 The LORD looseth men out of prison; \* the LORD giveth sight to the
blind.\
8 The LORD helpeth them that are fallen; \* the LORD careth for the
righteous.\
9 The LORD careth for the strangers; he defendeth the fatherless and
widow: \* as for the way of the ungodly, he turneth it upside down.\
10 The LORD thy God, O Sion, shall be King for evermore, \* and
throughout all generations.
