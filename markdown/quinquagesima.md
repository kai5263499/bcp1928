| Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:\                         |

| day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.\          |

| 6 For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his       |
| throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with           |
| sackcloth, and sat in ashes.\                                         |
| 7 And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by  |
| the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor    |
| beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink  |
| water:\                                                               |

| the violence that is in their hands.\                                 |

| fierce anger, that we perish not?\                                    |
| 10 And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and |
| God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto      |

| this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before |
| unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, |

| till he might see what would become of the city.\                     |
| 6 And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over      |
| Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from   |
| his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.\                 |
| 7 But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it  |
| smote the gourd that it withered.\                                    |
| 8 And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a    |
| vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he  |
| fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me  |
| to die than to live.\                                                 |

| And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.\                 |
| 10 Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which |
| thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a    |
| night, and perished in a night:\                                      |

| out, and entreated him.\                                              |
| 29 And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I     |

| 30 But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy      |
| living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.\       |
| 31 And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I   |
| have is thine.\                                                       |

| it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the      |
| child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and       |
| wept.\                                                                |

| 7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden        |
| wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:\          |
| 8 Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known    |
| it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.\                 |
| 9 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither     |
| have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath         |
| prepared for them that love him.\                                     |
| 10 But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit   |
| searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.\                   |
| 11 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man   |
| which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the    |
| Spirit of God.\                                                       |
| []{#anchor357317}12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the       |
| world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things  |
| that are freely given to us of God.\                                  |
| 13 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man\'s wisdom   |
| teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual      |
| things with spiritual.\                                               |
| 14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: |
| for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because  |
| they are spiritually discerned.\                                      |
| 15 But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is     |
| judged of no man.\                                                    |
| 16 For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? |
| But we have the mind of Christ.\                                      |
