| **Psalm 63. Deus, Deus meus.**\                                       |
| O GOD, thou art my God; \* early will I seek thee.\                   |
| 2 My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh also longeth after thee, \* in |
| a barren and dry land where no water is.\                             |
| 3 Thus have I looked for thee in the sanctuary, \* that I might       |
| behold thy power and glory.\                                          |
| 4 For thy loving-kindness is better than the life itself: \* my lips  |
| shall praise thee.\                                                   |
| 5 As long as I live will I magnify thee in this manner, \* and lift   |
| up my hands in thy Name.\                                             |
| 6 My soul shall be satisfied, even as it were with marrow and         |
| fatness, \* when my mouth praiseth thee with joyful lips.\            |
| 7 Have I not remembered thee in my bed, \* and thought upon thee when |
| I was waking?\                                                        |
| 8 Because thou hast been my helper; \* therefore under the shadow of  |
| thy wings will I rejoice.\                                            |
| 9 My soul hangeth upon thee; \* thy right hand hath upholden me.\     |
| 10 These also that seek the hurt of my soul, \* they shall go under   |
| the earth.\                                                           |
| 11 Let them fall upon the edge of the sword, \* that they may be a    |
| portion for foxes.\                                                   |
| 12 But the King shall rejoice in God; all they also that swear by him |
| shall be commended; \* for the mouth of them that speak lies shall be |
| stopped.                                                              |
