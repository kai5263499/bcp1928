**Psalm 119. (Cont)\
V. Legem pone.**\
TEACH me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes, \* and I shall keep it unto
the end.\
34 Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; \* yea, I shall keep
it with my whole heart.\
35 Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; \* for therein is my
desire.\
36 Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, \* and not to covetousness.\
37 O turn away mine eyes, lest they behold vanity; \* and quicken thou
me in thy way.\
38 O stablish thy word in thy servant, \* that I may fear thee.\
39 Take away the rebuke that I am afraid of; \* for thy judgments are
good.\
40 Behold, my delight is in thy commandments; \* O quicken me in thy
righteousness.\

**VI. Et veniat super me.**\
LET thy loving mercy come also unto me, O LORD, \* even thy salvation,
according unto thy word.\
42 So shall I make answer unto my blasphemers; \* for my trust is in thy
word.\
43 O take not the word of thy truth utterly out of my mouth; \* for my
hope is in thy judgments.\
44 So shall I alway keep thy law; \* yea, for ever and ever.\
45 And I will walk at liberty; \* for I seek thy commandments.\
46 I will speak of thy testimonies also, even before kings, \* and will
not be ashamed.\
47 And my delight shall be in thy commandments, \* which I have loved.\
48 My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have
loved; \* and my study shall be in thy statutes.\

**VII. Memor esto verbi tui.**\
O THINK upon thy servant, as concerning thy word, \* wherein thou hast
caused me to put my trust.\
50 The same is my comfort in my trouble; \* for thy word hath quickened
me.\
51 The proud have had me exceedingly in derision; \* yet have I not
shrinked from thy law.\
52 For I remembered thine everlasting judgments, O LORD, \* and received
comfort.\
53 I am horribly afraid, \* for the ungodly that forsake thy law.\
54 Thy statutes have been my songs, \* in the house of my pilgrimage.\
55 I have thought upon thy Name, O LORD, in the night season, \* and
have kept thy law.\
56 This I had, \* because I kept thy commandments.\

**VIII. Portio mea, Domine.**\
THOU art my portion, O LORD; \* I have promised to keep thy law.\
58 I made my humble petition in thy presence with my whole heart; \* O
be merciful unto me, according to thy word.\
59 I called mine own ways to remembrance, \* and turned my feet unto thy
testimonies.\
60 I made haste, and prolonged not the time, \* to keep thy
commandments.\
61 The snares of the ungodly have compassed me about; \* but I have not
forgotten thy law.\
62 At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee, \* because of thy
righteous judgments.\
63 I am a companion of all them that fear thee, \* and keep thy
commandments.\
64 The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: \* O teach me thy statutes.\

**IX. Bonitatem fecisti.**\
O LORD, thou hast dealt graciously with thy servant, \* according unto
thy word.\
66 O teach me true understanding and knowledge; \* for I have believed
thy commandments.\
67 Before I was troubled, I went wrong; \* but now have I kept thy
word.\
68 Thou art good and gracious; \* O teach me thy statutes.\
69 The proud have imagined a lie against me; \* but I will keep thy
commandments with my whole heart.\
70 Their heart is as fat as brawn; \* but my delight hath been in thy
law.\
71 It is good for me that I have been in trouble; \* that I may learn
thy statutes.\
72 The law of thy mouth is dearer unto me \* than thousands of gold and
silver.
