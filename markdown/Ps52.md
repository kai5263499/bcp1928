| \                                                                     |

| **Psalm 52. Quid gloriaris?**\                                        |
| WHY boastest thou thyself, thou tyrant, \* that thou canst do         |
| mischief;\                                                            |
| 2 Whereas the goodness of God \* endureth yet daily?\                 |
| 3 Thy tongue imagineth wickedness, \* and with lies thou cuttest like |
| a sharp razor.\                                                       |
| 4 Thou hast loved unrighteousness more than goodness, \* and          |
| falsehood more than righteousness.\                                   |
| 5 Thou hast loved to speak all words that may do hurt, \* O thou      |
| false tongue.\                                                        |
| 6 Therefore shall God destroy thee for ever; \* he shall take thee,   |
| and pluck thee out of thy dwelling, and root thee out of the land of  |
| the living.\                                                          |
| 7 The righteous also shall see this, and fear, \* and shall laugh him |
| to scorn:\                                                            |
| 8 Lo, this is the man that took not God for his strength; \* but      |
| trusted unto the multitude of his riches, and strengthened himself in |
| his wickedness.\                                                      |
| 9 As for me, I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God; \* my  |
| trust is in the tender mercy of God for ever and ever.\               |
| 10 I will alway give thanks unto thee for that thou hast done; \* and |
| I will hope in thy Name, for thy saints like it well.                 |
