| O ETERNAL God, we humbly beseech thee, favourably to behold these thy |
| servants now (or about to be) joined in wedlock according to thy holy |
| ordinance; and grant that they, seeking first thy kingdom and thy     |
| righteousness, may obtain the manifold blessings of thy grace;        |
| through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\                                 |
|                                                                       |
| The Epistle. Ephesians v. 20.                                         |
|                                                                       |
| GIVE thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name |
| of our Lord Jesus Christ; submitting yourselves one to another in the |
| fear of God. Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto |
| the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is  |
| the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. Therefore  |
| as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their    |
| own husbands in every thing. Husbands, love your wives, even as       |
| Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; that he might  |
| sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that   |
| he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or |
| wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without    |
| blemish. So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He     |
| that loveth his wife loveth himself. For no man ever yet hated his    |
| own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the     |
| church: for we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his      |
| bones. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and    |
| shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. This  |
| is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.     |
| Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even |
| as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.\         |

| The Gospel. St. Matthew xix. 4.                                       |
|                                                                       |
| JESUS answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which    |
| made them at the beginning made them male and female, and said, For   |
| this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to   |
| his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no    |
| more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together,   |
| let not man put asunder.                                              |
