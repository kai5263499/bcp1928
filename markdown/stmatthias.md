| O ALMIGHTY God, who into the place of the traitor Judas didst choose  |

| Apostles; Grant that thy Church, being alway preserved from false     |

|                                                                       |
| For the Epistle. Acts i. 15.                                          |
|                                                                       |
| IN those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, |
| (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,) Men  |
| and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which    |
| the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas,   |
| which was guide to them that took Jesus. For he was numbered with us, |
| and had obtained part of this ministry. Now this man purchased a      |
| field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst     |
| asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out. And it was known |
| unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called  |
| in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. |
| For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be        |
| desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let        |
| another take. Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all |
| the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, beginning from |
| the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, |
| must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection. And |
| they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus,  |
| and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest    |
| the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,    |
| that he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which    |
| Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And   |
| they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he    |
| was numbered with the eleven apostles.\                               |
|                                                                       |
| The Gospel. St. Matthew xi. 25.                                       |
|                                                                       |
| AT that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of |
| heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise    |
| and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father: for  |
| so it seemed good in thy sight. All things are delivered unto me of   |
| my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither        |
| knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the    |
| Son will reveal him. Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy   |
| laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of  |
| me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto     |
| your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.              |
|                                                                       |
