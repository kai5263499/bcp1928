Evening Prayer.\
Psalm 98. Cantate Domino.\
O SING unto the LORD a new song; \* for he hath done marvellous things.\
2 With his own right hand, and with his holy arm, \* hath he gotten
himself the victory.\
3 The LORD declared his salvation; \* his righteousness hath he openly
showed in the sight of the heathen.\
4 He hath remembered his mercy and truth toward the house of Israel; \*
and all the ends of the world have seen the salvation of our God.\
5 Show yourselves joyful unto the LORD, all ye lands; \* sing, rejoice,
and give thanks.\
6 Praise the LORD upon the harp; \* sing to the harp with a psalm of
thanksgiving.\
7 With trumpets also and shawms, \* O show yourselves joyful before the
LORD, the King.\
8 Let the sea make a noise, and all that therein is; \* the round world,
and they that dwell therein.\
9 Let the floods clap their hands, and let the hills be joyful together
before the LORD; \* for he is come to judge the earth.\
10 With righteousness shall he judge the world, \* and the peoples with
equity.\

Psalm 99. Dominus regnavit.\
THE LORD is King, be the people never so impatient; \* he sitteth
between the Cherubim, be the earth never so unquiet.\
2 The LORD is great in Sion, \* and high above all people.\
3 They shall give thanks unto thy Name, \* which is great, wonderful,
and holy.\
4 The King\'s power loveth judgment; thou hast prepared equity, \* thou
hast executed judgment and righteousness in Jacob.\
5 O magnify the LORD our God, and fall down before his footstool; \* for
he is holy.\
6 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among such as call upon
his Name: \* these called upon the LORD, and he heard them.\
7 He spake unto them out of the cloudy pillar; \* for they kept his
testimonies, and the law that he gave them.\
8 Thou heardest them, O LORD our God; \* thou forgavest them, O God,
though thou didst punish their wicked doings.\
9 O magnify the LORD our God, and worship him upon his holy hill; \* for
the LORD our God is holy.\

Psalm 100. Jubilate Deo.\
O BE joyful in the LORD, all ye lands: \* serve the LORD with gladness,
and come before his presence with a song.\
2 Be ye sure that the LORD he is God; it is he that hath made us, and
not we ourselves; \* we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.\
3 O go your way into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts
with praise; \* be thankful unto him, and speak good of his Name.\
4 For the LORD is gracious, his mercy is everlasting; \* and his truth
endureth from generation to generation.\

Psalm 101. Misericordiam et judicium.\
MY song shall be of mercy and judgment; \* unto thee, O LORD, will I
sing.\
2 O let me have understanding \* in the way of godliness!\
3 When wilt thou come unto me? \* I will walk in my house with a perfect
heart.\
4 I will take no wicked thing in hand; I hate the sins of
unfaithfulness; \* there shall no such cleave unto me.\
5 A froward heart shall depart from me; \* I will not know a wicked
person.\
6 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, \* him will I destroy.\
7 Whoso hath also a haughty look and a proud heart, \* I will not suffer
him.\
8 Mine eyes look upon such as are faithful in the land, \* that they may
dwell with me.\
9 Whoso leadeth a godly life, \* he shall be my servant.\
10 There shall no deceitful person dwell in my house; \* he that telleth
lies shall not tarry in my sight.\
11 I shall soon destroy all the ungodly that are in the land; \* that I
may root out all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.
