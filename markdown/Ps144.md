| **Psalm 144. Benedictus Dominus.**\                                   |
| BLESSED be the LORD my strength, \* who teacheth my hands to war, and |
| my fingers to fight:\                                                 |
| 2 My hope and my fortress, my castle and deliverer, my defender in    |
| whom I trust; \* who subdueth my people that is under me.\            |
| 3 LORD, what is man, that thou hast such respect unto him? \* or the  |
| son of man, that thou so regardest him?\                              |
| 4 Man is like a thing of nought; \* his time passeth away like a      |
| shadow.\                                                              |
| 5 Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down; \* touch the mountains, and |
| they shall smoke.\                                                    |
| 6 Cast forth thy lightning, and tear them; \* shoot out thine arrows, |
| and consume them.\                                                    |
| 7 Send down thine hand from above; \* deliver me, and take me out of  |
| the great waters, from the hand of strangers;\                        |
| 8 Whose mouth talketh of vanity, \* and their right hand is a right   |
| hand of wickedness.\                                                  |
| 9 I will sing a new song unto thee, O God; \* and sing praises unto   |
| thee upon a ten-stringed lute.\                                       |
| 10 Thou hast given victory unto kings, \* and hast delivered David    |
| thy servant from the peril of the sword.\                             |
| 11 Save me, and deliver me from the hand of strangers, \* whose mouth |
| talketh of vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of iniquity:\ |
| 12 That our sons may grow up as the young plants, \* and that our     |
| daughters may be as the polished corners of the temple;\              |
| 13 That our garners may be full and plenteous with all manner of      |
| store; \* that our sheep may bring forth thousands, and ten thousands |
| in our fields;\                                                       |
| 14 That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no decay, \*  |
| no leading into captivity, and no complaining in our streets.\        |
| 15 Happy are the people that are in such a case; \* yea, blessed are  |
| the people who have the LORD for their God.                           |
