| 12 The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little or    |
| much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.\    |
| 13 There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely,      |
| riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.\                    |

| should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?\                           |
| 35 I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good  |
| and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I     |
| hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore   |
| then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?\       |
| 36 Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and    |
| why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?\             |
| 37 Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in   |
| mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my      |
| mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord  |

| that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which     |
| think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.\                  |
| 3 For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:\    |
| 4 (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through  |
| God to the pulling down of strong holds;)\                            |
| 5 Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth       |
| itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity      |
| every thought to the obedience of Christ;\                            |

| obedience is fulfilled.\                                              |

| to himself that he is Christ\'s, let him of himself think this again, |
| that, as he is Christ\'s, even so are we Christ\'s.\                  |
| 8 For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the |
| Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I   |
| should not be ashamed:\                                               |
| 9 That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.\          |
| 10 For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his       |
| bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.\                |
| 11 Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by        |
| letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are  |
| present.\                                                             |
| 12 For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves |
| with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by   |
| themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.\ |
| 13 But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according |
| to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a        |
| measure to reach even unto you.\                                      |
| 14 For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we      |
| reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in        |
| preaching the gospel of Christ:\                                      |
| 15 Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other      |
| men\'s labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that   |
| we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,\        |

| in another man\'s line of things made ready to our hand.\             |

| 8 These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite |

| the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew  |

| three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that    |
| were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were    |
| gone away:\                                                           |
| 10 He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and  |
| his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory   |
| that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.\           |
| 11 And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the    |
| Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of |
| ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines.\   |
| 12 But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew |
| the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.\               |
| 13 And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the  |
| harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the           |
| Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.\                        |

| 16 And the three mighty men brake through the host of the             |

| Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being   |
| burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself.\                      |

| 1 And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he  |
| moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.\        |
| 10 And David\'s heart smote him after that he had numbered the        |
| people. And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I |
| have done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of |
| thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.\                         |
| 11 For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came    |
| unto the prophet Gad, David\'s seer, saying,\                         |
| 12 Go and say unto David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three     |
| things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.\         |
| []{#anchor384696}13 So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto |
| him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt  |
| thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee?  |
| or that there be three days\' pestilence in thy land? now advise, and |
| see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.\                  |
| 14 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now   |
| into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not  |
| fall into the hand of man.\                                           |
| 15 So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to |
| the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to     |
| Beer-sheba seventy thousand men.\                                     |
| 16 And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to        |
| destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel  |
| that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand. And the |
| angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.\ |
| 17 And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the |
| people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but    |
| these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be     |
| against me, and against my father\'s house.\                          |
| 18 And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an  |
| altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.\   |
| 19 And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD     |
| commanded.\                                                           |
| 20 And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on    |
| toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king   |
| on his face upon the ground.\                                         |
| 21 And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his        |
| servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build  |
| an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the        |
| people.\                                                              |
| 22 And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer   |
| up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt         |
| sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the     |
| oxen for wood.\                                                       |

| Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.\            |
| []{#anchor386663}24 And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will   |
| surely buy it of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt          |
| offerings unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So |
| David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of     |
| silver.\                                                              |

| mine infirmities.\                                                    |
| 6 For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I    |
| will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of   |
| me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.\     |

| strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I    |
