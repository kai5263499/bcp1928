| O ALMIGHTY God, who by thy blessed Son didst call Matthew from the    |
| receipt of custom to be an Apostle and Evangelist; Grant us grace to  |
| forsake all covetous desires, and inordinate love of riches, and to   |
| follow the same thy Son Jesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth with    |
| thee and the Holy Ghost, one God, world without end. Amen.\           |
|                                                                       |
| The Epistle. 2 Corinthians iv. 1.                                     |
|                                                                       |
| THEREFORE seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we |
| faint not; but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not    |
| walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but  |
| by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man\'s    |
| conscience in the sight of God. But if our gospel be hid, it is hid   |
| to them that are lost: in whom the god of this world hath blinded the |
| minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious       |
| gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.    |
| For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves |
| your servants for Jesus\' sake. For God, who commanded the light to   |
| shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light   |
| of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.\    |
|                                                                       |
| The Gospel. St. Matthew ix. 9.                                        |
|                                                                       |
| AND as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew,   |
| sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow me.   |
| And he arose, and followed him. And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at  |
| meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat    |
| down with him and his disciples. And when the Pharisees saw it, they  |
| said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and    |
| sinners? But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be   |
| whole need not a physician, but they that are sick. But go ye and     |
| learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I  |
| am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.         |
|                                                                       |
