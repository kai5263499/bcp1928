| 9 Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because  |
| with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD: and David the  |
| king also rejoiced with great joy.\                                   |
| 10 Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation: and  |
| David said, Blessed be thou, LORD God of Israel our father, for ever  |
| and ever.\                                                            |
| 11 Thine, O LORD, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and |
| the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in    |
| the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art        |
| exalted as head above all.\                                           |
| 12 Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all;   |
| and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make |
| great, and to give strength unto all.\                                |
| 13 Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious     |
| name.\                                                                |
| 14 But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to     |
| offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and  |
| of thine own have we given thee.\                                     |
| 15 For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all our  |

| Romans 10:1-15**\                                                     |
| 1 Brethren, my heart\'s desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that  |
| they might be saved.\                                                 |
| 2 For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not        |
| according to knowledge.\                                              |
| 3 For they being ignorant of God\'s righteousness, and going about to |
| establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto |
| the righteousness of God.\                                            |
| 4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one     |
| that believeth.\                                                      |
| 5 For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That    |
| the man which doeth those things shall live by them.\                 |
| 6 But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say  |
| not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring  |
| Christ down from above:)\                                             |
| 7 Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ   |
| again from the dead.)\                                                |
| 8 But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in |
| thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;\              |
| 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt |
| believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou   |
| shalt be saved.\                                                      |
| []{#anchor649478}10 For with the heart man believeth unto             |
| righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.\ |
| 11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be   |
| ashamed.\                                                             |
| 12 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the  |
| same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.\              |
| 13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be        |
| saved.\                                                               |
| 14 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?    |
| and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and    |
| how shall they hear without a preacher?\                              |
| 15 And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written,  |
| How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace,   |
| and bring glad tidings of good things!\                               |

| And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?\   |

| 16 And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good    |

| 17 And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good |

| 23 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a  |
| rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.\              |
| 24 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through   |

| book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.\                          |
| 6 And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four   |
| beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been   |
| slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits |
| of God sent forth into all the earth.\                                |

| golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints.\        |
