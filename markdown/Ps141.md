| \                                                                     |

| **Psalm 141. Domine, clamavi.**\                                      |
| LORD, I call upon thee; haste thee unto me, \* and consider my voice, |
| when I cry unto thee.\                                                |
| 2 Let my prayer be set forth in thy sight as the incense; \* and let  |
| the lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice.\                  |
| 3 Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth, \* and keep the door of my    |
| lips.\                                                                |
| 4 O let not mine heart be inclined to any evil thing; \* let me not   |
| be occupied in ungodly works with the men that work wickedness,       |
| neither let me eat of such things as please them.\                    |
| 5 Let the righteous rather smite me friendly, and reprove me; \* yea, |
| let not my head refuse their precious balms.\                         |
| 6 As for the ungodly, \* I will pray yet against their wickedness.\   |
| 7 Let their judges be overthrown in stony places, \* that they may    |
| hear my words; for they are sweet.\                                   |
| 8 Our bones lie scattered before the pit, \* like as when one         |
| breaketh and heweth wood upon the earth.\                             |
| 9 But mine eyes look unto thee, O LORD God; \* in thee is my trust; O |
| cast not out my soul.\                                                |
| 10 Keep me from the snare that they have laid for me, \* and from the |
| traps of the wicked doers.\                                           |
| 11 Let the ungodly fall into their own nets together, \* and let me   |
| ever escape them.                                                     |
