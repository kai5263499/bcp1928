**Psalm 102. Domine, exaudi.**\
HEAR my prayer, O LORD, \* and let my crying come unto thee.\
2 Hide not thy face from me in the time of my trouble; \* incline thine
ear unto me when I call; O hear me, and that right soon.\
3 For my days are consumed away like smoke, \* and my bones are burnt up
as it were a firebrand.\
4 My heart is smitten down, and withered like grass; \* so that I forget
to eat my bread.\
5 For the voice of my groaning, \* my bones will scarce cleave to my
flesh.\
6 I am become like a pelican in the wilderness, \* and like an owl that
is in the desert.\
7 I have watched, and am even as it were a sparrow, \* that sitteth
alone upon the housetop.\
8 Mine enemies revile me all the day long; \* and they that are mad upon
me are sworn together against me.\
9 For I have eaten ashes as it were bread, \* and mingled my drink with
weeping;\
10 And that, because of thine indignation and wrath; \* for thou hast
taken me up, and cast me down.\
11 My days are gone like a shadow, \* and I am withered like grass.\
12 But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever, \* and thy remembrance
throughout all generations.\
13 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Sion; \* for it is time that
thou have mercy upon her, yea, the time is come.\
14 And why? thy servants think upon her stones, \* and it pitieth them
to see her in the dust.\
15 The nations shall fear thy Name, O LORD; \* and all the kings of the
earth thy majesty;\
16 When the LORD shall build up Sion, \* and when his glory shall
appear;\
17 When he turneth him unto the prayer of the poor destitute, \* and
despiseth not their desire.\
18 This shall be written for those that come after, \* and the people
which shall be born shall praise the LORD.\
19 For he hath looked down from his sanctuary; \* out of the heaven did
the LORD behold the earth;\
20 That he might hear the mournings of such as are in captivity, \* and
deliver them that are appointed unto death;\
21 That they may declare the Name of the LORD in Sion, \* and his
worship at Jerusalem;\
22 When the peoples are gathered together, \* and the kingdoms also, to
serve the LORD.\
23 He brought down my strength in my journey, \* and shortened my days.\
24 But I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of mine age; \*
as for thy years, they endure throughout all generations.\
25 Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth,
\* and the heavens are the work of thy hands.\
26 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: \* they all shall wax old
as doth a garment;\
27 And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed;
\* but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.\
28 The children of thy servants shall continue, \* and their seed shall
stand fast in thy sight.\

**Psalm 103. Benedic, anima mea.**\
PRAISE the LORD, O my soul; \* and all that is within me, praise his
holy Name.\
2 Praise the LORD, O my soul, \* and forget not all his benefits:\
3 Who forgiveth all thy sin, \* and healeth all thine infirmities;\
4 Who saveth thy life from destruction, \* and crowneth thee with mercy
and loving-kindness;\
5 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things, \* making thee young and
lusty as an eagle.\
6 The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment \* for all them that are
oppressed with wrong.\
7 He showed his ways unto Moses, \* his works unto the children of
Israel.\
8 The LORD is full of compassion and mercy, \* longsuffering, and of
great goodness.\
9 He will not alway be chiding; \* neither keepeth he his anger for
ever.\
10 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; \* nor rewarded us
according to our wickednesses.\
11 For look how high the heaven is in comparison of the earth; \* so
great is his mercy also toward them that fear him.\
12 Look how wide also the east is from the west; \* so far hath he set
our sins from us.\
13 Yea, like as a father pitieth his own children; \* even so is the
LORD merciful unto them that fear him.\
14 For he knoweth whereof we are made; \* he remembereth that we are but
dust.\
15 The days of man are but as grass; \* for he flourisheth as a flower
of the field.\
16 For as soon as the wind goeth over it, it is gone; \* and the place
thereof shall know it no more.\
17 But the merciful goodness of the LORD endureth for ever and ever upon
them that fear him; \* and his righteousness upon children\'s children;\
18 Even upon such as keep his covenant, \* and think upon his
commandments to do them.\
19 The LORD hath prepared his seat in heaven, \* and his kingdom ruleth
over all.\
20 O praise the LORD, ye angels of his, ye that excel in strength; \* ye
that fulfil his commandment, and hearken unto the voice of his word.\
21 O praise the LORD, all ye his hosts; \* ye servants of his that do
his pleasure.\
22 O speak good of the LORD, all ye works of his, in all places of his
dominion: \* praise thou the LORD, O my soul.
