| **Psalm 58. Si vere utique.**\                                        |
| ARE your minds set upon righteousness, O ye congregation? \* and do   |
| ye judge the thing that is right, O ye sons of men?\                  |
| 2 Yea, ye imagine mischief in your heart upon the earth, \* and your  |
| hands deal with wickedness.\                                          |
| 3 The ungodly are froward, even from their mother\'s womb; \* as soon |
| as they are born, they go astray, and speak lies.\                    |
| 4 They are as venomous as the poison of a serpent, \* even like the   |
| deaf adder, that stoppeth her ears;\                                  |
| 5 Which refuseth to hear the voice of the charmer, \* charm he never  |
| so wisely.\                                                           |
| 6 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouths; \* smite the jaw-bones   |
| of the lions, O LORD.\                                                |
| 7 Let them fall away like water that runneth apace; \* when they      |
| shoot their arrows, let them be rooted out.\                          |
| 8 Let them consume away like a snail, and be like the untimely fruit  |
| of a woman; \* and let them not see the sun.\                         |
| 9 Or ever your pots be made hot with thorns, \* he shall take them    |
| away with a whirlwind, the green and the burning alike.\              |
| 10 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance; \* he     |
| shall wash his footsteps in the blood of the ungodly.\                |
| 11 So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the          |
| righteous; \* doubtless there is a God that judgeth the earth.        |
