| **Psalm 95. Venite, exultemus.**\                                     |
| O COME, let us sing unto the LORD; \* let us heartily rejoice in the  |
| strength of our salvation.\                                           |

| ourselves glad in him with psalms.\                                   |
| 3 For the LORD is a great God; \* and a great King above all gods.\   |
| 4 In his hand are all the corners of the earth; \* and the strength   |
| of the hills is his also.\                                            |
| 5 The sea is his, and he made it; \* and his hands prepared the dry   |
| land.\                                                                |

| our Maker.\                                                           |

| pasture, and the sheep of his hand.\                                  |
| 8 To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts \* as in   |
| the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness;\  |
| 9 When your fathers tempted me, \* proved me, and saw my works.\      |
| 10 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, \*  |
| It is a people that do err in their hearts, for they have not known   |
| my ways:\                                                             |

| salvation from day to day.\                                           |

| to be feared than all gods.\                                          |
| 5 As for all the gods of the heathen, they are but idols; \* but it   |
| is the LORD that made the heavens.\                                   |
| 6 Glory and worship are before him; \* power and honour are in his    |
| sanctuary.\                                                           |
| 7 Ascribe unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the peoples, \* ascribe     |
| unto the LORD worship and power.\                                     |
| 8 Ascribe unto the LORD the honour due unto his Name; \* bring        |
| presents, and come into his courts.\                                  |
| 9 O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness; \* let the whole      |
| earth stand in awe of him.\                                           |
| 10 Tell it out among the heathen, that the LORD is King, and that it  |
| is he who hath made the round world so fast that it cannot be moved;  |
| \* and how that he shall judge the peoples righteously.\              |
| 11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; \* let the sea |
| make a noise, and all that therein is.\                               |
| 12 Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it; \* then shall all  |
| the trees of the wood rejoice before the LORD.\                       |
| 13 For he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth; \* and with       |
| righteousness to judge the world, and the peoples with his truth.\    |
| \                                                                     |

| Psalm 97. Dominus regnavit.**\                                        |
| THE LORD is King, the earth may be glad thereof; \* yea, the          |
| multitude of the isles may be glad thereof.\                          |
| 2 Clouds and darkness are round about him: \* righteousness and       |
| judgment are the habitation of his seat.\                             |
| 3 There shall go a fire before him, \* and burn up his enemies on     |
| every side.\                                                          |
| 4 His lightnings gave shine unto the world: \* the earth saw it, and  |
| was afraid.\                                                          |
| 5 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD; \* at the    |
| presence of the Lord of the whole earth.\                             |
| 6 The heavens have declared his righteousness, \* and all the peoples |
| have seen his glory.\                                                 |
| 7 Confounded be all they that worship carved images, and that delight |
| in vain gods: \* worship him, all ye gods.\                           |
| 8 Sion heard of it, and rejoiced; and the daughters of Judah were     |
| glad, \* because of thy judgments, O LORD.\                           |
| 9 For thou, LORD, art higher than all that are in the earth: \* thou  |
| art exalted far above all gods.\                                      |
| 10 O ye that love the LORD, see that ye hate the thing which is evil: |
| \* the Lord preserveth the souls of his saints; he shall deliver them |
| from the hand of the ungodly.\                                        |
| 11 There is sprung up a light for the righteous, \* and joyful        |
| gladness for such as are true-hearted.\                               |
| 12 Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; \* and give thanks for a        |
| remembrance of his holiness.\                                         |
