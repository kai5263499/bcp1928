MERCIFUL Lord, we beseech thee to cast thy bright beams of light upon
thy Church, that it, being illumined by the doctrine of thy blessed
Apostle and Evangelist Saint John, may so walk in the light of thy
truth, that it may at length attain to life everlasting; through Jesus
Christ our Lord. Amen.\

The Epistle. 1 St. John i. 1.

THAT which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have
seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have
handled, of the Word of life; (for the life was manifested, and we have
seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which
was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;) that which we have
seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship
with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son
Jesus Christ. And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be
full. This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare
unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. If we say
that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do
not the truth: but if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we
have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son
cleanseth us from all sin. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive
ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is
faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
unrighteousness. If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar,
and his word is not in us.\

The Gospel. St. John xxi. 19.

JESUS saith unto Peter, Follow me. Then Peter, turning about, seeth the
disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at
supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee? Peter seeing
him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do? Jesus saith unto
him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? Follow
thou me. Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that
disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die;
but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? This is
the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things:
and we know that his testimony is true. And there are also many other
things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one,
I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that
should be written.
