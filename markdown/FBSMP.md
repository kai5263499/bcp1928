## [Daily Office: Morning Prayer (Sedona Rite) ]{.style11} {#daily-office-morning-prayer-sedona-rite .style9 align="center"}

::: {align="center"}
[¶ This version of Morning Prayer - commonly called **The Sedona
Rite** - is in accordance with the rubrics of the 1928 Book of Common
Prayer. Various prayers have been consolidated into this Rite and all
are found in the BCP. The \"Prayer for All Conditions of Mankind\" is a
compilation of the Office\'s prayers, with additions coming from the
\"Family Prayer\" and \"Prayers\" sections of the BCP. The parts that
are bracketed and italicised indicate how the office can be shortened,
as necessary. We suggest the shortened version for those who are new to
the recitation of the office, and recommend the lengthening of the
prayers as you are able to do so]{.style12}.

[CONFESSION\
]{.style6}

ALMIGHTY and most merciful Father; We have erred, and strayed from thy
ways like lost sheep. We have followed too much the devices and desires
of our own hearts. We have offended against thy holy laws. We have left
undone those things which we ought to have done; And we have done those
things which we ought not to have done; And there is no health in us.
But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us, miserable offenders. Spare thou
those, O God, who confess their faults. Restore thou those who are
penitent; According to thy promises declared unto mankind In Christ
Jesus our Lord. And grant, O most merciful Father, for his sake; That we
may hereafter live a godly, righteous, and sober life, To the glory of
thy holy Name. Amen.

**LORD'S PRAYER**

Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive those who
trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us
from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for
ever and ever. Amen.\
\
O Lord, open thou our lips.**\
And our mouth shall show forth thy praise.**\
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;**\
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without
end. Amen.**\
Praise ye the Lord.\
**The Lord\'s Name be praised.**

\
***Psalm 95. Venite, exultemus.***\

O COME, let us sing unto the LORD; \* let us heartily rejoice in the
strength of our salvation.\
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving; \* and show ourselves
glad in him with psalms.\
For the LORD is a great God; \* and a great King above all gods.\
In his hand are all the corners of the earth; \* and the strength of the
hills is his also.\
The sea is his, and he made it; \* and his hands prepared the dry land.\
O come, let us worship and fall down, \* and kneel before the LORD our
Maker.\
For he is the Lord our God; \* and we are the people of his pasture, and
the sheep of his hand.\
Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts \* as in the
provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness;\
When your fathers tempted me, \* proved me, and saw my works.\
Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, \* It is
a people that do err in their hearts, for they have not known my ways:\
Unto whom I sware in my wrath, \* that they should not enter into my
rest.\
GLORY be to the Father, and to the Son, \* and to the Holy Ghost;\
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, \* world without
end. Amen.

***Te Deum laudamus.***\

WE praise thee, O God; we acknowledge thee to be the Lord.\
All the earth doth worship thee, the Father everlasting.\
To thee all Angels cry aloud; the Heavens, and all the Powers therein;\
To thee Cherubim and Seraphim continually do cry,\
Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Sabaoth;\
Heaven and earth are full of the Majesty of thy glory.\
The glorious company of the Apostles praise thee.\
The goodly fellowship of the Prophets praise thee.\
The noble army of Martyrs praise thee.\
The holy Church throughout all the world doth acknowledge thee;\
The Father, of an infinite Majesty;\
Thine adorable, true, and only Son;\
Also the Holy Ghost, the Comforter.

THOU art the King of Glory, O Christ.\
Thou art the everlasting Son of the Father.\
When thou tookest upon thee to deliver man, thou didst humble thyself to
be born of a Virgin.\
When thou hadst overcome the sharpness of death, thou didst open the
Kingdom of Heaven to all believers.\
Thou sittest at the right hand of God, in the glory of the Father.\
We believe that thou shalt come to be our Judge.\
We therefore pray thee, help thy servants, whom thou hast redeemed with
thy precious blood.\
Make them to be numbered with thy Saints, in glory everlasting.

O LORD, save thy people, and bless thine heritage.\
Govern them, and lift them up for ever.\
Day by day we magnify thee;\
And we worship thy Name ever, world without end.\
Vouchsafe, O Lord, to keep us this day without sin.\
O Lord, have mercy upon us, have mercy upon us.\
O Lord, let thy mercy be upon us, as our trust is in thee.\
O Lord, in thee have I trusted; let me never be confounded.

***Benedictus. St. Luke i. 68.***\

Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; \* for he hath visited and redeemed
his people;\
And hath raised up a mighty salvation for us, \* in the house of his
servant David;\
As he spake by the mouth of his holy Prophets, \* which have been since
the world began;\
That we should be saved from our enemies, \* and from the hand of all
that hate us.\
To perform the mercy promised to our forefathers, \* and to remember his
holy covenant;\
To perform the oath which he sware to our forefather Abraham, \* that he
would give us;\
That we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies \* might serve
him without fear;\
In holiness and righteousness before him, \* all the days of our life.\
And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: \* for thou
shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;\
To give knowledge of salvation unto his people \* for the remission of
their sins,\
Through the tender mercy of our God; \* whereby the day-spring from on
high hath visited us;\
To give light to them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death,
\* and to guide our feet into the way of peace.\
GLORY be to the Father, and to the Son, \* and to the Holy Ghost;\
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, \* world without
end. Amen.

**\
The Apostles\' Creed.**

\
I Believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth:

And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord: Who was conceived by the Holy
Ghost, Born of the Virgin Mary: Suffered under Pontius Pilate, Was
crucified, dead, and buried: He descended into hell; The third day he
rose again from the dead: He ascended into heaven, And sitteth on the
right hand of God the Father Almighty: From thence he shall come to
judge the quick and the dead.

I believe in the Holy Ghost: The holy Catholic Church; The Communion of
Saints: The Forgiveness of sins: The Resurrection of the body: And the
Life + everlasting. Amen.

\
O Lord, show thy mercy upon us.\
**And grant us thy salvation.**\
O God, make clean our hearts within us.\
**And take not thy Holy Spirit from us.**\

**\
A Collect for Peace.**\

O God, who art the author of peace and lover of concord, in knowledge of
whom standeth our eternal life, whose service is perfect freedom; Defend
us thy humble servants in all assaults of our enemies; that we, surely
trusting in thy defence, may not fear the power of any adversaries,
through the might of Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

**A Collect for Grace.**\

O Lord, our heavenly Father, Almighty and everlasting God, who hast
safely brought us to the beginning of this day; Defend us in the same
with thy mighty power; and grant that this day we fall into no sin,
neither run into any kind of danger; but that all our doings, being
ordered by thy governance, may be righteous in thy sight; through Jesus
Christ our Lord. Amen.

**A Prayer for all Conditions of Mankind**.\

O GOD, the Creator and Preserver of all mankind, we humbly beseech thee
for all sorts and conditions of men; that thou wouldest be pleased to
make thy ways known unto them, thy saving health unto all nations. Grant
to all in authority wisdom and strength to know and to do thy will. Fill
them with the love of truth and righteousness; and make them ever
mindful of their calling to serve the people in thy fear.

MORE especially we pray for thy holy Church universal. Send down upon
our Bishops, and other Clergy, and upon the Congregations committed to
their charge, the healthful Spirit of thy grace; and, that they may
truly please thee, pour upon them the continual dew of thy blessing \[
*, that thy Church may be so guided and governed by thy good Spirit,
that all who profess and call themselves Christians may be led into the
way of truth, and hold the faith in unity of spirit, in the bond of
peace, and in righteousness of life*\] .

AND we commend to thy fatherly goodness all those who are any ways
afflicted, or distressed, in mind, body, or estate. \[*Remember in pity
such as are this day destitute, homeless, or forgotten of their
fellow-men. Bless the congregation of thy poor. Uplift those who are
cast down. Mightily befriend innocent sufferers, and sanctify to them
the endurance of their wrongs. Cheer with hope all discouraged and
unhappy people, and by thy heavenly grace preserve from falling those
whose poverty tempteth them to sin; though they be troubled on every
side, suffer them not to be distressed; though they be perplexed, save
them from despair. Pardon those who have done or wish us evil, and give
them repentance and better minds. Comfort and succour all prisoners,
especially those who are condemned to die. Give them a right
understanding of themselves, and of thy promises; that, trusting wholly
in thy mercy, they may not place their confidence anywhere but in thee.
Relieve the distressed, protect the innocent, awaken the guilty; and
forasmuch as thou alone bringest light out of darkness, and good out of
evil, grant to these thy servants, that by the power of thy Holy Spirit
they may be set free from the chains of sin, and may be brought to
newness of life.*\]\
\
AND be merciful, O Lord, to all whose duties are difficult or
burdensome, and comfort them concerning their toil. Protect the efforts
of sober and honest industry. Bless those who labour in works of mercy,
in schools of good learning, who care for the aged, little children, the
sick and the afflicted, and remember those who travel this day by land,
sea and air.

AND we beseech thee graciously to behold and bless those whom we love,
now absent from us. Defend them from all dangers of soul and body; and
grant that both they and we, drawing nearer to thee, may be bound
together by thy love in the communion of thy Holy Spirit, and in the
fellowship of all thy saints.

AND we do give thee most humble and hearty thanks for all thy goodness
and lovingkindness to us, and to all men; We bless thee for our
creation, preservation, and all the blessings of this life; but above
all, for thine inestimable love in the redemption of the world by our
Lord Jesus Christ; for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.

AND, we beseech thee, give us that due sense of all thy mercies, that
our hearts may be unfeignedly thankful; and that we show forth thy
praise, not only with our lips, but in our lives, by giving up our
selves to thy service, and by walking before thee in holiness and
righteousness all our days; through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom, with
thee and the Holy Ghost, be all honour and glory, world without end.
Amen.

**A Prayer of St. Chrysostom.**\

Almighty God, who hast given us grace at this time with one accord to
make our common supplications unto thee; and dost promise that when two
or three are gathered together in thy Name thou wilt grant their
requests; Fulfil now, O Lord, the desires and petitions of thy servants,
as may be most expedient for them; granting us in this world knowledge
of thy truth, and in the world to come life everlasting. Amen.

**2 Cor. xiii. 14.**\

THE grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the
fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. Amen.
