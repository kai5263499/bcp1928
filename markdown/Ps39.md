| \                                                                     |

| **Psalms 39. Dixi, Custodiam.**\                                      |
| I SAID, I will take heed to my ways, \* that I offend not in my       |
| tongue\                                                               |
| 2 I will keep my mouth as it were with a bridle, \* while the ungodly |
| is in my sight.\                                                      |
| 3 I held my tongue, and spake nothing: \* I kept silence, yea, even   |
| from good words; but it was pain and grief to me.\                    |
| 4 My heart was hot within me: and while I was thus musing the fire    |
| kindled, \* and at the last I spake with my tongue:\                  |
| 5 LORD, let me know mine end, and the number of my days; \* that I    |
| may be certified how long I have to live.\                            |
| 6 Behold, thou hast made my days as it were a span long, and mine age |
| is even as nothing in respect of thee; \* and verily every man living |
| is altogether vanity.\                                                |
| 7 For man walketh in a vain shadow, and disquieteth himself in vain;  |
| \* he heapeth up riches, and cannot tell who shall gather them.\      |
| 8 And now, Lord, what is my hope? \* truly my hope is even in thee.\  |
| 9 Deliver me from all mine offences; \* and make me not a rebuke unto |
| the foolish.\                                                         |
| 10 I became dumb, and opened not my mouth; \* for it was thy doing.\  |
| 11 Take thy plague away from me: \* I am even consumed by the means   |
| of thy heavy hand.\                                                   |
| 12 When thou with rebukes dost chasten man for sin, thou makest his   |
| beauty to consume away, like as it were a moth fretting a garment: \* |
| every man therefore is but vanity.\                                   |
| 13 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and with thine ears consider my calling;   |
| \* hold not thy peace at my tears;\                                   |
| 14 For I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, \* as all my       |
| fathers were.\                                                        |
| 15 O spare me a little, that I may recover my strength, \* before I   |
| go hence, and be no more seen.                                        |
