| **Psalm 19. Caeli enarrant.**\                                        |
| THE heavens declare the glory of God; \* and the firmament showeth    |
| his handy-work.\                                                      |
| 2 One day telleth another; \* and one night certifieth another.\      |
| 3 There is neither speech nor language; \* but their voices are heard |
| among them.\                                                          |
| 4 Their sound is gone out into all lands; \* and their words into the |
| ends of the world.\                                                   |
| 5 In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun; \* which cometh forth |
| as a bridegroom out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a giant to run   |
| his course.\                                                          |
| 6 It goeth forth from the uttermost part of the heaven, and runneth   |
| about unto the end of it again; \* and there is nothing hid from the  |
| heat thereof.\                                                        |
| 7 The law of the LORD is an undefiled law, converting the soul; \*    |
| the testimony of the LORD is sure, and giveth wisdom unto the         |
| simple.\                                                              |
| 8 The statutes of the LORD are right, and rejoice the heart; \* the   |
| commandment of the LORD is pure, and giveth light unto the eyes.\     |
| 9 The fear of the LORD is clean, and endureth for ever; \* the        |
| judgments of the LORD are true, and righteous altogether.\            |
| 10 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold;   |
| \* sweeter also than honey, and the honeycomb.\                       |
| 11 Moreover, by them is thy servant taught; \* and in keeping of them |
| there is great reward.\                                               |
| 12 Who can tell how oft he offendeth? \* O cleanse thou me from my    |
| secret faults.\                                                       |
| 13 Keep thy servant also from presumptuous sins, lest they get the    |
| dominion over me; \* so shall I be undefiled, and innocent from the   |
| great offence.\                                                       |
| 14 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be      |
| alway acceptable in thy sight, \* O LORD, my strength and my          |
| redeemer.\                                                            |
| **\                                                                   |
| Psalm 20. Exaudiat te Dominus.**\                                     |
| THE LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; \* the Name of the God of   |
| Jacob defend thee:\                                                   |
| 2 Send thee help from the sanctuary, \* and strengthen thee out of    |
| Sion:\                                                                |
| 3 Remember all thy offerings, \* and accept thy burnt-sacrifice:\     |
| 4 Grant thee thy heart\'s desire, \* and fulfil all thy mind.\        |
| 5 We will rejoice in thy salvation, and triumph in the Name of the    |
| Lord our God: \* the LORD perform all thy petitions.\                 |
| 6 Now know I that the LORD helpeth his anointed, and will hear him    |
| from his holy heaven, \* even with the wholesome strength of his      |
| right hand.\                                                          |
| 7 Some put their trust in chariots, and some in horses; \* but we     |
| will remember the Name of the LORD our God.\                          |
| 8 They are brought down and fallen; \* but we are risen and stand     |
| upright.\                                                             |
| 9 Save, LORD; and hear us, O King of heaven, \* when we call upon     |
| thee.\                                                                |
| \                                                                     |
| **\                                                                   |
| Psalm 21. Domine, in virtute tua.**\                                  |
| THE King shall rejoice in thy strength, O LORD; \* exceeding glad     |
| shall he be of thy salvation.\                                        |
| 2 Thou hast given him his heart\'s desire, \* and hast not denied him |
| the request of his lips.\                                             |
| 3 For thou shalt meet him with the blessings of goodness, \* and      |
| shalt set a crown of pure gold upon his head.\                        |
| 4 He asked life of thee; and thou gavest him a long life, \* even for |
| ever and ever.\                                                       |
| 5 His honour is great in thy salvation; \* glory and great worship    |
| shalt thou lay upon him.\                                             |
| 6 For thou shalt give him everlasting felicity, \* and make him glad  |
| with the joy of thy countenance.\                                     |
| 7 And why? because the King putteth his trust in the LORD; \* and in  |
| the mercy of the Most Highest he shall not miscarry.\                 |
| 8 All thine enemies shall feel thine hand; \* thy right hand shall    |
| find out them that hate thee.\                                        |
| 9 Thou shalt make them like a fiery oven in time of thy wrath: \* the |
| LORD shall destroy them in his displeasure, and the fire shall        |
| consume them.\                                                        |
| 10 Their fruit shalt thou root out of the earth, \* and their seed    |
| from among the children of men.\                                      |
| 11 For they intended mischief against thee, \* and imagined such a    |
| device as they are not able to perform.\                              |
| 12 Therefore shalt thou put them to flight, \* and the strings of thy |
| bow shalt thou make ready against the face of them.\                  |
| 13 Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength; \* so will we sing,  |
| and praise thy power.\                                                |
|                                                                       |

|                                                                       |
| **Psalm 22. Deus, Deus meus.**\                                       |
| MY God, my God, look upon me; why hast thou forsaken me? \* and art   |
| so far from my health, and from the words of my complaint?\           |
| 2 O my God, I cry in the day-time, but thou hearest not; \* and in    |
| the night season also I take no rest.\                                |
| 3 And thou continuest holy, \* O thou Worship of Israel.\             |
| 4 Our fathers hoped in thee; \* they trusted in thee, and thou didst  |
| deliver them.\                                                        |
| 5 They called upon thee, and were holpen; \* they put their trust in  |
| thee, and were not confounded.\                                       |
| 6 But as for me, I am a worm, and no man; \* a very scorn of men, and |
| the outcast of the people.\                                           |
| 7 All they that see me laugh me to scorn; \* they shoot out their     |
| lips, and shake their heads, saying,\                                 |
| 8 He trusted in the LORD, that he would deliver him; \* let him       |
| deliver him, if he will have him.\                                    |
| 9 But thou art he that took me out of my mother\'s womb; \* thou wast |
| my hope, when I hanged yet upon my mother\'s breasts.\                |
| 10 I have been left unto thee ever since I was born; \* thou art my   |
| God even from my mother\'s womb.\                                     |
| 11 O go not from me; for trouble is hard at hand, \* and there is     |
| none to help me.\                                                     |
| 12 Many oxen are come about me; \* fat bulls of Bashan close me in on |
| every side.\                                                          |
| 13 They gape upon me with their mouths, \* as it were a ramping and a |
| roaring lion.\                                                        |
| 14 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint; \*  |
| my heart also in the midst of my body is even like melting wax.\      |
| 15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my\                   |
| tongue cleaveth to my gums, \* and thou bringest me into the dust of  |
| death.\                                                               |
| 16 For many dogs are come about me, \* and the council of the wicked  |
| layeth siege against me.\                                             |
| 17 They pierced my hands and my feet: I may tell all my bones: \*     |
| they stand staring and looking upon me.\                              |
| 18 They part my garments among them, \* and cast lots upon my         |
| vesture.\                                                             |
| 19 But be not thou far from me, O LORD; \* thou art my succour, haste |
| thee to help me.\                                                     |
| 20 Deliver my soul from the sword, \* my darling from the power of    |
| the dog.\                                                             |
| 21 Save me from the lion\'s mouth; \* thou hast heard me also from    |
| among the horns of the unicorns.\                                     |
| 22 I will declare thy Name unto my brethren; \* in the midst of the   |
| congregation will I praise thee.\                                     |
| 23 O praise the LORD, ye that fear him: \* magnify him, all ye of the |
| seed of Jacob; and fear him, all ye seed of Israel.\                  |
| 24 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the low estate of the poor;  |
| \* he hath not hid his face from him; but when he called unto him he  |
| heard him.\                                                           |
| 25 My praise is of thee in the great-congregation; \* my vows will I  |
| perform in the sight of them that fear him.\                          |
| 26 The poor shall eat, and be satisfied; they that seek after the     |
| LORD shall praise him: \* your heart shall live for ever.\            |
| 27 All the ends of the world shall remember themselves, and be turned |
| unto the LORD; \* and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship   |
| before him.\                                                          |
| 28 For the kingdom is the LORD\'S, \* and he is the Governor among    |
| the nations.\                                                         |
| 29 All such as be fat upon earth \* have eaten, and worshipped.\      |
| 30 All they that go down into the dust shall kneel before him; \* and |
| no man hath quickened his own soul.\                                  |
| 31 My seed shall serve him: \* they shall be counted unto the Lord    |
| for a generation.\                                                    |
| 32 They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness \* unto a     |
| people that shall be born, whom the Lord hath made.\                  |
| \                                                                     |
| **\                                                                   |
| Psalm 23. Dominus regit me.**\                                        |
| THE LORD is my shepherd; \* therefore can I lack nothing.\            |
| 2 He shall feed me in a green pasture, \* and lead me forth beside    |
| the waters of comfort.\                                               |
| 3 He shall convert my soul, \* and bring me forth in the paths of     |
| righteousness for his Name\'s sake.\                                  |
| 4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I     |
| will fear no evil; \* for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff     |
| comfort me.\                                                          |
| 5 Thou shalt prepare a table before me in the presence of them that   |
| trouble me; \* thou hast anointed my head with oil, and my cup shall  |
| be full.\                                                             |
| 6 Surely thy loving-kindness and mercy shall follow me all the days   |
| of my life; \* and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.    |
|                                                                       |
