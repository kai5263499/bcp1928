| DEARLY beloved brethren, the Scripture moveth us, in sundry places,   |
| to acknowledge and confess our manifold sins and wickedness; and that |
| we should not dissemble nor cloak them before the face of Almighty    |
| God our heavenly Father; but confess them with an humble, lowly,      |
| penitent, and obedient heart; to the end that we may obtain           |
| forgiveness of the same, by his infinite goodness and mercy. And      |
| although we ought, at all times, humbly to acknowledge our sins       |
| before God; yet ought we chiefly so to do, when we assemble and meet  |
| together to render thanks for the great benefits that we have         |
| received at his hands, to set forth his most worthy praise, to hear   |
| his most holy Word, and to ask those things which are requisite and   |
| necessary, as well for the body as the soul. Wherefore I pray and     |
| beseech you, as many as are here present, to accompany me with a pure |
| heart, and humble voice, unto the throne of the heavenly grace,       |
| saying\--                                                             |

| ¶ Or he shall say,                                                    |
|                                                                       |

| ALMIGHTY and most merciful Father; We have erred, and strayed from    |
| thy ways like lost sheep. We have followed too much the devices and   |
| desires of our own hearts. We have offended against thy holy laws. We |
| have left undone those things which we ought to have done; And we     |
| have done those things which we ought not to have done; And there is  |
| no health in us. But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us, miserable      |
| offenders. Spare thou those, O God, who confess their faults. Restore |
| thou those who are penitent; According to thy promises declared unto  |
| mankind In Christ Jesus our Lord. And grant, O most merciful Father,  |
| for his sake; That we may hereafter live a godly, righteous, and      |
| sober life, To the glory of thy holy Name. Amen.\                     |

| ALMIGHTY God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who desireth not   |
| the death of a sinner, but rather that he may turn from his           |
| wickedness and live, hath given power, and commandment, to his        |
| Ministers, to declare and pronounce to his people, being penitent,    |
| the Absolution and Remission of their sins. He pardoneth and          |
| absolveth all those who truly repent, and unfeignedly believe his     |
| holy Gospel.\                                                         |

| Wherefore let us beseech him to grant us true repentance, and his     |
| Holy Spirit, that those things may please him which we do at this     |
| present; and that the rest of our life hereafter may be pure and      |
| holy; so that at the last we may come to his eternal joy; through     |
| Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.                                          |

| People still kneeling, and repeating it with him, both here, and      |

| and prosperity long to live; and finally, after this life, to attain  |
| everlasting joy and felicity; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.    |

| thee and the Holy Ghost, one God, world without end. Amen.\           |

| A Prayer for the Clergy and People.**\                                |
| Almighty and everlasting God, from whom cometh every good and perfect |
| gift; Send down upon our Bishops, and other Clergy, and upon the      |
| Congregations committed to their charge, the healthful Spirit of thy  |
| grace; and, that they may truly please thee, pour upon them the       |
| continual dew of thy blessing. Grant this, O Lord, for the honour of  |
| our Advocate and Mediator, Jesus Christ. Amen.\                       |
| **\                                                                   |
| A Prayer for all Conditions of Men.**\                                |
| O God, the Creator and Preserver of all mankind, we humbly beseech    |
| thee for all sorts and conditions of men; that thou wouldest be       |
| pleased to make thy ways known unto them, thy saving health unto all  |
| nations. More especially we pray for thy holy Church universal; that  |
| it may be so guided and governed by thy good Spirit, that all who     |
| profess and call themselves Christians may be led into the way of     |
| truth, and hold the faith in unity of spirit, in the bond of peace,   |
| and in righteousness of life. Finally, we commend to thy fatherly     |
| goodness all those who are any ways afflicted, or distressed, in      |
| mind, body, or estate; that it may please thee to comfort and relieve |
| them, according to their several necessities; giving them patience    |
| under their sufferings, and a happy issue out of all their            |
| afflictions. And this we beg for Jesus Christ\'s sake. Amen.\         |

| A General Thanksgiving.**\                                            |
| Almighty God, Father of all mercies, we, thine unworthy servants, do  |
| give thee most humble and hearty thanks for all thy goodness and      |
| lovingkindness to us, and to all men; We bless thee for our creation, |
| preservation, and all the blessings of this life; but above all, for  |
| thine inestimable love in the redemption of the world by our Lord     |
| Jesus Christ; for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory. And, |
| we beseech thee, give us that due sense of all thy mercies, that our  |
| hearts may be unfeignedly thankful; and that we show forth thy        |
| praise, not only with our lips, but in our lives, by giving up our    |
| selves to thy service, and by walking before thee in holiness and     |
| righteousness all our days; through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom,   |
| with thee and the Holy Ghost, be all honour and glory, world without  |
| end. Amen.\                                                           |

| A Prayer of St. Chrysostom.**\                                        |
| Almighty God, who hast given us grace at this time with one accord to |
| make our common supplications unto thee; and dost promise that when   |
| two or three are gathered together in thy Name thou wilt grant their  |
| requests; Fulfil now, O Lord, the desires and petitions of thy        |
| servants, as may be most expedient for them; granting us in this      |
| world knowledge of thy truth, and in the world to come life           |
| everlasting. Amen.\                                                   |
