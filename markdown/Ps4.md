| **Psalms 4. Cum invocarem.**\                                         |
| HEAR me when I call, O God of my righteousness: \* thou hast set me   |
| at liberty when I was in trouble; have mercy upon me, and hearken     |
| unto my prayer.\                                                      |
| 2 O ye sons of men, how long will ye blaspheme mine honour, \* and    |
| have such pleasure in vanity, and seek after falsehood?\              |
| 3 Know this also, that the LORD hath chosen to himself the man that   |
| is godly; \* when I call upon the LORD he will hear me.\              |
| 4 Stand in awe, and sin not; \* commune with your own heart, and in   |
| your chamber, and be still.\                                          |
| 5 Offer the sacrifice of righteousness, \* and put your trust in the  |
| LORD.\                                                                |
| 6 There be many that say, \* Who will show us any good?\              |
| 7 LORD, lift thou up\* the light of thy countenance upon us.\         |
| 8 Thou hast put gladness in my heart; \* yea, more than when their    |
| corn and wine and oil increase.\                                      |
| 9 I will lay me down in peace, and take my rest; \* for it is thou,   |
| LORD, only, that makest me dwell in safety.                           |
