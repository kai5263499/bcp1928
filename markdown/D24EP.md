**Psalm 119. I. Beati immaculati.**\
BLESSED are those that are undefiled in the way, and walk in the law of
the LORD.\
2 Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, \* and seek him with their
whole heart;\
3 Even they who do no wickedness, \* and walk in his ways.\
4 Thou hast charged \* that we shall diligently keep thy commandments.\
5 O that my ways were made so direct, \* that I might keep thy
statutes!\
6 So shall I not be confounded, \* while I have respect unto all thy
commandments.\
7 I will thank thee with an unfeigned heart, \* when I shall have
learned the judgments of thy righteousness.\
8 I will keep thy statutes; \* O forsake me not utterly.\

**II. In quo corrigit?**\
WHEREWITHAL shall a young man cleanse his way? \* even by ruling himself
after thy word.\
10 With my whole heart have I sought thee; \* O let me not go wrong out
of thy commandments.\
11 Thy word have I hid within my heart, \* that I should not sin against
thee.\
12 Blessed art thou, O LORD; \* O teach me thy statutes.\
13 With my lips have I been telling \* of all the judgments of thy
mouth.\
14 I have had as great delight in the way of thy testimonies, \* as in
all manner of riches.\
15 I will talk of thy commandments, \* and have respect unto thy ways.\
16 My delight shall be in thy statutes, \* and I will not forget thy
word.\

**III. Retribue servo tuo.**\
O DO well unto thy servant; \* that I may live, and keep thy word.\
18 Open thou mine eyes; \* that I may see the wondrous things of thy
law.\
19 I am a stranger upon earth; \* O hide not thy commandments from me.\
20 My soul breaketh out for the very fervent desire \* that it hath
alway unto thy judgments.\
21 Thou hast rebuked the proud; \* and cursed are they that do err from
thy commandments.\
22 O turn from me shame and rebuke; \* for I have kept thy testimonies.\
23 Princes also did sit and speak against me; \* but thy servant is
occupied in thy statutes.\
24 For thy testimonies are my delight, \* and my counsellors.

**IV. Adhaesit pavimento.**\
MY soul cleaveth to the dust; \* O quicken thou me, according to thy
word.\
26 I have acknowledged my ways, and thou heardest me: \* O teach me thy
statutes.\
27 Make me to understand the way of thy commandments; \* and so shall I
talk of thy wondrous works.\
28 My soul melteth away for very heaviness; \* comfort thou me according
unto thy word.\
29 Take from me the way of lying, \* and cause thou me to make much of
thy law.\
30 I have chosen the way of truth, \* and thy judgments have I laid
before me.\
31 I have stuck unto thy testimonies; \* O LORD, confound me not.\
32 I will run the way of thy commandments, \* when thou hast set my
heart at liberty.
