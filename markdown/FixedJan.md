| me is not after man.\                                                 |
| 12 For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by  |
| the revelation of Jesus Christ.\                                      |
| 13 For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews\'    |
| religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and |
| wasted it:\                                                           |

| fathers.\                                                             |

| and called me by his grace,\                                          |

| heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:\           |
| 17 Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before  |
| me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.\        |
| 18 Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and    |
| abode with him fifteen days.\                                         |

| they kept the more silence: and he saith,)\                           |
| 3 I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in         |
| Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and     |
| taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and |
| was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.\                      |
| 4 And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering    |
| into prisons both men and women.\                                     |
| 5 As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of |
| the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and  |
| went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto           |
| Jerusalem, for to be punished.\                                       |
| 6 And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh  |
| unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great    |
| light round about me.\                                                |
| 7 And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, |
| Saul, why persecutest thou me?\                                       |
| 8 And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus |
| of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.\                                  |
| 9 And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid;   |
| but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.\                |
| 10 And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me,      |
| Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all   |
| things which are appointed for thee to do.\                           |
| 11 And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by |
| the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.\            |
| 12 And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good  |
| report of all the Jews which dwelt there,\                            |
| 13 Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive   |
| thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.\                   |
| 14 And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou    |
| shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear    |
| the voice of his mouth.\                                              |
| 15 For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen  |
| and heard.\                                                           |
| 16 And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away   |
| thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.\                           |
| 17 And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem,     |
| even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;\                |
| 18 And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out   |
| of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.\ |
| 19 And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every    |
| synagogue them that believed on thee:\                                |
| 20 And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was      |
| standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of   |
| them that slew him.\                                                  |
| 21 And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto   |

| 1 It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to       |

| 2 I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the    |
| body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God   |
| knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.\                 |

| words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.\                    |
| 5 Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in |
| mine infirmities.\                                                    |
| 6 For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I    |
| will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of   |
| me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.\     |
| 7 And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of |
| the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the      |

| 4 Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,\                    |
| 5 Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou      |
| camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a |
| prophet unto the nations.\                                            |
| 6 Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a       |
| child.\                                                               |
| 7 But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt go |
| to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou     |
| shalt speak.\                                                         |
| 8 Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee,   |
| saith the LORD.\                                                      |
| 9 Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the     |
| LORD said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.\         |
| 10 See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the        |
| kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw |
| down, to build, and to plant.\                                        |

| 10 Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I  |
| shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests;  |
| and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.\       |
| 11 And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to  |
| blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them  |
| even unto strange cities.\                                            |
| 12 Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from |
| the chief priests,\                                                   |
| 13 At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the |
| brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which          |
| journeyed with me.\                                                   |
| 14 And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking |
| unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest |
| thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.\             |
| 15 And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou  |
| persecutest.\                                                         |
| 16 But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee   |
| for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these |
| things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will  |
| appear unto thee;\                                                    |
| 17 Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom  |
| now I send thee,\                                                     |
| 18 To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and   |
| from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness   |
| of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith     |
| that is in me.\                                                       |
| 19 Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly |
| vision:\                                                              |
| 20 But showed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and      |
| throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that   |
| they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for             |
| repentance.\                                                          |
| 21 For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about  |
| to kill me.\                                                          |
| 22 Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day,   |
| witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than     |
| those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:\              |
| 23 That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that    |
| should rise from the dead, and should show light unto the people, and |
| to the Gentiles.\                                                     |
