| \                                                                     |
|                                                                       |
| **Psalm 73. Quam bonus Israel!**\                                     |
| TRULY God is loving unto Israel: \* even unto such as are of a clean  |
| heart.\                                                               |
| 2 Nevertheless, my feet were almost gone, \* my treadings had         |
| well-nigh slipt.\                                                     |
| 3 And why? I was grieved at the wicked: \* I do also see the ungodly  |
| in such prosperity.\                                                  |
| 4 For they are in no peril of death; \* but are lusty and strong.\    |
| 5 They come in no misfortune like other folk; \* neither are they     |
| plagued like other men.\                                              |
| 6 And this is the cause that they are so holden with pride, \* and    |
| cruelty covereth them as a garment.\                                  |
| 7 Their eyes swell with fatness, \* and they do even what they lust.\ |
| 8 They corrupt other, and speak of wicked blasphemy; \* their talking |
| is against the Most High.\                                            |
| 9 For they stretch forth their mouth unto the heaven, \* and their    |
| tongue goeth through the world.\                                      |
| 10 Therefore fall the people unto them, \* and thereout suck they no  |
| small advantage.\                                                     |
| 11 Tush, say they, how should God perceive it? \* is there knowledge  |
| in the Most High?\                                                    |
| 12 Lo, these are the ungodly, \* these prosper in the world, and      |
| these have riches in possession:\                                     |
| 13 And I said, Then have I cleansed my heart in vain, \* and washed   |
| my hands in innocency.\                                               |
| 14 All the day long have I been punished, \* and chastened every      |
| morning.\                                                             |
| 15 Yea, and I had almost said even as they; \* but lo, then I should  |
| have condemned the generation of thy children.\                       |
| 16 Then thought I to understand this; \* but it was too hard for me,\ |
| 17 Until I went into the sanctuary of God: \* then understood I the   |
| end of these men;\                                                    |
| 18 Namely, how thou dost set them in slippery places, \* and castest  |
| them down, and destroyest them.\                                      |
| 19 O how suddenly do they consume, \* perish, and come to a fearful   |
| end!\                                                                 |
| 20 Yea, even like as a dream when one awaketh; \* so shalt thou make  |
| their image to vanish out of the city.\                               |
| 21 Thus my heart was grieved, \* and it went even through my reins.\  |
| 22 So foolish was I, and ignorant, \* even as it were a beast before  |
| thee.\                                                                |
| 23 Nevertheless, I am alway by thee; \* for thou hast holden me by my |
| right hand.\                                                          |
| 24 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, \* and after that receive me |
| with glory.\                                                          |
| 25 Whom have I in heaven but thee? \* and there is none upon earth    |
| that I desire in comparison of thee.\                                 |
| 26 My flesh and my heart faileth; \* but God is the strength of my    |
| heart, and my portion for ever.\                                      |
| 27 For lo, they that forsake thee shall perish; \* thou hast          |
| destroyed all them that are unfaithful unto thee.\                    |
| 28 But it is good for me to hold me fast by God, to put my trust in   |
| the Lord GOD, \* and to speak of all thy works in the gates of the    |
| daughter of Sion.                                                     |
