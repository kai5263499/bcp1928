| **Psalms 26. Judica me, Domine.\                                      |
| **BE thou my Judge, O LORD, for I have walked innocently: \* my trust |
| hath been also in the LORD, therefore shall I not fall.\              |
| 2 Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; \* try out my reins and my        |
| heart.\                                                               |
| 3 For thy loving-kindness is ever before mine eyes; \* and I will     |
| walk in thy truth.\                                                   |
| 4 I have not dwelt with vain persons; \* neither will I have          |
| fellowship with the deceitful.\                                       |
| 5 I have hated the congregation of the wicked; \* and will not sit    |
| among the ungodly.\                                                   |
| 6 I will wash my hands in innocency, O LORD; \* and so will I go to   |
| thine altar;\                                                         |
| 7 That I may show the voice of thanksgiving, \* and tell of all thy   |
| wondrous works.\                                                      |
| 8 LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, \* and the place    |
| where thine honour dwelleth.\                                         |
| 9 O shut not up my soul with the sinners, \* nor my life with the     |
| blood-thirsty;\                                                       |
| 10 In whose hands is wickedness, \* and their right hand is full of   |
| gifts.\                                                               |
| 11 But as for me, I will walk innocently: \* O deliver me, and be     |
| merciful unto me.\                                                    |
| 12 My foot standeth right: \* I will praise the LORD in the           |
| congregations.                                                        |
