| **Psalm 120. Ad Dominum.**\                                           |
| WHEN I was in trouble, I called upon the LORD, \* and he heard me.\   |
| 2 Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, \* and from a deceitful   |
| tongue.\                                                              |
| 3 What reward shall be given or done unto thee, thou false tongue? \* |
| even mighty and sharp arrows, with hot burning coals.\                |
| 4 Woe is me, that I am constrained to dwell with Meshech, \* and to   |
| have my habitation among the tents of Kedar!\                         |
| 5 My soul hath long dwelt among them \* that are enemies unto peace.\ |
| 6 I labour for peace; but when I speak unto them thereof, \* they     |
| make them ready to battle.                                            |
