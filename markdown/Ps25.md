| **Psalms 25 . Ad te, Domine, levavi.**\                               |
| UNTO thee, O LORD, will I lift up my soul; my God, I have put my      |
| trust in thee: \* O let me not be confounded, neither let mine        |
| enemies triumph over me.\                                             |
| 2 For all they that hope in thee shall not be ashamed; \* but such as |
| transgress without a cause shall be put to confusion.\                |
| 3 Show me thy ways, O LORD, \* and teach me thy paths.\               |
| 4 Lead me forth in thy truth, and learn me: \* for thou art the God   |
| of my salvation; in thee hath been my hope all the day long.\         |
| 5 Call to remembrance, O LORD, thy tender mercies, \* and thy         |
| loving-kindnesses, which have been ever of old.\                      |
| 6 O remember not the sins and offences of my youth; \* but according  |
| to thy mercy think thou upon me, O LORD, for thy goodness.\           |
| 7 Gracious and righteous is the LORD; \* therefore, will he teach     |
| sinners in the way.\                                                  |
| 8 Them that are meek shall he guide in judgment; \* and such as are   |
| gentle, them shall he learn his way.\                                 |
| 9 All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth, \* unto such as keep |
| his covenant and his testimonies.\                                    |
| 10 For thy Name\'s sake, O LORD, \* be merciful unto my sin; for it   |
| is great.\                                                            |
| 11 What man is he that feareth the LORD? \* him shall he teach in the |
| way that he shall choose.\                                            |
| 12 His soul shall dwell at ease, \* and his seed shall inherit the    |
| land.\                                                                |
| 13 The secret of the LORD is among them that fear him; \* and he will |
| show them his covenant.\                                              |
| 14 Mine eyes are ever looking unto the LORD; \* for he shall pluck my |
| feet out of the net.\                                                 |
| 15 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; \* for I am desolate,   |
| and in misery.\                                                       |
| 16 The sorrows of my heart are enlarged: \* O bring thou me out of my |
| troubles.\                                                            |
| 17 Look upon my adversity and misery, \* and forgive me all my sin.\  |
| 18 Consider mine enemies, how many they are; \* and they bear a       |
| tyrannous hate against me.\                                           |
| 19 O keep my soul, and deliver me: \* let me not be confounded, for I |
| have put my trust in thee.\                                           |
| 20 Let perfectness and righteous dealing wait upon me; \* for my hope |
| hath been in thee.\                                                   |
| 21 Deliver Israel, O God, \* out of all his troubles.                 |
