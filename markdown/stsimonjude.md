| O ALMIGHTY God, who hast built thy Church upon the foundation of the  |
| Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the head            |
| corner-stone; Grant us so to be joined together in unity of spirit by |
| their doctrine, that we may be made an holy temple acceptable unto    |
| thee; through the same Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\                  |
|                                                                       |
| The Epistle. Ephesians ii. 19.                                        |

| NOW therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but            |
| fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God; and are |
| built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ  |
| himself being the chief corner-stone; in whom all the building fitly  |
| framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: in whom ye   |
| also are builded together for an habitation of God through the        |
| Spirit.\                                                              |

| The Gospel. St. John xv. 17.                                          |
|                                                                       |
| THESE things I command you, that ye love one another. If the world    |
| hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of |
| the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of    |
| the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the      |
| world hateth you. Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant |
| is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will   |
| also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep       |
| your\'s also. But all these things will they do unto you for my       |
| name\'s sake, because they know not him that sent me. If I had not    |
| come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no |
| cloke for their sin. He that hateth me hateth my Father also. If I    |
| had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had  |
| not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my     |
| Father. But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled     |
| that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause. But when |
| the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father,     |
| even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall  |
| testify of me: and ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been   |
| with me from the beginning.                                           |
|                                                                       |
