| **Psalm 57. Miserere mei, Deus.**\                                    |
| BE merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me; for my soul trusteth |
| in thee; \* and under the shadow of thy wings shall be my refuge,     |
| until this tyranny be overpast.\                                      |
| 2 I will call unto the Most High God, \* even unto the God that shall |
| perform the cause which I have in hand.\                              |
| 3 He shall send from heaven, \* and save me from the reproof of him   |
| that would eat me up.\                                                |
| 4 God shall send forth his mercy and truth: \* my soul is among       |
| lions;\                                                               |
| 5 And I lie even among the children of men, that are set on fire, \*  |
| whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.\   |
| 6 Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens; \* and thy glory above    |
| all the earth.\                                                       |
| 7 They have laid a net for my feet, and pressed down my soul; \* they |
| have digged a pit before me, and are fallen into the midst of it      |
| themselves.\                                                          |
| 8 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed; \* I will sing and     |
| give praise.\                                                         |
| 9 Awake up, my glory; awake, lute and harp: \* I myself will awake    |
| right early.\                                                         |
| 10 I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the peoples; \* and I  |
| will sing unto thee among the nations.\                               |
| 11 For the greatness of thy mercy reacheth unto the heavens, \* and   |
| thy truth unto the clouds.\                                           |
| 12 Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens; \* and thy glory above   |
| all the earth.                                                        |
