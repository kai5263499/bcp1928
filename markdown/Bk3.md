The Psalter or Psalms of David

\
**BOOK III.**\
Evening Prayer.

**Psalm 73. Quam bonus Israel!**\
TRULY God is loving unto Israel: \* even unto such as are of a clean
heart.\
2 Nevertheless, my feet were almost gone, \* my treadings had well-nigh
slipt.\
3 And why? I was grieved at the wicked: \* I do also see the ungodly in
such prosperity.\
4 For they are in no peril of death; \* but are lusty and strong.\
5 They come in no misfortune like other folk; \* neither are they
plagued like other men.\
6 And this is the cause that they are so holden with pride, \* and
cruelty covereth them as a garment.\
7 Their eyes swell with fatness, \* and they do even what they lust.\
8 They corrupt other, and speak of wicked blasphemy; \* their talking is
against the Most High.\
9 For they stretch forth their mouth unto the heaven, \* and their
tongue goeth through the world.\
10 Therefore fall the people unto them, \* and thereout suck they no
small advantage.\
11 Tush, say they, how should God perceive it? \* is there knowledge in
the Most High?\
12 Lo, these are the ungodly, \* these prosper in the world, and these
have riches in possession:\
13 And I said, Then have I cleansed my heart in vain, \* and washed my
hands in innocency.\
14 All the day long have I been punished, \* and chastened every
morning.\
15 Yea, and I had almost said even as they; \* but lo, then I should
have condemned the generation of thy children.\
16 Then thought I to understand this; \* but it was too hard for me,\
17 Until I went into the sanctuary of God: \* then understood I the end
of these men;\
18 Namely, how thou dost set them in slippery places, \* and castest
them down, and destroyest them.\
19 O how suddenly do they consume, \* perish, and come to a fearful
end!\
20 Yea, even like as a dream when one awaketh; \* so shalt thou make
their image to vanish out of the city.\
21 Thus my heart was grieved, \* and it went even through my reins.\
22 So foolish was I, and ignorant, \* even as it were a beast before
thee.\
23 Nevertheless, I am alway by thee; \* for thou hast holden me by my
right hand.\
24 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, \* and after that receive me
with glory.\
25 Whom have I in heaven but thee? \* and there is none upon earth that
I desire in comparison of thee.\
26 My flesh and my heart faileth; \* but God is the strength of my
heart, and my portion for ever.\
27 For lo, they that forsake thee shall perish; \* thou hast destroyed
all them that are unfaithful unto thee.\
28 But it is good for me to hold me fast by God, to put my trust in the
Lord GOD, \* and to speak of all thy works in the gates of the daughter
of Sion.\
\
**\
Psalm 74. Ut quid, Deus?**\
O GOD, wherefore art thou absent from us so long? \* why is thy wrath so
hot against the sheep of thy pasture?\
2 O think upon thy congregation, \* whom thou hast purchased, and
redeemed of old.\
3 Think upon the tribe of thine inheritance, \* and Mount Sion, wherein
thou hast dwelt.\
4 Lift up thy feet, that thou mayest utterly destroy every enemy, \*
which hath done evil in thy sanctuary.\
5 Thine adversaries roar in the midst of thy congregations, \* and set
up their banners for tokens.\
6 He that hewed timber afore out of the thick trees, \* was known to
bring it to an excellent work.\
7 But now they break down all the carved work thereof \* with axes and
hammers.\
8 They have set fire upon thy holy places, \* and have defiled the
dwelling-place of thy Name, even unto the ground.\
9 Yea, they said in their hearts, Let us make havoc of them altogether:
\* thus have they burnt up all the houses of God in the land.\
10 We see not our tokens; there is not one prophet more; \* no, not one
is there among us, that understandeth any more.\
11 O God, how long shall the adversary do this dishonour? \* shall the
enemy blaspheme thy Name for ever?\
12 Why withdrawest thou thy hand? \* why pluckest thou not thy right
hand out of thy bosom to consume the enemy?\
13 For God is my King of old; \* the help that is done upon earth, he
doeth it himself.\
14 Thou didst divide the sea through thy power; \* thou brakest the
heads of the dragons in the waters.\
15 Thou smotest the heads of leviathan in pieces, \* and gavest him to
be meat for the people of the wilderness.\
16 Thou broughtest out fountains and waters out of the hard rocks; \*
thou driedst up mighty waters.\
17 The day is thine, and the night is thine; \* thou hast prepared the
light and the sun.\
18 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth; \* thou hast made summer
and winter.\
19 Remember this, O LORD, how the enemy hath rebuked; \* and how the
foolish people hath blasphemed thy Name.\
20 O deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the multitude of the
enemies; \* and forget not the congregation of the poor for ever.\
21 Look upon the covenant; \* for all the earth is full of darkness and
cruel habitations.\
22 O let not the simple go away ashamed; \* but let the poor and needy
give praise unto thy Name.\
23 Arise, O God, maintain thine own cause; \* remember how the foolish
man blasphemeth thee daily.\
24 Forget not the voice of thine enemies: \* the presumption of them
that hate thee increaseth ever more and more.\

The Fifteenth Day.\
\
Morning Prayer.

**Psalm 75. Confitebimur tibi.**\
UNTO thee, O God, do we give thanks; \* yea, unto thee do we give
thanks.\
2 Thy Name also is so nigh; \* and that do thy wondrous works declare.\
3 In the appointed time, saith God, \* I shall judge according unto
right.\
4 The earth is weak, and all the inhabiters thereof: \* I bear up the
pillars of it.\
5 I said unto the fools, Deal not so madly; \* and to the ungodly, Set
not up your horn.\
6 Set not up your horn on high, \* and speak not with a stiff neck.\
7 For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, \* nor
yet from the south.\
8 And why? God is the Judge; \* he putteth down one, and setteth up
another.\
9 For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; \* it
is full mixt, and he poureth out of the same.\
10 As for the dregs thereof, \* all the ungodly of the earth shall drink
them, and suck them out.\
11 But I will talk of the God of Jacob, \* and praise him for ever.\
12 All the horns of the ungodly also will I break, \* and the horns of
the righteous shall be exalted.\
\
**\
Psalm 76. Notus in Judaea.**\
IN Judah is God known; \* his Name is great in Israel.\
2 At Salem is his tabernacle, \* and his dwelling in Sion.\
3 There brake he the arrows of the bow, \* the shield, the sword, and
the battle.\
4 Thou art glorious in might, \* when thou comest from the hills of the
robbers.\
5 The proud are robbed, they have slept their sleep; \* and all the men
whose hands were mighty have found nothing.\
6 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, \* both the chariot and horse are
fallen.\
7 Thou, even thou art to be feared; \* and who may stand in thy sight
when thou art angry?\
8 Thou didst cause thy judgment to be heard from heaven; \* the earth
trembled, and was still,\
9 When God arose to judgment, \* and to help all the meek upon earth.\
10 The fierceness of man shall turn to thy praise; \* and the fierceness
of them shalt thou refrain.\
11 Promise unto the LORD your God, and keep it, all ye that are round
about him; \* bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.\
12 He shall refrain the spirit of princes, \* and is wonderful among the
kings of the earth.\
**\
Psalm 77. Voce mea ad Dominum.**\
I WILL cry unto God with my voice; \* even unto God will I cry with my
voice, and he shall hearken unto me.\
2 In the time of my trouble I sought the Lord: \* I stretched forth my
hands unto him, and ceased not in the night season; my soul refused
comfort.\
3 When I am in heaviness, I will think upon God; \* when my heart is
vexed, I will complain.\
4 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: \* I am so feeble that I cannot speak.\
5 I have considered the days of old, \* and the years that are past.\
6 I call to remembrance my song, \* and in the night I commune with mine
own heart, and search out my spirit.\
7 Will the Lord absent himself for ever? \* and will he be no more
intreated?\
8 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? \* and is his promise come utterly
to an end for evermore?\
9 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? \* and will he shut up his
loving-kindness in displeasure?\
10 And I said, It is mine own infirmity; \* but I will remember the
years of the right hand of the Most Highest.\
11 I will remember the works of the LORD, \* and call to mind thy
wonders of old time.\
12 I will think also of all thy works, \* and my talking shall be of thy
doings.\
13 Thy way, O God, is holy: \* who is so great a God as our God?\
14 Thou art the God that doest wonders, \* and hast declared thy power
among the peoples.\
15 Thou hast mightily delivered thy people, \* even the sons of Jacob
and Joseph.\
16 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee, and were afraid; \*
the depths also were troubled.\
17 The clouds poured out water, the air thundered, \* and thine arrows
went abroad.\
18 The voice of thy thunder was heard round about: \* the lightnings
shone upon the ground; the earth was moved, and shook withal.\
19 Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in the great waters, \* and thy
footsteps are not known.\
20 Thou leddest thy people like sheep, \* by the hand of Moses and
Aaron.\

Evening Prayer.

**Psalm 78. Attendite, popule.**\
HEAR my law, O my people; \* incline your ears unto the words of my
mouth.\
2 I will open my mouth in a parable; \* I will declare hard sentences of
old;\
3 Which we have heard and known, \* and such as our fathers have told
us;\
4 That we should not hide them from the children of the generations to
come; \* but to show the honour of the LORD, his mighty and wonderful
works that he hath done.\
5 He made a covenant with Jacob, and gave Israel a law, \* which he
commanded our forefathers to teach their children;\
6 That their posterity might know it, \* and the children which were yet
unborn;\
7 To the intent that when they came up, \* they might show their
children the same;\
8 That they might put their trust in God; \* and not to forget the works
of God, but to keep his commandments;\
9 And not to be as their forefathers, a faithless and stubborn
generation; \* a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose
spirit clave not stedfastly unto God;\
10 Like as the children of Ephraim; \* who being harnessed, and carrying
bows, turned themselves back in the day of battle.\
11 They kept not the covenant of God, \* and would not walk in his law;\
12 But forgat what he had done, \* and the wonderful works that he had
showed for them.\
13 Marvellous things did he in the sight of our forefathers, in the land
of Egypt, \* even in the field of Zoan.\
14 He divided the sea, and let them go through; \* he made the waters to
stand on an heap.\
15 In the day-time also he led them with a cloud, \* and all the night
through with a light of fire.\
16 He clave the hard rocks in the wilderness, \* and gave them drink
thereof, as it had been out of the great depth.\
17 He brought waters out of the stony rock, \* so that it gushed out
like the rivers.\
18 Yet for all this they sinned more against him, \* and provoked the
Most Highest in the wilderness.\
19 They tempted God in their hearts, \* and required meat for their
lust.\
20 They spake against God also, saying, \* Shall God prepare a table in
the wilderness?\
21 He smote the stony rock indeed, that the water gushed out, and the
streams flowed withal; \* but can he give bread also, or provide flesh
for his people?\
22 When the LORD heard this, he was wroth; \* so the fire was kindled in
Jacob, and there came up heavy displeasure against Israel;\
23 Because they believed not in God, \* and put not their trust in his
help.\
24 So he commanded the clouds above, \* and opened the doors of heaven.\
25 He rained down manna also upon them for to eat, \* and gave them food
from heaven.\
26 So man did eat angels\' food; \* for he sent them meat enough.\
27 He caused the east-wind to blow under heaven; \* and through his
power he brought in the southwest-wind.\
28 He rained flesh upon them as thick as dust, \* and feathered fowls
like as the sand of the sea.\
29 He let it fall among their tents, \* even round about their
habitation.\
30 So they did eat, and were well filled; for he gave them their own
desire: \* they were not disappointed of their lust.\
31 But while the meat was yet in their mouths, the heavy wrath of God
came upon them, and slew the wealthiest of them; \* yea, and smote down
the chosen men that were in Israel.\
32 But for all this they sinned yet more, \* and believed not his
wondrous works.\
33 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, \* and their years in
trouble.\
34 When he slew them, they sought him, \* and turned them early, and
inquired after God.\
35 And they remembered that God was their strength, \* and that the High
God was their redeemer.\
36 Nevertheless, they did but flatter him with their mouth, \* and
dissembled with him in their tongue.\
37 For their heart was not whole with him, \* neither continued they
stedfast in his covenant.\
38 But he was so merciful, that he forgave their misdeeds, \* and
destroyed them not.\
39 Yea, many a time turned he his wrath away, \* and would not suffer
his whole displeasure to arise.\
40 For he considered that they were but flesh, \* and that they were
even a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.\
41 Many a time did they provoke him in the wilderness, \* and grieved
him in the desert.\
42 They turned back, and tempted God, \* and provoked the Holy One in
Israel.\
43 They thought not of his hand, \* and of the day when he delivered
them from the hand of the enemy;\
44 How he had wrought his miracles in Egypt, \* and his wonders in the
field of Zoan.\
45 He turned their waters into blood, \* so that they might not drink of
the rivers.\
46 He sent flies among them, and devoured them up; \* and frogs to
destroy them.\
47 He gave their fruit unto the caterpillar, \* and their labour unto
the grasshopper.\
48 He destroyed their vines with hailstones, \* and their mulberry-trees
with the frost.\
49 He smote their cattle also with hailstones, \* and their flocks with
hot thunderbolts.\
50 He cast upon them the furiousness of his wrath, anger, displeasure,
and trouble: \* and sent evil angels among them.\
51 He made a way to his indignation, and spared not their soul from
death; \* but gave their life over to the pestilence;\
52 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt, \* the most principal and
mightiest in the dwellings of Ham.\
53 But as for his own people, he led them forth like sheep, \* and
carried them in the wilderness like a flock.\
54 He brought them out safely, that they should not fear, \* and
overwhelmed their enemies with the sea.\
55 And brought them within the borders of his sanctuary, \* even to this
mountain, which he purchased with his right hand.\
56 He cast out the heathen also before them, \* caused their land to be
divided among them for an heritage, and made the tribes of Israel to
dwell in their tents.\
57 Yet they tempted and displeased the Most High God, \* and kept not
his testimonies.\
58 They turned their backs, and fell away like their forefathers; \*
starting aside like a broken bow.\
59 For they grieved him with their hill-altars, \* and provoked him to
displeasure with their images.\
60 When God heard this, he was wroth, \* and took sore displeasure at
Israel;\
61 So that he forsook the tabernacle in Shiloh, \* even the tent that he
had pitched among men.\
62 He delivered their power into captivity, \* and their beauty into the
enemy\'s hand\
63 He gave his people over also unto the sword, \* and was wroth with
his inheritance.\
64 The fire consumed their young men, \* and their maidens were not
given in marriage.\
65 Their priests were slain with the sword, \* and there were no widows
to make lamentation.\
66 So the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, \* and like a giant refreshed
with wine.\
67 He drave his enemies backward, \* and put them to a perpetual shame.\
68 He refused the tabernacle of Joseph, \* and chose not the tribe of
Ephraim;\
69 But chose the tribe of Judah, \* even the hill of Sion which he
loved.\
70 And there he built his temple on high, \* and laid the foundation of
it like the ground which he hath made continually.\
71 He chose David also his servant, \* and took him away from the
sheep-folds:\
72 As he was following the ewes with their young he took him, \* that he
might feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.\
73 So he fed them with a faithful and true heart, \* and ruled them
prudently with all his power.\

The Sixteenth Day.\
\
Morning Prayer.

**Psalm 79. Deus, venerunt.**\
O GOD, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; \* thy holy temple
have they defiled, and made Jerusalem an heap of stones.\
2 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the
fowls of the air, \* and the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the
land.\
3 Their blood have they shed like water on every side of Jerusalem, \*
and there was no man to bury them.\
4 We are become an open shame to our enemies, \* a very scorn and
derision unto them that are round about us.\
5 LORD, how long wilt thou be angry? \* shall thy jealousy burn like
fire for ever?\
6 Pour out thine indignation upon the heathen that have not known thee;
\* and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy Name.\
7 For they have devoured Jacob, \* and laid waste his dwelling-place.\
8 O remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and that soon; \*
for we are come to great misery.\
9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name: \* O
deliver us, and be merciful unto our sins, for thy Name\'s sake.\
10 Wherefore do the heathen say, \* Where is now their God?\
11 O let the vengeance of thy servants\' blood that is shed, \* be
openly showed upon the heathen, in our sight.\
12 O let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before thee; \*
according to the greatness of thy power, preserve thou those that are
appointed to die.\
13 And for the blasphemy wherewith our neighbours have blasphemed thee,
\* reward thou them, O Lord, sevenfold into their bosom.\
14 So we, that are thy people, and sheep of thy pasture, shall give thee
thanks for ever, \* and will alway be showing forth thy praise from
generation to generation.\
\
**\
Psalm 80. Qui regis Israel.**\
HEAR, O thou Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock;
\* show thyself also, thou that sittest upon the Cherubim.\
2 Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, \* stir up thy strength, and
come and help us.\
3 Turn us again, O God; \* show the light of thy countenance, and we
shall be whole.\
4 O LORD God of hosts, \* how long wilt thou be angry with thy people
that prayeth?\
5 Thou feedest them with the bread of tears, \* and givest them
plenteousness of tears to drink.\
6 Thou hast made us a very strife unto our neighbours, \* and our
enemies laugh us to scorn.\
7 Turn us again, thou God of hosts; \* show the light of thy
countenance, and we shall be whole.\
8 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt; \* thou hast cast out the
heathen, and planted it.\
9 Thou madest room for it; \* and when it had taken root, it filled the
land.\
10 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, \* and the boughs
thereof were like the goodly cedar-trees.\
11 She stretched out her branches unto the sea, \* and her boughs unto
the River.\
12 Why hast thou then broken down her hedge, \* that all they that go by
pluck off her grapes?\
13 The wild boar out of the wood doth root it up, \* and the wild beasts
of the field devour it.\
14 Turn thee again, thou God of hosts, look down from heaven, \* behold,
and visit this vine;\
15 And the place of the vineyard that thy right hand hath planted, \*
and the branch that thou madest so strong for thyself.\
16 It is burnt with fire, and cut down; \* and they shall perish at the
rebuke of thy countenance.\
17 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, \* and upon the son
of man, whom thou madest so strong for thine own self.\
18 And so will not we go back from thee: \* O let us live, and we shall
call upon thy Name.\
19 Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts; \* show the light of thy
countenance, and we shall be whole.\
\
**\
Psalm 81. Exultate Deo.**\
SING we merrily unto God our strength; \* make a cheerful noise unto the
God of Jacob.\
2 Take the psalm, bring hither the tabret, \* the merry harp with the
lute.\
3 Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, \* even in the time appointed,
and upon our solemn feast-day.\
4 For this was made a statute for Israel, \* and a law of the God of
Jacob.\
5 This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, \* when he came out of the
land of Egypt, and had heard a strange language.\
6 I eased his shoulder from the burden, \* and his hands were delivered
from making the pots.\
7 Thou calledst upon me in troubles, and I delivered thee; \* and heard
thee what time as the storm fell upon thee.\
8 I proved thee also \* at the waters of strife.\
9 Hear, O my people; and I will assure thee, O Israel, \* if thou wilt
hearken unto me,\
10 There shall no strange god be in thee, \* neither shalt thou worship
any other god.\
11 I am the LORD thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt: \*
open thy mouth wide, and I shall fill it.\
12 But my people would not hear my voice; \* and Israel would not obey
me;\
13 So I gave them up unto their own hearts\' lusts, \* and let them
follow their own imaginations.\
14 O that my people would have hearkened unto me! \* for if Israel had
walked in my ways,\
15 I should soon have put down their enemies, \* and turned my hand
against their adversaries.\
16 The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him; \*
but their time should have endured for ever.\
17 I would have fed them also with the finest wheatflour; \* and with
honey out of the stony rock would I have satisfied thee.\

Evening Prayer.

**Psalm 82. Deus stetit.**\
GOD standeth in the congregation of princes; \* he is a Judge among
gods.\
2 How long will ye give wrong judgment, \* and accept the persons of the
ungodly?\
3 Defend the poor and fatherless; \* see that such as are in need and
necessity have right.\
4 Deliver the outcast and poor; \* save them from the hand of the
ungodly.\
5 They know not, neither do they understand, but walk on still in
darkness: \* all the foundations of the earth are out of course.\
6 I have said, Ye are gods, \* and ye are all the children of the Most
Highest.\
7 But ye shall die like men, \* and fall like one of the princes.\
8 Arise, O God, and judge thou the earth; \* for thou shalt take all
nations to thine inheritance.\
\
**\
Psalm 83. Deus, quis similis?**\
HOLD not thy tongue, O God, keep not still silence: \* refrain not
thyself, O God.\
2 For lo, thine enemies make a murmuring; \* and they that hate thee
have lift up their head.\
3 They have imagined craftily against thy people, \* and taken counsel
against thy secret ones.\
4 They have said, Come, and let us root them out, that they be no more a
people, \* and that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.\
5 For they have cast their heads together with one consent, \* and are
confederate against thee:\
6 The tabernacles of the Edomites, and the Ishmaelites; \* the Moabites,
and Hagarenes;\
7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; \* the Philistines, with them that dwell
at Tyre.\
8 Assyria also is joined with them; \* they have holpen the children of
Lot.\
9 But do thou to them as unto the Midianites; \* unto Sisera, and unto
Jabin at the brook of Kishon;\
10 Who perished at Endor, \* and became as the dung of the earth.\
11 Make them and their princes like Oreb and Zeeb; \* yea, make all
their princes like as Zebah and Zalmunna;\
12 Who say, Let us take to ourselves \* the houses of God in
possession.\
13 O my God, make them like unto the whirling dust, \* and as the
stubble before the wind;\
14 Like as the fire that burneth up the forest, \* and as the flame that
consumeth the mountains;\
15 Pursue them even so with thy tempest, \* and make them afraid with
thy storm.\
16 Make their faces ashamed, O LORD, \* that they may seek thy Name.\
17 Let them be confounded and vexed ever more and more; \* let them be
put to shame, and perish.\
18 And they shall know that thou, whose Name is JEHOVAH, \* art only the
Most Highest over all the earth.\
\
**\
Psalm 84. Quam dilecta!**\
O HOW amiable are thy dwellings, \* thou LORD of hosts!\
2 My soul hath a desire and longing to enter into the courts of the
LORD; \* my heart and my flesh rejoice in the living God.\
3 Yea, the sparrow hath found her an house, and the swallow a nest,
where she may lay her young; \* even thy altars, O LORD of hosts, my
King and my God.\
4 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house; \* they will be alway
praising thee.\
5 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; \* in whose heart are
thy ways.\
6 Who going through the vale of misery use it for a well; \* and the
pools are filled with water.\
7 They will go from strength to strength, \* and unto the God of gods
appeareth every one of them in Sion.\
8 O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; \* hearken, O God of Jacob.\
9 Behold, O God our defender, \* and look upon the face of thine
anointed.\
10 For one day in thy courts \* is better than a thousand.\
11 I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God, \* than to
dwell in the tents of ungodliness.\
12 For the LORD God is a light and defence; \* the LORD will give grace
and worship; and no good thing shall he withhold from them that live a
godly life.\
13 O LORD God of hosts, \* blessed is the man that putteth his trust in
thee.\
\
**\
Psalm 85. Benedixisti, Domine.**\
LORD, thou art become gracious unto thy land; \* thou hast turned away
the captivity of Jacob.\
2 Thou hast forgiven the offence of thy people, \* and covered all their
sins.\
3 Thou hast taken away all thy displeasure, \* and turned thyself from
thy wrathful indignation.\
4 Turn us then, O God our Saviour, \* and let thine anger cease from
us.\
5 Wilt thou be displeased at us for ever? \* and wilt thou stretch out
thy wrath from one generation to another?\
6 Wilt thou not turn again, and quicken us, \* that thy people may
rejoice in thee?\
7 Show us thy mercy, O LORD, \* and grant us thy salvation.\
8 I will hearken what the LORD God will say; \* for he shall speak peace
unto his people, and to his saints, that they turn not again unto
foolishness.\
9 For his salvation is nigh them that fear him; \* that glory may dwell
in our land.\
10 Mercy and truth are met together: \* righteousness and peace have
kissed each other.\
11 Truth shall flourish out of the earth, \* and righteousness hath
looked down from heaven.\
12 Yea, the LORD shall show loving-kindness; \* and our land shall give
her increase.\
13 Righteousness shall go before him, \* and shall direct his going in

The Seventeenth Day.\
\
Morning Prayer.

**Psalm 86. Inclina, Domine.**\
BOW down thine ear, O LORD, and hear me; \* for I am poor, and in
misery.\
2 Preserve thou my soul, for I am holy: \* my God, save thy servant that
putteth his trust in thee.\
3 Be merciful unto me, O Lord; \* for I will call daily upon thee.\
4 Comfort the soul of thy servant; \* for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift
up my soul.\
5 For thou, Lord, art good and gracious, \* and of great mercy unto all
them that call upon thee.\
6 Give ear, LORD, unto my prayer, \* and ponder the voice of my humble
desires.\
7 In the time of my trouble I will call upon thee; \* for thou hearest
me.\
8 Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; \* there is not
one that can do as thou doest.\
9 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship thee, O Lord;
\* and shall glorify thy Name.\
10 For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: \* thou art God
alone.\
11 Teach me thy way, O LORD, and I will walk in thy truth: \* O knit my
heart unto thee, that I may fear thy Name.\
12 I will thank thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart; \* and will
praise thy Name for evermore.\
13 For great is thy mercy toward me; \* and thou hast delivered my soul
from the nethermost hell.\
14 O God, the proud are risen against me; \* and the congregations of
violent men have sought after my soul, and have not set thee before
their eyes.\
15 But thou, O Lord God, art full of compassion and mercy, \*
long-suffering, plenteous in goodness and truth.\
16 O turn thee then unto me, and have mercy upon me; \* give thy
strength unto thy servant, and help the son of thine handmaid.\
17 Show some token upon me for good; that they who hate me may see it,
and be ashamed, \* because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted
me.\
\
**\
Psalm 87. Fundamenta ejus.**\
HER foundations are upon the holy hills: \* the LORD loveth the gates of
Sion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.\
2 Very excellent things are spoken of thee, \* thou city of God.\
3 I will make mention of Egypt and Babylon, \* among them that know me.\
4 Behold, Philistia also; and Tyre, with Ethiopia; \* lo, in Sion were
they born.\
5 Yea, of Sion it shall be reported, this one and that one were born in
her; \* and the Most High shall stablish her.\
6 The LORD shall record it, when he writeth up the peoples; \* lo, in
Sion were they born.\
7 The singers also and trumpeters shall make answer: \* All my fresh
springs are in thee.\
\
**\
Psalm 88. Domine, Deus.**\
O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee: \* O
let my prayer enter into thy presence, incline thine ear unto my
calling;\
2 For my soul is full of trouble, \* and my life draweth nigh unto the
grave.\
3 I am counted as one of them that go down into the pit, \* and I am
even as a man that hath no strength;\
4 Cast off among the dead, like unto them that are slain, and lie in the
grave, \* who are out of remembrance, and are cut away from thy hand.\
5 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, \* in a place of darkness, and in
the deep.\
6 Thine indignation lieth hard upon me, \* and thou hast vexed me with
all thy storms.\
7 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me, \* and made me to be
abhorred of them.\
8 I am so fast in prison \* that I cannot get forth.\
9 My sight faileth for very trouble; \* LORD, I have called daily upon
thee, I have stretched forth my hands unto thee.\
10 Dost thou show wonders among the dead? \* or shall the dead rise up
again, and praise thee?\
11 Shall thy loving-kindness be showed in the grave? \* or thy
faithfulness in destruction?\
12 Shall thy wondrous works be known in the dark? \* and thy
righteousness in the land where all things are forgotten?\
13 Unto thee have I cried, O LORD; \* and early shall my prayer come
before thee.\
14 LORD, why abhorrest thou my soul, \* and hidest thou thy face from
me?\
15 I am in misery, and like unto him that is at the point to die; \*
even from my youth up, thy terrors have I suffered with a troubled
mind.\
16 Thy wrathful displeasure goeth over me, \* and the fear of thee hath
undone me.\
17 They came round about me daily like water, \* and compassed me
together on every side.\
18 My lovers and friends hast thou put away from me, \* and hid mine
acquaintance out of my sight.\

Evening Prayer.

**Psalm 89. Misericordias Domini**.\
MY song shall be alway of the loving-kindness of the LORD; \* with my
mouth will I ever be showing thy truth from one generation to another.\
2 For I have said, Mercy shall be set up for ever; \* thy truth shalt
thou stablish in the heavens.\
3 I have made a covenant with my chosen; \* I have sworn unto David my
servant:\
4 Thy seed will I stablish for ever, \* and set up thy throne from one
generation to another.\
5 O LORD, the very heavens shall praise thy wondrous works; \* and thy
truth in the congregation of the saints.\
6 For who is he among the clouds, \* that shall be compared unto the
LORD?\
7 And what is he among the gods, \* that shall be like unto the LORD?\
8 God is very greatly to be feared in the council of the saints, \* and
to be had in reverence of all them that are round about him.\
9 O Lord God of hosts, who is like unto thee? \* thy truth, most mighty
LORD, is on every side.\
10 Thou rulest the raging of the sea; \* thou stillest the waves thereof
when they arise.\
11 Thou hast subdued Egypt, and destroyed it; \* thou hast scattered
thine enemies abroad with thy mighty arm.\
12 The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine; \* thou hast laid the
foundation of the round world, and all that therein is.\
13 Thou hast made the north and the south; \* Tabor and Hermon shall
rejoice in thy Name.\
14 Thou hast a mighty arm; \* strong is thy hand, and high is thy right
hand.\
15 Righteousness and equity are the habitation of thy seat; \* mercy and
truth shall go before thy face.\
16 Blessed is the people, O LORD, that can rejoice in thee; \* they
shall walk in the light of thy countenance.\
17 Their delight shall be daily in thy Name; \* and in thy righteousness
shall they make their boast.\
18 For thou art the glory of their strength, \* and in thy
loving-kindness thou shalt lift up our horns.\
19 For the LORD is our defence; \* the Holy One of Israel is our King.\
20 Thou spakest sometime in visions unto thy saints, and saidst, \* I
have laid help upon one that is mighty, I have exalted one chosen out of
the people.\
21 I have found David my servant; \* with my holy oil have I anointed
him.\
22 My hand shall hold him fast, \* and my arm shall strengthen him.\
23 The enemy shall not be able to do him violence; \* the son of
wickedness shall not hurt him.\
24 I will smite down his foes before his face, \* and plague them that
hate him.\
25 My truth also and my mercy shall be with him; \* and in my Name shall
his horn be exalted.\
26 I will set his dominion also in the sea, \* and his right hand in the
floods.\
27 He shall call me, Thou art my Father, \* my God, and my strong
salvation.\
28 And I will make him my firstborn, \* higher than the kings of the
earth.\
29 My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, \* and my covenant shall
stand fast with him.\
30 His seed also will I make to endure for ever, \* and his throne as
the days of heaven.\
31 But if his children forsake my law, \* and walk not in my judgments;\
32 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; \* I will
visit their offences with the rod, and their sin with scourges.\
33 Nevertheless, my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from him, \*
nor suffer my truth to fail.\
34 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of
my lips: \* I have sworn once by my holiness, that I will not fail
David.\
35 His seed shall endure for ever, \* and his throne is like as the sun
before me.\
36 He shall stand fast for evermore as the moon, \* and as the faithful
witness in heaven.\
37 But thou hast abhorred and forsaken thine anointed, \* and art
displeased at him.\
38 Thou hast broken the covenant of thy servant, \* and cast his crown
to the ground.\
39 Thou hast overthrown all his hedges, \* and broken down his
strongholds.\
40 All they that go by spoil him, \* and he is become a reproach to his
neighbours.\
41 Thou hast set up the right hand of his enemies, \* and made all his
adversaries to rejoice.\
42 Thou hast taken away the edge of his sword, \* and givest him not
victory in the battle.\
43 Thou hast put out his glory, \* and cast his throne down to the
ground.\
44 The days of his youth hast thou shortened, \* and covered him with
dishonour.\
45 LORD, how long wilt thou hide thyself? for ever? \* and shall thy
wrath burn like fire?\
46 O remember how short my time is; \* wherefore hast thou made all men
for nought?\
47 What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? \* and shall he
deliver his soul from the power of the grave?\
48 Lord, where are thy old loving-kindnesses, \* which thou swarest unto
David in thy truth?\
49 Remember, Lord, the rebuke that thy servants have, \* and how I do
bear in my bosom the rebukes of many people;\
50 Wherewith thine enemies have blasphemed thee, \* and slandered the
footsteps of thine anointed.\
51 Praised be the LORD for evermore. \* Amen, and Amen.\
