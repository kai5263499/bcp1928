| Ruth 1:1-17**\                                                        |
| 1 Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there   |
| was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem-judah went   |
| to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two      |
| sons.\                                                                |
| 2 And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife     |
| Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites   |
| of Bethlehem-judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and       |
| continued there.\                                                     |
| 3 And Elimelech Naomi\'s husband died; and she was left, and her two  |
| sons.\                                                                |
| 4 And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one  |
| was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there     |
| about ten years.\                                                     |
| 5 And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was    |
| left of her two sons and her husband.\                                |
| 6 Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return     |
| from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab    |
| how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.\       |
| 7 Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her    |
| two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return     |
| unto the land of Judah.\                                              |
| 8 And Naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each to    |
| her mother\'s house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt  |
| with the dead, and with me.\                                          |
| 9 The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house  |
| of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, |
| and wept.\                                                            |
| 10 And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy   |
| people.\                                                              |
| 11 And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me?  |
| are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your         |
| husbands?\                                                            |
| 12 Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an |
| husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband    |
| also tonight, and should also bear sons;\                             |
| 13 Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for    |
| them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much |
| for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.\     |
| 14 And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed   |
| her mother-in-law; but Ruth clave unto her.\                          |
| 15 And she said, Behold, thy sister-in-law is gone back unto her      |
| people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister-in-law.\      |
| 16 And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from     |
| following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where    |
| thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy    |
| God my God:\                                                          |
| 17 Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD |
| do so to me, and more also, if aught but death part thee and me.\     |
| \                                                                     |
| **Second Lesson\                                                      |
| Colossians 3:5-11**\                                                  |
| 5 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth;            |
| fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence,   |
| and covetousness, which is idolatry:\                                 |
| 6 For which things\' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of  |
| disobedience:\                                                        |
| 7 In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.\      |
| 8 But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, |
| filthy communication out of your mouth.\                              |
| 9 Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man     |
| with his deeds;\                                                      |
| 10 And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after   |
| the image of him that created him:\                                   |
| 11 Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor             |
| uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is     |

| 9 Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the       |
| mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up:\      |
| 10 Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning hooks into      |
| spears: let the weak say, I am strong.\                               |
| 11 Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather          |
| yourselves together round about: thither cause thy mighty ones to     |
| come down, O LORD.\                                                   |
| 12 Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of           |
| Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round      |
| about.\                                                               |
| 13 Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down; |
| for the press is full, the vats overflow; for their wickedness is     |
| great.\                                                               |
| 14 Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of   |
| the LORD is near in the valley of decision.\                          |
| 15 The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall        |
| withdraw their shining.\                                              |
| 16 The LORD also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from     |
| Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the LORD    |
| will be the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of   |

| **Second Lesson\                                                      |
| Matthew 13:36-52**\                                                   |
| 36 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and   |
| his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of   |
| the tares of the field.\                                              |
| 37 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is    |
| the Son of man;\                                                      |
| 38 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the      |
| kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;\           |
| 39 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of  |
| the world; and the reapers are the angels.\                           |
| 40 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so     |
| shall it be in the end of this world.\                                |
| 41 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather  |
| out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do          |
| iniquity;\                                                            |
| 42 And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing |
| and gnashing of teeth.\                                               |
| 43 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of  |
| their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.\                   |
| 44 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; |
| the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth |
| and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.\                 |
| 45 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking  |
| goodly pearls:\                                                       |
| 46 Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all |
| that he had, and bought it.\                                          |
| 47 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast     |
| into the sea, and gathered of every kind:\                            |
| 48 Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and     |
| gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.\               |
| 49 So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come      |
| forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,\                     |
| 50 And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be       |
| wailing and gnashing of teeth.\                                       |
| 51 Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They   |
| say unto him, Yea, Lord.\                                             |
| 52 Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed |
| unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, |
| which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.\         |

| 1 The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning Edom; We  |
| have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent among    |
| the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.\     |
| 2 Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art greatly  |
| despised.\                                                            |
| 3 The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in  |
| the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his   |
| heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?\                        |
| 4 Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy     |
| nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the LORD.\ |
| 5 If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut     |
| off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the         |
| grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some grapes?\       |
| 6 How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden things  |
| sought up!\                                                           |
| 7 All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the        |
| border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and  |
| prevailed against thee; they that eat thy bread have laid a wound     |
| under thee: there is none understanding in him.\                      |
| 8 Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD, even destroy the wise men  |
| out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?\             |
| 9 And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that     |
| every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter.\          |

| 1 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered       |
| throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,\          |
| 2 Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through     |
| sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the    |
| blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.\     |
| 3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which       |
| according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively  |
| hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,\              |
| 4 To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not |
| away, reserved in heaven for you,\                                    |

| to be revealed in the last time.\                                     |
| 6 Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye |
| are in heaviness through manifold temptations:\                       |
| 7 That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold |
| that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto     |
| praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:\        |
| 8 Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not,  |
| yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:\    |
| 9 Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.\ |
| 10 Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched         |
| diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:\   |
| 11 Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which  |
| was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings  |
| of Christ, and the glory that should follow.\                         |
| 12 Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us   |
| they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them |

| Deuteronomy 24:10-18**\                                               |
| 10 When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go into  |
| his house to fetch his pledge.\                                       |
| 11 Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall  |
| bring out the pledge abroad unto thee.\                               |
| 12 And if the man be poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge:\     |
| 13 In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun   |
| goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless thee: and |
| it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God.\         |
| 14 Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy,    |
| whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that are in thy    |
| land within thy gates:\                                               |
| 15 At his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go  |
| down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he  |
| cry against thee unto the LORD, and it be sin unto thee.\             |
| 16 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither    |
| shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall   |
| be put to death for his own sin.\                                     |
| 17 Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of the    |
| fatherless; nor take a widow\'s raiment to pledge:\                   |
| 18 But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the |
| LORD thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command thee to do     |
| this thing.\                                                          |
| \                                                                     |
| **Second Lesson\                                                      |
| 1 Thessalonians 1**\                                                  |
| 1 Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the           |
| Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus        |
| Christ: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the    |
| Lord Jesus Christ.\                                                   |
| 2 We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in  |
| our prayers;\                                                         |
| 3 Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, |
| and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God    |
| and our Father;\                                                      |
| 4 Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.\                   |
| 5 For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power,   |
| and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner  |
| of men we were among you for your sake.\                              |
| 6 And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the |
| word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost:\                 |
| 7 So that ye were examples to all that believe in Macedonia and       |
| Achaia.\                                                              |
| 8 For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia |
| and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread  |
| abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.\                      |
| 9 For they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had    |
| unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and |
| true God;\                                                            |
| 10 And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, |
| even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.\               |

| First Lesson\                                                         |
| Obadiah 10-21**\                                                      |
| 10 For thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee, |
| and thou shalt be cut off for ever.\                                  |
| 11 In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that   |
| the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered |
| into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one   |
| of them.\                                                             |
| 12 But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in    |
| the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have        |
| rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction;  |
| neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress.\   |
| 13 Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the  |
| day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked on their   |
| affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their |
| substance in the day of their calamity;\                              |
| 14 Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off      |
| those of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have delivered   |
| up those of his that did remain in the day of distress.\              |
| 15 For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as thou hast |
| done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine  |
| own head.\                                                            |
| 16 For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the       |
| heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall      |
| swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been.\         |
| 17 But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be       |
| holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.\    |
| 18 And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a  |
| flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in    |
| them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the    |
| house of Esau; for the LORD hath spoken it.\                          |
| 19 And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and they of |
| the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the fields of       |
| Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin shall possess        |
| Gilead.\                                                              |
| 20 And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel shall     |
| possess that of the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath; and the          |
| captivity of Jerusalem, which is in Sepharad, shall possess the       |
| cities of the south.\                                                 |
| 21 And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of     |
| Esau; and the kingdom shall be the LORD\'S.\                          |

| 1 Peter 1:13-25**\                                                    |
| 13 Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to    |
| the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the           |
| revelation of Jesus Christ;\                                          |
| 14 As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the   |
| former lusts in your ignorance:\                                      |
| 15 But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all      |
| manner of conversation;\                                              |
| 16 Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.\                 |
| 17 And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons       |
| judgeth according to every man\'s work, pass the time of your         |
| sojourning here in fear:\                                             |
| 18 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible    |
| things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by   |
| tradition from your fathers;\                                         |
| 19 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without        |
| blemish and without spot:\                                            |
| 20 Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world,    |
| but was manifest in these last times for you,\                        |
| 21 Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead,    |
| and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.\        |
| 22 Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through    |
| the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one  |
| another with a pure heart fervently:\                                 |
| 23 Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible,   |
| by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.\               |
| 24 For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower  |
| of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:\  |
| 25 But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word   |
| which by the gospel is preached unto you.\                            |

| Deuteronomy 25:1-3, 13-16**\                                          |
| 1 If there be a controversy between men, and they come unto judgment, |
| that the judges may judge them; then they shall justify the           |
| righteous, and condemn the wicked.\                                   |
| 2 And it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that the |
| judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face,  |
| according to his fault, by a certain number.\                         |
| 3 Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed: lest, if he should   |
| exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then thy brother  |
| should seem vile unto thee.\                                          |
| 13 Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a       |
| small.\                                                               |
| 14 Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, a great and a  |
| small.\                                                               |
| 15 But thou shalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and just  |
| measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be lengthened in the land  |
| which the LORD thy God giveth thee.\                                  |
| 16 For all that do such things, and all that do unrighteously, are an |

| Second Lesson\                                                        |
| 1 Thessalonians 2:1-16**\                                             |
| 1 For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it    |
| was not in vain:\                                                     |
| 2 But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully     |
| entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak  |
| unto you the gospel of God with much contention.\                     |
| 3 For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in   |
| guile:\                                                               |
| 4 But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel,   |
| even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our      |
| hearts.\                                                              |
| 5 For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a |
| cloak of covetousness; God is witness:\                               |
| 6 Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when |
| we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.\            |
| 7 But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her        |
| children:\                                                            |
| 8 So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have    |
| imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own       |
| souls, because ye were dear unto us.\                                 |
| 9 For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring    |
| night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we |
| preached unto you the gospel of God.\                                 |
| 10 Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and          |
| unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:\             |
| 11 As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of  |
| you, as a father doth his children,\                                  |
| 12 That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his     |
| kingdom and glory.\                                                   |
| 13 For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye |
| received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as  |
| the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which        |
| effectually worketh also in you that believe.\                        |
| 14 For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in |
| Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of  |
| your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:\                  |
| 15 Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have   |
| persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:\ |
| 16 Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved,   |
| to fill up their sins always: for the wrath is come upon them to the  |
| uttermost.\                                                           |

| 6 A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be  |
| a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my     |

| and envies, and all evil speakings,\                                  |
| 2 As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may  |

| 4 To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men,   |
| but chosen of God, and precious,\                                     |
| 5 Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy  |
| priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by    |
| Jesus Christ.\                                                        |

| Zion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on  |
| him shall not be confounded.\                                         |
| 7 Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them      |
| which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the    |
| same is made the head of the corner,\                                 |

| stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were      |

| 4 And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand, and set it  |
| down before the altar of the LORD thy God.\                           |
| 5 And thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy God, A Syrian      |

| signs, and with wonders:\                                             |
| 9 And he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this      |
| land, even a land that floweth with milk and honey.\                  |
| 10 And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land, which |
| thou, O LORD, hast given me. And thou shalt set it before the LORD    |
| thy God, and worship before the LORD thy God:\                        |
| 11 And thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the LORD thy God  |

| 17 But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in         |

| face with great desire.\                                              |
| 18 Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and       |
| again; but Satan hindered us.\                                        |
| 19 For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even  |
| ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?\           |
| 20 For ye are our glory and joy.\                                     |
| 1 Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be |
| left at Athens alone;\                                                |
| 2 And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our       |
| fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to      |
| comfort you concerning your faith:\                                   |
| 3 That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves    |
| know that we are appointed thereunto.\                                |
| 4 For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we       |
| should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.\     |
| 5 For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your |
| faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our       |
| labour be in vain.\                                                   |
| 6 But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good   |
| tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance  |
| of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:\     |
| 7 Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our          |
| affliction and distress by your faith:\                               |
| 8 For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.\                     |
| 9 For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy |
| wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;\                      |
| 10 Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and |
| might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?\                   |
| 11 Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct  |
| our way unto you.\                                                    |
| 12 And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward    |
| another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:\               |
| 13 To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness     |
| before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ   |
| with all his saints.\                                                 |

| 1 And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you.\                |
| 2 If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give    |
| glory unto my name, saith the LORD of hosts, I will even send a curse |
| upon you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I have cursed them    |
| already, because ye do not lay it to heart.\                          |
| 3 Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces,  |
| even the dung of your solemn feasts; and one shall take you away with |
| it.\                                                                  |
| 4 And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that  |
| my covenant might be with Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.\             |
| 5 My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him  |
| for the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name.\  |
| 6 The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in    |
| his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many    |
| away from iniquity.\                                                  |
| 7 For the priest\'s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek  |
| the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.\  |
| 8 But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble  |
| at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the LORD of |

| people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial  |
| in the law.\                                                          |

| work with your own hands, as we commanded you;\                       |
| 12 That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that   |

| 1 Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way      |
| before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his     |
| temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in:       |
| behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts.\                      |
| 2 But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when   |
| he appeareth? for he is like a refiner\'s fire, and like fullers\'    |
| soap:\                                                                |
| 3 And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall  |
| purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they |
| may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.\                |
| 4 Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the |
| LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years.\                 |
| 5 And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift      |
| witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and        |
| against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling   |
| in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the  |
| stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts.\   |
| 6 For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not |
| consumed.\                                                            |
| 7 Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine       |
| ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return |
| unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we      |
| return?\                                                              |

| 10 Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be     |
| meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of      |
| hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out |
| a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.\       |
| 11 And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not    |
| destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her   |
| fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts.\         |
| 12 And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a          |
| delightsome land, saith the LORD of hosts.\                           |
| 13 Your words have been stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, |
| What have we spoken so much against thee?\                            |
| 14 Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that  |

| the good and gentle, but also to the froward.\                        |
| 19 For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure |

| 20 For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye  |
| shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it,  |
| ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.\                   |
| 21 For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for |
| us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:\          |
| 22 Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:\             |
| 23 Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he  |

| 2 And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have seen  |

| Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land;\           |
| 9 Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may |
| prosper in all that ye do.\                                           |

| into his oath, which the LORD thy God maketh with thee this day:\     |
| 13 That he may establish thee today for a people unto himself, and    |
| that he may be unto thee a God, as he hath said unto thee, and as he  |
| hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.\     |
| 14 Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath;\      |
| 15 But with him that standeth here with us this day before the LORD   |
| our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day:\        |
| 16 (For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we    |
| came through the nations which ye passed by;\                         |
| 17 And ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and     |

| 1 Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if |
| any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the   |
| conversation of the wives;\                                           |
| 2 While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.\      |
| 3 Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the  |
| hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;\           |
| 4 But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not     |
| corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is   |
| in the sight of God of great price.\                                  |
| 5 For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who      |
| trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their    |
| own husbands:\                                                        |
| 6 Even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye  |
| are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.\   |
| 7 Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge,      |
| giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being  |
| heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not         |
| hindered.\                                                            |

| contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye  |
| should inherit a blessing.\                                           |
| 10 For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his |

| 11 Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue    |
| it.\                                                                  |

| First Lesson\                                                         |
| Deuteronomy 30:11-20**\                                               |
| 11 For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not      |
| hidden from thee, neither is it far off.\                             |
| 12 It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for  |
| us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?\  |
| 13 Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall   |
| go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it,    |
| and do it?\                                                           |
| 14 But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy      |
| heart, that thou mayest do it.\                                       |
| 15 See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and  |
| evil;\                                                                |
| 16 In that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God, to walk  |
| in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his    |
| judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and the LORD thy God   |
| shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it.\       |
| 17 But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but      |
| shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;\         |
| 18 I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and     |
| that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou       |
| passest over Jordan to go to possess it.\                             |
| 19 I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I     |
| have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore   |
| choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:\                   |
| 20 That thou mayest love the LORD thy God, and that thou mayest obey  |
| his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he is thy life,  |
| and the length of thy days: that thou mayest dwell in the land which  |
| the LORD sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob,  |
| to give them.\                                                        |
| \                                                                     |
| \                                                                     |
| **Second Lesson\                                                      |
| 1 Thessalonians 5:1-11**\                                             |
| 1 But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I  |
| write unto you.\                                                      |
| 2 For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as |
| a thief in the night.\                                                |
| 3 For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction  |
| cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall  |
| not escape.\                                                          |
| 4 But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should         |
| overtake you as a thief.\                                             |
| 5 Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we   |
| are not of the night, nor of darkness.\                               |
| 6 Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be   |
| sober.\                                                               |
| 7 For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken    |
| are drunken in the night.\                                            |
| 8 But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the            |
| breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of         |
| salvation.\                                                           |
| 9 For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by  |
| our Lord Jesus Christ,\                                               |
| 10 Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live    |
| together with him.\                                                   |
| 11 Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even |
| as also ye do.                                                        |
|                                                                       |
