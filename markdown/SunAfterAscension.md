| 1 These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and      |
| said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also    |
| may glorify thee:\                                                    |
| 2 As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give    |
| eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.\                      |
| 3 And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true   |
| God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.\                          |
| 4 I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which  |
| thou gavest me to do.\                                                |
| 5 And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the     |
| glory which I had with thee before the world was.\                    |
| 6 I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of |
| the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have    |
| kept thy word.\                                                       |
| 7 Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me   |
| are of thee.\                                                         |
| 8 For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they |
| have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee,  |
| and they have believed that thou didst send me.\                      |
| 9 I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou  |
| hast given me; for they are thine.\                                   |
| 10 And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in  |
| them.\                                                                |
| 11 And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and |
| I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom   |
| thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.\                 |
| 12 While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those |
| that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the    |
| son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.\             |
| 13 And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world,     |
| that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.\                 |
| 14 I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because |
| they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.\            |
| 15 I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but     |
| that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.\                         |
| 16 They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.\         |
| 17 Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.\               |
| 18 As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them |
| into the world.\                                                      |
| 19 And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be     |
| sanctified through the truth.\                                        |
| 20 Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall      |
| believe on me through their word;\                                    |
| 21 That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in     |
| thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe     |
| that thou hast sent me.\                                              |
| 22 And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they    |
| may be one, even as we are one:\                                      |
| 23 I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one;   |
| and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved    |
| them, as thou hast loved me.\                                         |
| 24 Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me |
| where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me:  |
| for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.\              |
| 25 O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have      |
| known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.\             |
| 26 And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that  |
| the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.\ |

| 1 O GOD of my fathers, and Lord of mercy, who hast made all things    |
| with thy word,\                                                       |
| 2 And ordained man through thy wisdom, that he should have dominion   |
| over the creatures which thou hast made,\                             |
| 3 And order the world according to equity and righteousness, and      |
| execute judgment with an upright heart:\                              |
| 4 Give me wisdom, that sitteth by thy throne; and reject me not from  |
| among thy children:\                                                  |
| 5 For I thy servant and son of thine handmaid am a feeble person, and |
| of a short time, and too young for the understanding of judgment and  |
| laws.\                                                                |
| 6 For though a man be never so perfect among the children of men, yet |
| if thy wisdom be not with him, he shall be nothing regarded.\         |
| 7 Thou hast chosen me to be a king of thy people, and a judge of thy  |
| sons and daughters\                                                   |
| 8 Thou hast commanded me to build a temple upon thy holy mount and an |
| altar in the city wherein thou dwellest, a resemblance of the holy    |
| tabernacle, which thou hast prepared from the beginning.\             |
| 9 And wisdom was with thee: which knoweth thy works, and was present  |
| when thou madest the world, and knew what was acceptable in thy       |
| sight, and right in thy commandments.\                                |
| 10 O send her out of thy holy heavens, and from the throne of thy     |
| glory, that being present she may labour with me, that I may know     |
| what is pleasing unto thee.\                                          |
| 11 For she knoweth and understandeth all things, and she shall lead   |
| me soberly in my doings, and preserve me in her power.\               |
| 12 So shall my works be acceptable, and then shall I judge thy people |
| righteously, and be worthy to sit in my father\'s seat.\              |
| 13 For what man is he that can know the counsel of God? or who can    |
| think what the will of the Lord is?\                                  |
| 14 For the thoughts of mortal men are miserable, and our devices are  |
| but uncertain.\                                                       |
| 15 For the corruptible body presseth down the soul, and the earthy    |
| tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth upon many things.\      |
| 16 And hardly do we guess aright at things that are upon earth, and   |
| with labour do we find the things that are before us: but the things  |
| that are in heaven who hath searched out?\                            |
| 17 And thy counsel who hath known, except thou give wisdom, and send  |
| thy Holy Spirit from above?\                                          |
| 18 For so the ways of them which lived on the earth were reformed,    |
| and men were taught the things that are pleasing unto thee, and were  |
| saved through wisdom.\                                                |

| that hath many children is waxed feeble.\                             |

| 10 The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of      |

| 1 And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book    |
| written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.\         |
| 2 And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is      |
| worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?\             |
| 3 And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was    |
| able to open the book, neither to look thereon.\                      |
| 4 And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to     |
| read the book, neither to look thereon.\                              |
| 5 And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of  |
| the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the     |
| book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.\                          |
| 6 And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four   |
| beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been   |
| slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits |
| of God sent forth into all the earth.\                                |
| 7 And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat |
| upon the throne.\                                                     |
| 8 And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty |
| elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and |
| golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints.\        |
| 9 And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, |
| and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed |
| us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people,  |
| and nation;\                                                          |

| reign on the earth.\                                                  |
| 11 And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the |
| throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten  |
| thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;\             |
| 12 Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to     |
| receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and  |
| glory, and blessing.\                                                 |
| 13 And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under |
| the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them,      |
| heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto   |
| him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and      |

| 22 Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man       |
| approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which    |
| God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:\      |
| 23 Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge  |
| of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:\ |
| 24 Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because |
| it was not possible that he should be holden of it.\                  |
| 25 For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always       |
| before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be      |
| moved:\                                                               |
| 26 Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover   |
| also my flesh shall rest in hope:\                                    |
| 27 Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou     |
| suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.\                             |
| 28 Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me    |
| full of joy with thy countenance.\                                    |
| 29 Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch    |
| David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us  |
| unto this day.\                                                       |
| 30 Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an  |
| oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh,  |
| he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;\                       |
| 31 He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that    |
| his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.\ |
| 32 This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.\      |
| 33 Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having       |
| received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed    |
| forth this, which ye now see and hear.\                               |
| 34 For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself,  |
| The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,\               |
| 35 Until I make thy foes thy footstool.\                              |
| 36 Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God     |
| hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and      |
| Christ.\                                                              |

| 10 Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by |
| the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God     |
| raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you |
| whole.\                                                               |

| is become the head of the corner.\                                    |

| and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain.\             |

| there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities:\         |
| 21 And the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, Let   |
