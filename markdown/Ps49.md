| \                                                                     |
|                                                                       |
| **Psalms 49. Audite haec, omnes.**\                                   |
| O HEAR ye this, all ye people; \* ponder it with your ears, all ye    |
| that dwell in the world;\                                             |
| 2 High and low, rich and poor, \* one with another.\                  |
| 3 My mouth shall speak of wisdom, \* and my heart shall muse of       |
| understanding.\                                                       |
| 4 I will incline mine ear to the parable, \* and show my dark speech  |
| upon the harp.\                                                       |
| 5 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, \* when wickedness at  |
| my heels compasseth me round about?\                                  |
| 6 There be some that put their trust in their goods, \* and boast     |
| themselves in the multitude of their riches.\                         |
| 7 But no man may deliver his brother, \* nor give a ransom unto God   |
| for him,\                                                             |
| 8 (For it cost more to redeem their souls, \* so that he must let     |
| that alone for ever;)\                                                |
| 9 That he shall live alway, \* and not see the grave.\                |
| 10 For he seeth that wise men also die and perish together, \* as     |
| well as the ignorant and foolish, and leave their riches for other.\  |
| 11 And yet they think that their houses shall continue for ever, and  |
| that their dwelling-places shall endure from one generation to        |
| another; \* and call the lands after their own names.\                |
| 12 Nevertheless, man being in honour abideth not, \* seeing he may be |
| compared unto the beasts that perish;\                                |
| 13 This their way is very foolishness; \* yet their posterity praise  |
| their saying.\                                                        |
| 14 They lie in the grave like sheep; death is their shepherd; and the |
| righteous shall have dominion over them in the morning: \* their      |
| beauty shall consume in the sepulchre, and have no abiding.\          |
| 15 But God hath delivered my soul from the power of the grave; \* for |
| he shall receive me.\                                                 |
| 16 Be not thou afraid, though one be made rich, \* or if the glory of |
| his house be increased;\                                              |
| 17 For he shall carry nothing away with him when he dieth, \* neither |
| shall his pomp follow him.\                                           |
| 18 For while he lived, he counted himself an happy man; \* and so     |
| long as thou doest well unto thyself, men will speak good of thee.\   |
| 19 He shall follow the generation of his fathers, \* and shall never  |
| see light.\                                                           |
| 20 Man that is in honour but hath no understanding \* is compared     |
| unto the beasts that perish.                                          |
