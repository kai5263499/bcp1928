| brother had not died.\                                                |

| 24 Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the      |
| resurrection at the last day.\                                        |
| 25 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that  |
| believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:\             |
| 26 And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.          |
| Believest thou this?\                                                 |
| 27 She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, |
| the Son of God, which should come into the world.\                    |
| 28 And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her    |
| sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.\   |
| 29 As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.\  |
| 30 Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place    |
| where Martha met him.\                                                |
| 31 The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, |
| when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed   |
| her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.\                 |

| which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,\     |
| 34 And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come   |
| and see.\                                                             |

| 37 And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes   |
| of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?\   |
| 38 Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It  |
| was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.\                                 |
| 39 Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that |
| was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath |
| been dead four days.\                                                 |
| 40 Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest |
| believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?\                        |
| 41 Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was    |
| laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee    |
| that thou hast heard me.\                                             |

| graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith |

| When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a  |

| lifted up his hand against the king.\                                 |

| twelve pieces:\                                                       |
| 31 And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the  |
| LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the   |
| hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:\                   |

| it unto thee, even ten tribes.\                                       |
