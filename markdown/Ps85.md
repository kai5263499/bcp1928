| **Psalm 85. Benedixisti, Domine.**\                                   |
| LORD, thou art become gracious unto thy land; \* thou hast turned     |
| away the captivity of Jacob.\                                         |
| 2 Thou hast forgiven the offence of thy people, \* and covered all    |
| their sins.\                                                          |
| 3 Thou hast taken away all thy displeasure, \* and turned thyself     |
| from thy wrathful indignation.\                                       |
| 4 Turn us then, O God our Saviour, \* and let thine anger cease from  |
| us.\                                                                  |
| 5 Wilt thou be displeased at us for ever? \* and wilt thou stretch    |
| out thy wrath from one generation to another?\                        |
| 6 Wilt thou not turn again, and quicken us, \* that thy people may    |
| rejoice in thee?\                                                     |
| 7 Show us thy mercy, O LORD, \* and grant us thy salvation.\          |
| 8 I will hearken what the LORD God will say; \* for he shall speak    |
| peace unto his people, and to his saints, that they turn not again    |
| unto foolishness.\                                                    |
| 9 For his salvation is nigh them that fear him; \* that glory may     |
| dwell in our land.\                                                   |
| 10 Mercy and truth are met together: \* righteousness and peace have  |
| kissed each other.\                                                   |
| 11 Truth shall flourish out of the earth, \* and righteousness hath   |
| looked down from heaven.\                                             |
| 12 Yea, the LORD shall show loving-kindness; \* and our land shall    |
| give her increase.\                                                   |
| 13 Righteousness shall go before him, \* and shall direct his going   |
| in the way.                                                           |
