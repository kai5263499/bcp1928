| **Psalms 30. Exaltabo te, Domine.**\                                  |
| I WILL magnify thee, O LORD; for thou hast set me up, \* and not made |
| my foes to triumph over me.\                                          |
| 2 O LORD my God, I cried unto thee; \* and thou hast healed me.\      |
| 3 Thou, LORD, hast brought my soul out of hell: \* thou hast kept my  |
| life, that I should not go down into the pit.\                        |
| 4 Sing praises unto the LORD, O ye saints of his; \* and give thanks  |
| unto him, for a remembrance of his holiness.\                         |
| 5 For his wrath endureth but the twinkling of an eye, and in his      |
| pleasure is life; \* heaviness may endure for a night, but joy cometh |
| in the morning.\                                                      |
| 6 And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be removed: \* thou,     |
| LORD, of thy goodness, hast made my hill so strong.\                  |
| 7 Thou didst turn thy face from me, \* and I was troubled.\           |
| 8 Then cried I unto thee, O LORD; \* and gat me to my LORD right      |
| humbly.\                                                              |
| 9 What profit is there in my blood, \* when I go down into the pit?\  |
| 10 Shall the dust give thanks unto thee? \* or shall it declare thy   |
| truth?\                                                               |
| 11 Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me; \* LORD, be thou my helper.\ |
| 12 Thou hast turned my heaviness into joy; \* thou hast put off my    |
| sackcloth, and girded me with gladness:\                              |
| 13 Therefore shall every good man sing of thy praise without ceasing. |
| \* O my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.                   |
