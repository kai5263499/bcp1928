**Psalm 119. (Cont)\
X. Manus tuae fecerunt me.**\
THY hands have made me and fashioned me: \* O give me understanding,
that I may learn thy commandments.\
74 They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; \* because I have
put my trust in thy word.\
75 I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, \* and that thou of
very faithfulness hast caused me to be troubled.\
76 O let thy merciful kindness be my comfort, \* according to thy word
unto thy servant.\
77 O let thy loving mercies come unto me, that I may live; \* for thy
law is my delight.\
78 Let the proud be confounded, for they go wickedly about to destroy
me; \* but I will be occupied in thy commandments.\
79 Let such as fear thee, and have known thy testimonies, \* be turned
unto me.\
80 O let my heart be sound in thy statutes, \* that I be not ashamed.\

**XI. Defecit anima mea.**\
MY soul hath longed for thy salvation, \* and I have a good hope because
of thy word.\
82 Mine eyes-long sore for thy word; \* saying, O when wilt thou comfort
me?\
83 For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; \* yet do I not forget
thy statutes.\
84 How many are the days of thy servant? \* when wilt thou be avenged of
them that persecute me?\
85 The proud have digged pits for me, \* which are not after thy law.\
86 All thy commandments are true: \* they persecute me falsely; O be
thou my help.\
87 They had almost made an end of me upon earth; \* but I forsook not
thy commandments.\
88 O quicken me after thy loving-kindness; \* and so shall I keep the
testimonies of thy mouth.\

**XII. In aeternum, Domine.**\
O LORD, thy word \* endureth for ever in heaven. go Thy truth also
remaineth from one generation to another; \* thou hast laid the
foundation of the earth, and it abideth.\
91 They continue this day according to thine ordinance; \* for all
things serve thee.\
92 If my delight had not been in thy law, \* I should have perished in
my trouble.\
93 I will never forget thy commandments; \* for with them thou hast
quickened me.\
94 I am thine: O save me, \* for I have sought thy commandments.\
95 The ungodly laid wait for me, to destroy me; \* but I will consider
thy testimonies.\
96 I see that all things come to an end; \* but thy commandment is
exceeding broad.\

**XIII. Quomodo dilexi!**\
LORD, what love have I unto thy law! \* all the day long is my study in
it.\
98 Thou, through thy commandments, hast made me wiser than mine enemies;
\* for they are ever with me.\
99 I have more understanding than my teachers; \* for thy testimonies
are my study.\
100 I am wiser than the aged; \* because I keep thy commandments.\
101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, \* that I may keep thy
word.\
102 I have not shrunk from thy judgments; \* for thou teachest me.\
103 O how sweet are thy words unto my throat; \* yea, sweeter than honey
unto my mouth!\
104 Through thy commandments I get understanding: \* therefore I hate
all evil ways.
