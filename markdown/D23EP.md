**Psalm 114. In exitu Israel.**\
WHEN Israel came out of Egypt, \* and the house of Jacob from among the
strange people,\
2 Judah was his sanctuary, \* and Israel his dominion.\
3 The sea saw that, and fled; \* Jordan was driven back.\
4 The mountains skipped like rams, \* and the little hills like young
sheep.\
5 What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? \* and thou Jordan,
that thou wast driven back?\
6 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams? \* and ye little hills, like
young sheep?\
7 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord: \* at the presence
of the God of Jacob;\
8 Who turned the hard rock into a standing water, \': and the
flint-stone into a springing well.\

**Psalm 115. Non nobis, Domine.**\
NOT unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy Name give the praise; \*
for thy loving mercy, and for thy truth\'s sake.\
2 Wherefore shall the heathen say, \* Where is now their God?\
3 As for our God, he is in heaven: \* he hath done whatsoever pleased
him.\
4 Their idols are silver and gold, \* even the work of men\'s hands.\
5 They have mouths, and speak not; \* eyes have they, and see not.\
6 They have ears, and hear not; \* noses have they, and smell not.\
7 They have hands, and handle not; feet have they, and walk not; \*
neither speak they through their throat.\
8 They that make them are like unto them; \* and so are all such as put
their trust in them.\
9 But thou, house of Israel, trust thou in the LORD; \* he is their
helper and defender.\
10 Ye house of Aaron, put your trust in the LORD; \* he is their helper
and defender.\
11 Ye that fear the LORD, put your trust in the LORD; \* he is their
helper and defender.\
12 The LORD hath been mindful of us, and he shall bless us; \* even he
shall bless the house of Israel, he shall bless the house of Aaron.\
13 He shall bless them that fear the LORD, \* both small and great.\
14 The LORD shall increase you more and more, \* you and your children.\
15 Ye are the blessed of the LORD, \* who made heaven and earth.\
16 All the whole heavens are the LORD\'S; \* the earth hath he given to
the children of men.\
17 The dead praise not thee, O LORD, \* neither all they that go down
into silence.\
18 But we will praise the LORD, \* from this time forth for evermore.
Praise the LORD.
