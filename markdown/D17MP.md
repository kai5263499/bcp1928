**Psalm 86. Inclina, Domine.**\
BOW down thine ear, O LORD, and hear me; \* for I am poor, and in
misery.\
2 Preserve thou my soul, for I am holy: \* my God, save thy servant that
putteth his trust in thee.\
3 Be merciful unto me, O Lord; \* for I will call daily upon thee.\
4 Comfort the soul of thy servant; \* for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift
up my soul.\
5 For thou, Lord, art good and gracious, \* and of great mercy unto all
them that call upon thee.\
6 Give ear, LORD, unto my prayer, \* and ponder the voice of my humble
desires.\
7 In the time of my trouble I will call upon thee; \* for thou hearest
me.\
8 Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; \* there is not
one that can do as thou doest.\
9 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship thee, O Lord;
\* and shall glorify thy Name.\
10 For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: \* thou art God
alone.\
11 Teach me thy way, O LORD, and I will walk in thy truth: \* O knit my
heart unto thee, that I may fear thy Name.\
12 I will thank thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart; \* and will
praise thy Name for evermore.\
13 For great is thy mercy toward me; \* and thou hast delivered my soul
from the nethermost hell.\
14 O God, the proud are risen against me; \* and the congregations of
violent men have sought after my soul, and have not set thee before
their eyes.\
15 But thou, O Lord God, art full of compassion and mercy, \*
long-suffering, plenteous in goodness and truth.\
16 O turn thee then unto me, and have mercy upon me; \* give thy
strength unto thy servant, and help the son of thine handmaid.\
17 Show some token upon me for good; that they who hate me may see it,
and be ashamed, \* because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted
me.\

**Psalm 87. Fundamenta ejus.**\
HER foundations are upon the holy hills: \* the LORD loveth the gates of
Sion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.\
2 Very excellent things are spoken of thee, \* thou city of God.\
3 I will make mention of Egypt and Babylon, \* among them that know me.\
4 Behold, Philistia also; and Tyre, with Ethiopia; \* lo, in Sion were
they born.\
5 Yea, of Sion it shall be reported, this one and that one were born in
her; \* and the Most High shall stablish her.\
6 The LORD shall record it, when he writeth up the peoples; \* lo, in
Sion were they born.\
7 The singers also and trumpeters shall make answer: \* All my fresh
springs are in thee.\

**Psalm 88. Domine, Deus.**\
O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee: \* O
let my prayer enter into thy presence, incline thine ear unto my
calling;\
2 For my soul is full of trouble, \* and my life draweth nigh unto the
grave.\
3 I am counted as one of them that go down into the pit, \* and I am
even as a man that hath no strength;\
4 Cast off among the dead, like unto them that are slain, and lie in the
grave, \* who are out of remembrance, and are cut away from thy hand.\
5 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, \* in a place of darkness, and in
the deep.\
6 Thine indignation lieth hard upon me, \* and thou hast vexed me with
all thy storms.\
7 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me, \* and made me to be
abhorred of them.\
8 I am so fast in prison \* that I cannot get forth.\
9 My sight faileth for very trouble; \* LORD, I have called daily upon
thee, I have stretched forth my hands unto thee.\
10 Dost thou show wonders among the dead? \* or shall the dead rise up
again, and praise thee?\
11 Shall thy loving-kindness be showed in the grave? \* or thy
faithfulness in destruction?\
12 Shall thy wondrous works be known in the dark? \* and thy
righteousness in the land where all things are forgotten?\
13 Unto thee have I cried, O LORD; \* and early shall my prayer come
before thee.\
14 LORD, why abhorrest thou my soul, \* and hidest thou thy face from
me?\
15 I am in misery, and like unto him that is at the point to die; \*
even from my youth up, thy terrors have I suffered with a troubled
mind.\
16 Thy wrathful displeasure goeth over me, \* and the fear of thee hath
undone me.\
17 They came round about me daily like water, \* and compassed me
together on every side.\
18 My lovers and friends hast thou put away from me, \* and hid mine
acquaintance out of my sight.
