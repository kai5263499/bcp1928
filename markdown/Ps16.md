| **Psalms 16. Conserva me, Domine.**\                                  |
| PRESERVE me, O God; \* for in thee have I put my trust.\              |
| 2 O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, \* Thou art my God; I have |
| no good like unto thee.\                                              |
| 3 All my delight is upon the saints that are in the earth, \* and     |
| upon such as excel in virtue.\                                        |
| 4 But they that run after another god \* shall have great trouble.\   |
| 5 Their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, \* neither make    |
| mention of their names within my lips.\                               |
| 6 The LORD himself is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup; |
| \* thou shalt maintain my lot.\                                       |
| 7 The lot is fallen unto me in a fair ground; \* yea, I have a goodly |
| heritage.\                                                            |
| 8 I will thank the LORD for giving me warning; \* my reins also       |
| chasten me in the night season.\                                      |
| 9 I have set the LORD alway before me; \* for he is on my right hand, |
| therefore I shall not fall.\                                          |
| 10 Wherefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: \* my flesh    |
| also shall rest in hope.\                                             |
| 11 For why? thou shalt not leave my soul in hell; \* neither shalt    |
| thou suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.\                          |
| 12 Thou shalt show me the path of life: in thy presence is the        |
| fulness of joy, \* and at thy right hand there is pleasure for        |
| evermore.                                                             |
