| **Psalm 62. Nonne Deo?**\                                             |
| MY soul truly waiteth still upon God; \* for of him cometh my         |
| salvation.\                                                           |
| 2 He verily is my strength and my salvation; \* he is my defence, so  |
| that I shall not greatly fall.\                                       |
| 3 How long will ye imagine mischief against every man? \* Ye shall be |
| slain all the sort of you; yea, as a tottering wall shall ye be, and  |
| like a broken hedge.\                                                 |
| 4 Their device is only how to put him out whom God will exalt; \*     |
| their delight is in lies; they give good words with their mouth, but  |
| curse with their heart.\                                              |
| 5 Nevertheless, my soul, wait thou still upon God; \* for my hope is  |
| in him.\                                                              |
| 6 He truly is my strength and my salvation; \* he is my defence, so   |
| that I shall not fall.\                                               |
| 7 In God is my health and my glory; \* the rock of my might; and in   |
| God is my trust.\                                                     |
| 8 O put your trust in him alway, ye people; \* pour out your hearts   |
| before him, for God is our hope.\                                     |
| 9 As for the children of men, they are but vanity; the children of    |
| men are deceitful; \* upon the weights they are altogether lighter    |
| than vanity itself.\                                                  |
| 10 O trust not in wrong and robbery; give not yourselves unto vanity: |
| \* if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.\                 |
| 11 God spake once, and twice I have also heard the same, \* that      |
| power belongeth unto God;\                                            |
| 12 And that thou, Lord, art merciful; \* for thou rewardest every man |

| Psalm 63. Deus, Deus meus.**\                                         |
| O GOD, thou art my God; \* early will I seek thee.\                   |
| 2 My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh also longeth after thee, \* in |
| a barren and dry land where no water is.\                             |
| 3 Thus have I looked for thee in the sanctuary, \* that I might       |
| behold thy power and glory.\                                          |
| 4 For thy loving-kindness is better than the life itself: \* my lips  |
| shall praise thee.\                                                   |
| 5 As long as I live will I magnify thee in this manner, \* and lift   |
| up my hands in thy Name.\                                             |
| 6 My soul shall be satisfied, even as it were with marrow and         |
| fatness, \* when my mouth praiseth thee with joyful lips.\            |
| 7 Have I not remembered thee in my bed, \* and thought upon thee when |
| I was waking?\                                                        |
| 8 Because thou hast been my helper; \* therefore under the shadow of  |
| thy wings will I rejoice.\                                            |
| 9 My soul hangeth upon thee; \* thy right hand hath upholden me.\     |
| 10 These also that seek the hurt of my soul, \* they shall go under   |
| the earth.\                                                           |
| 11 Let them fall upon the edge of the sword, \* that they may be a    |
| portion for foxes.\                                                   |
| 12 But the King shall rejoice in God; all they also that swear by him |
| shall be commended; \* for the mouth of them that speak lies shall be |
| stopped.\                                                             |

| Psalm 64. Exaudi, Deus.**\                                            |
| HEAR my voice, O God, in my prayer; \* preserve my life from fear of  |
| the enemy.\                                                           |

| insurrection of wicked doers;\                                        |
| 3 Who have whet their tongue like a sword, \* and shoot out their     |
| arrows, even bitter words;\                                           |
| 4 That they may privily shoot at him that is perfect: \* suddenly do  |
| they hit him, and fear not.\                                          |
| 5 They encourage themselves in mischief, \* and commune among         |
| themselves, how they may lay snares; and say, that no man shall see   |
| them.\                                                                |
| 6 They imagine wickedness, and practise it; \* that they keep secret  |
| among themselves, every man in the deep of his heart.\                |
| 7 But God shall suddenly shoot at them with a swift arrow, \* that    |
| they shall be wounded.\                                               |
| 8 Yea, their own tongues shall make them fall; \* insomuch that whoso |
| seeth them shall laugh them to scorn.\                                |
| 9 And all men that see it shall say, This hath God done; \* for they  |
| shall perceive that it is his work.\                                  |
| 10 The righteous shall rejoice in the LORD, and put his trust in him; |
| \* and all they that are true of heart shall be glad.\                |

| morning and evening to praise thee.\                                  |

| for so thou providest for the earth.\                                 |
| 11 Thou waterest her furrows; thou sendest rain into the little       |
| valleys thereof; \* thou makest it soft with the drops of rain, and   |
| blessest the increase of it.\                                         |

| 2 Say unto God, O how wonderful art thou in thy works! \* through the |
| greatness of thy power shall thine enemies bow down unto thee.\       |

| water on foot; there did we rejoice thereof.\                         |
| 6 He ruleth with his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: \*  |
| and such as will not believe shall not be able to exalt themselves.\  |
| 7 O praise our God, ye peoples, \* and make the voice of his praise   |
| to be heard;\                                                         |

| 9 For thou, O God, hast proved us; \* thou also hast tried us, like   |
| as silver is tried.\                                                  |
| 10 Thou broughtest us into the snare; \* and laidest trouble upon our |
| loins.\                                                               |
| 11 Thou sufferedst men to ride over our heads; \* we went through     |
| fire and water, and thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.\     |
| 12 I will go into thine house with burnt-offerings, and will pay thee |
| my vows, \* which I promised with my lips, and spake with my mouth,   |
| when I was in trouble.\                                               |
| 13 I will offer unto thee fat burnt-sacrifices, with the incense of   |
| rams; \* I will offer bullocks and goats.\                            |
| 14 O come hither, and hearken, all ye that fear God; \* and I will    |
| tell you what he hath done for my soul.\                              |
| 15 I called unto him with my mouth, \* and gave him praises with my   |
| tongue.\                                                              |

| hear me.\                                                             |
| 17 But God hath heard me; \* and considered the voice of my prayer.\  |
| 18 Praised be God, who hath not cast out my prayer, \* nor turned his |
| mercy from me.\                                                       |
