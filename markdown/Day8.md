| Morning Prayer.                                                       |

| **Psalm 38. Domine, ne in furore.**\                                  |
| PUT me not to rebuke, O LORD, in thine anger; \* neither chasten me   |
| in thy heavy displeasure:\                                            |
| 2 For thine arrows stick fast in me, \* and thy hand presseth me      |
| sore.\                                                                |
| 3 There is no health in my flesh, because of thy displeasure; \*      |
| neither is there any rest in my bones, by reason of my sin.\          |
| 4 For my wickednesses are gone over my head, \* and are like a sore   |
| burden, too heavy for me to bear.\                                    |
| 5 My wounds stink, and are corrupt, \* through my foolishness.\       |
| 6 I am brought into so great trouble and misery, \* that I go         |
| mourning all the day long.\                                           |
| 7 For my loins are filled with a sore disease, \* and there is no     |
| whole part in my body.\                                               |
| 8 I am feeble and sore smitten; \* I have roared for the very         |
| disquietness of my heart.\                                            |
| 9 Lord, thou knowest all my desire; \* and my groaning is not hid     |
| from thee.\                                                           |
| 10 My heart panteth, my strength hath failed me, \* and the light of  |
| mine eyes is gone from me.\                                           |
| 11 My lovers and my neighbours did stand looking upon my trouble, \*  |
| and my kinsmen stood afar off.\                                       |
| 12 They also that sought after my life laid snares for me; \* and     |
| they that went about to do me evil talked of wickedness, and imagined |
| deceit all the day long.\                                             |
| 13 As for me, I was like a deaf man, and heard not; \* and as one     |
| that is dumb, who doth not open his mouth.\                           |
| 14 I became even as a man that heareth not, \* and in whose mouth are |
| no reproofs.\                                                         |
| 15 For in thee, O LORD, have I put my trust; \* thou shalt answer for |
| me, O Lord my God.\                                                   |
| 16 I have required that they, even mine enemies, should not triumph   |
| over me; \* for when my foot slipt, they rejoiced greatly against     |
| me.\                                                                  |
| 17 And I truly am set in the plague, \* and my heaviness is ever in   |
| my sight.\                                                            |
| 18 For I will confess my wickedness, \* and be sorry for my sin.\     |
| 19 But mine enemies live, and are mighty; \* and they that hate me    |
| wrongfully are many in number.\                                       |
| 20 They also that reward evil for good are against me; \* because I   |
| follow the thing that good is.\                                       |
| 21 Forsake me not, O LORD my God; \* be not thou far from me.\        |
| \                                                                     |
| **\                                                                   |
| Psalm 39. Dixi, Custodiam.**\                                         |
| I SAID, I will take heed to my ways, \* that I offend not in my       |
| tongue\                                                               |
| 2 I will keep my mouth as it were with a bridle, \* while the ungodly |
| is in my sight.\                                                      |
| 3 I held my tongue, and spake nothing: \* I kept silence, yea, even   |
| from good words; but it was pain and grief to me.\                    |
| 4 My heart was hot within me: and while I was thus musing the fire    |
| kindled, \* and at the last I spake with my tongue:\                  |
| 5 LORD, let me know mine end, and the number of my days; \* that I    |
| may be certified how long I have to live.\                            |
| 6 Behold, thou hast made my days as it were a span long, and mine age |
| is even as nothing in respect of thee; \* and verily every man living |
| is altogether vanity.\                                                |
| 7 For man walketh in a vain shadow, and disquieteth himself in vain;  |
| \* he heapeth up riches, and cannot tell who shall gather them.\      |
| 8 And now, Lord, what is my hope? \* truly my hope is even in thee.\  |
| 9 Deliver me from all mine offences; \* and make me not a rebuke unto |
| the foolish.\                                                         |
| 10 I became dumb, and opened not my mouth; \* for it was thy doing.\  |
| 11 Take thy plague away from me: \* I am even consumed by the means   |
| of thy heavy hand.\                                                   |
| 12 When thou with rebukes dost chasten man for sin, thou makest his   |
| beauty to consume away, like as it were a moth fretting a garment: \* |
| every man therefore is but vanity.\                                   |
| 13 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and with thine ears consider my calling;   |
| \* hold not thy peace at my tears;\                                   |
| 14 For I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, \* as all my       |
| fathers were.\                                                        |
| 15 O spare me a little, that I may recover my strength, \* before I   |
| go hence, and be no more seen.\                                       |
| \                                                                     |
| **\                                                                   |
| Psalm 40. Expectans expectavi.**\                                     |
| I WAITED patiently for the LORD, \* and he inclined unto me, and      |
| heard my calling.\                                                    |
| 2 He brought me also out of the horrible pit, out of the mire and     |
| clay, \* and set my feet upon the rock, and ordered my goings.\       |
| 3 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, \* even a thanksgiving unto |
| our God.\                                                             |
| 4 Many shall see it, and fear, \* and shall put their trust in the    |
| LORD.\                                                                |
| 5 Blessed is the man that hath set his hope in the LORD, \* and       |
| turned not unto the proud, and to such as go about with lies.\        |
| 6 O LORD my God, great are the wondrous works which thou hast done,   |
| like as be also thy thoughts, which are to us-ward; \* and yet there  |
| is no man that ordereth them unto thee.\                              |
| 7 If I should declare them, and speak of them, \* they should be more |
| than I am able to express.\                                           |
| 8 Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, \* but mine ears hast     |
| thou opened.\                                                         |
| 9 Burnt-offering and sacrifice for sin hast thou not required: \*     |
| then said I, LO, I come;\                                             |
| 10 In the volume of the book it is written of me, that I should       |
| fulfil thy will, O my God: \* I am content to do it; yea, thy law is  |
| within my heart.\                                                     |
| 11 I have declared thy righteousness in the great congregation: \*    |
| lo, I will not refrain my lips, O LORD, and that thou knowest.\       |
| 12 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; \* my talk hath  |
| been of thy truth, and of thy salvation.\                             |
| 13 I have not kept back thy loving mercy and truth \* from the great  |
| congregation.\                                                        |
| 14 Withdraw not thou thy mercy from me, O LORD; \* let thy            |
| loving-kindness and thy truth alway preserve me.\                     |
| 15 For innumerable troubles are come about me; my sins have taken     |
| such hold upon me, that I am not able to look up; \* yea, they are    |
| more in number than the hairs of my head, and my heart hath failed    |
| me.\                                                                  |
| 16 O LORD, let it be thy pleasure to deliver me; \* make haste, O     |
| LORD, to help me.\                                                    |
| 17 Let them be ashamed, and confounded together, that seek after my   |
| soul to destroy it; \* let them be driven backward, and put to        |
| rebuke, that wish me evil.\                                           |
| 18 Let them be desolate, and rewarded with shame, \* that say unto    |
| me, Fie upon thee! fie upon thee!\                                    |
| 19 Let all those that seek thee, be joyful and glad in thee; \* and   |
| let such as love thy salvation, say alway, The LORD be praised.\      |
| 20 As for me, I am poor and needy; \* but the Lord careth for me.\    |
| 21 Thou art my helper and redeemer; \* make no long tarrying, O my    |
| God.\                                                                 |

| **Psalm 41. Beatus qui intelligit.**\                                 |
| BLESSED is he that considereth the poor and needy; \* the LORD shall  |
| deliver him in the time of trouble.\                                  |
| 2 The LORD preserve him, and keep him alive, that he may be blessed   |
| upon earth; \* and deliver not thou him into the will of his          |
| enemies.\                                                             |
| 3 The LORD comfort him when he lieth sick upon his bed; \* make thou  |
| all his bed in his sickness.\                                         |
| 4 I said, LORD, be merciful unto me; \* heal my soul, for I have      |
| sinned against thee.\                                                 |
| 5 Mine enemies speak evil of me, \* When shall he die, and his name   |
| perish?\                                                              |
| 6 And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity, \* and his heart      |
| conceiveth falsehood within himself; and when he cometh forth, he     |
| telleth it.\                                                          |
| 7 All mine enemies whisper together against me; \* even against me do |
| they imagine this evil.\                                              |
| 8 An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him; \* and now that  |
| he lieth, he shall rise up no more.\                                  |
| 9 Yea, even mine own familiar friend whom I trusted, \* who did also  |
| eat of my bread, hath laid great wait for me.\                        |
| 10 But be thou merciful unto me, O LORD; \* raise thou me up again,   |
| and I shall reward them.\                                             |
| 11 By this I know thou favourest me, \* that mine enemy doth not      |
| triumph against me.\                                                  |
| 12 And in my innocency thou upholdest me, \* and shalt set me before  |
| thy face for ever.\                                                   |
| 13 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, \* world without end. Amen.\    |
| \                                                                     |
| **Psalm 42. Quemadmodum.**\                                           |
| LIKE as the hart desireth the water-brooks, \* so longeth my soul     |
| after thee, O God.\                                                   |
| 2 My soul is athirst for God, yea, even for the living God: \* when   |
| shall I come to appear before the presence of God?\                   |
| 3 My tears have been my meat day and night, \* while they daily say   |
| unto me, Where is now thy God?\                                       |
| 4 Now when I think thereupon, I pour out my heart by myself; \* for I |
| went with the multitude, and brought them forth into the house of     |
| God;\                                                                 |
| 5 In the voice of praise and thanksgiving, \* among such as keep      |
| holy-day.\                                                            |
| 6 Why art thou so full of heaviness, O my soul? \* and why art thou   |
| so disquieted within me?\                                             |
| 7 O put thy trust in God; \* for I will yet thank him, which is the   |
| help of my countenance, and my God.\                                  |
| 8 My soul is vexed within me; \* therefore will I remember thee from  |
| the land of Jordan, from Hermon and the little hill.\                 |
| 9 One deep calleth another, because of the noise of thy water-floods; |
| \* all thy waves and storms are gone over me.\                        |
| 10 The LORD will grant his loving-kindness in the daytime; \* and in  |
| the night season will I sing of him, and make my prayer unto the God  |
| of my life.\                                                          |
| 11 I will say unto the God of my strength, Why hast thou forgotten    |
| me? \* why go I thus heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?\         |
| 12 My bones are smitten asunder as with a sword, \* while mine        |
| enemies that trouble me cast me in the teeth;\                        |
| 13 Namely, while they say daily unto me, \* Where is now thy God?\    |
| 14 Why art thou so vexed, O my soul? \* and why art thou so           |
| disquieted within me?\                                                |
| 15 O put thy trust in God; \* for I will yet thank him, which is the  |
| help of my countenance, and my God.\                                  |
| \                                                                     |

| Psalm 43. Judica me, Deus.**\                                         |
| GIVE sentence with me, O God, and defend my cause against the ungodly |
| people; \* O deliver me from the deceitful and wicked man.\           |
| 2 For thou art the God of my strength; why hast thou put me from      |
| thee? \* and why go I so heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?\     |
| 3 O send out thy light and thy truth, that they may lead me, \* and   |
| bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy dwelling;\                    |
| 4 And that I may go unto the altar of God, even unto the God of my    |
| joy and gladness; \* and upon the harp will I give thanks unto thee,  |
| O God, my God.\                                                       |
| 5 Why art thou so heavy, O my soul? \* and why art thou so disquieted |
| within me?\                                                           |
| 6 O put thy trust in God; \* for I will yet give him thanks, which is |
| the help of my countenance, and my God.                               |
|                                                                       |
