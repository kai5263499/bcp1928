| **Psalms 3. Domine, quid multiplicati?**\                             |
| LORD, how are they increased that trouble me! \* many are they that   |
| rise against me.\                                                     |
| 2 Many one there be that say of my soul, \* There is no help for him  |
| in his God.\                                                          |
| 3 But thou, O LORD, art my defender; \* thou art my worship, and the  |
| lifter up of my head.\                                                |
| 4 I did call upon the LORD with my voice, \* and he heard me out of   |
| his holy hill.\                                                       |
| 5 I laid me down and slept, and rose up again; \* for the LORD        |
| sustained me.\                                                        |
| 6 I will not be afraid for ten thousands of the people, \* that have  |
| set themselves against me round about.\                               |
| 7 UP, LORD, and help me, O my God, \* for thou smitest all mine       |
| enemies upon the cheek-bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the        |
| ungodly.\                                                             |
| 8 Salvation belongeth unto the LORD; \* and thy blessing is upon thy  |
| people.                                                               |
