| **Psalm 98. Cantate Domino**.\                                        |
| O SING unto the LORD a new song; \* for he hath done marvellous       |
| things.\                                                              |
| 2 With his own right hand, and with his holy arm, \* hath he gotten   |
| himself the victory.\                                                 |
| 3 The LORD declared his salvation; \* his righteousness hath he       |
| openly showed in the sight of the heathen.\                           |
| 4 He hath remembered his mercy and truth toward the house of Israel;  |
| \* and all the ends of the world have seen the salvation of our God.\ |
| 5 Show yourselves joyful unto the LORD, all ye lands; \* sing,        |
| rejoice, and give thanks.\                                            |
| 6 Praise the LORD upon the harp; \* sing to the harp with a psalm of  |
| thanksgiving.\                                                        |
| 7 With trumpets also and shawms, \* O show yourselves joyful before   |
| the LORD, the King.\                                                  |
| 8 Let the sea make a noise, and all that therein is; \* the round     |
| world, and they that dwell therein.\                                  |
| 9 Let the floods clap their hands, and let the hills be joyful        |
| together before the LORD; \* for he is come to judge the earth.\      |
| 10 With righteousness shall he judge the world, \* and the peoples    |
| with equity.                                                          |
