| every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law,   |
| or no.\                                                               |

| that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what are we,    |
| that ye murmur against us?\                                           |
| 8 And Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the  |

| the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and     |
| what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the      |

| servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord\'s ears, and let not    |
| thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.\  |
| 19 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a         |
| brother?\                                                             |

| child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he   |
| alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.\              |
| 21 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I  |
| may set mine eyes upon him.\                                          |
| 22 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if  |
| he should leave his father, his father would die.\                    |
| 23 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother    |
| come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.\                    |
| 24 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we |
| told him the words of my lord.\                                       |
| 25 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.\          |
| 26 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with    |
| us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man\'s face, except  |
| our youngest brother be with us.\                                     |
| 27 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare  |
| me two sons:\                                                         |
| 28 And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in     |
| pieces; and I saw him not since:\                                     |
| 29 And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye      |
| shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.\             |
| 30 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be |
| not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad\'s life;\    |
| 31 It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us,  |
| that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of |
| thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.\                     |
| 32 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying,  |
| If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my       |
| father for ever.\                                                     |
| []{#anchor1008601}33 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant      |

| 12 For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members |
| of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.\       |
| 13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be |
| Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made  |
| to drink into one Spirit.\                                            |
| 14 For the body is not one member, but many.\                         |
| 15 If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the  |
| body; is it therefore not of the body?\                               |
| 16 And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of    |
| the body; is it therefore not of the body?\                           |
| 17 If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the      |
| whole were hearing, where were the smelling?\                         |
| 18 But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as |
| it hath pleased him.\                                                 |

| 21 And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor  |
| again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.\                   |
| 22 Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more    |
| feeble, are necessary:\                                               |
| 23 And those members of the body, which we think to be less           |
| honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our        |
| uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.\                        |
| 24 For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body  |
| together, having given more abundant honour to that part which        |
| lacked:\                                                              |
| 25 That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members   |
| should have the same care one for another.\                           |
| 26 And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or  |
| one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.\             |
| 27 Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.\         |
| 28 And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily   |

| 31 And yet show I unto you a more excellent way.\                     |
| 1 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not  |
| charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.\        |
| 2 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all          |
| mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I  |
| could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.\          |
| 3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I     |
| give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me      |

| endureth all things.\                                                 |

| knowledge, it shall vanish away.\                                     |

| 10 But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part |
| shall be done away.\                                                  |

| 28 And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning       |

| Which is the first commandment of all?\                               |

| Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:\                        |
| 30 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with  |

| as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.\      |
| 32 And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the     |
| truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:\         |
| 33 And to love him with all the heart, and with all the               |

| with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:\                         |

| himself with his face to the earth.\                                  |
| 13 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward        |
| Israel\'s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel\'s   |
| right hand, and brought them near unto him.\                          |

| my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and      |
| Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.\ |
| 17 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the   |
| head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father\'s      |
| hand, to remove it from Ephraim\'s head unto Manasseh\'s head.\       |
| 18 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is    |
| the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.\                     |
| 19 And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he |

| me, yet my mind could not be toward this people: cast them out of my  |
| sight, and let them go forth.\                                        |

| for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and |

| 4 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the  |
| house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes,     |
| speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,\                   |
| 5 My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I     |

| Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I    |

| the land of Egypt,\                                                   |

| Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore             |
| lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.\       |
| 11 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the      |
| mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning |
| to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim,   |
| which is beyond Jordan.\                                              |

| went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.\ |

| said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us |
| all the evil which we did unto him.\                                  |
| 16 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did      |
| command before he died, saying,\                                      |
| 17 So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the         |
| trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: |
| and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the    |
| God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.\         |
| 18 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they |
| said, Behold, we be thy servants.\                                    |

| lived an hundred and ten years.\                                      |

| visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he      |
| sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.\                            |

| not be thrown down.\                                                  |

| when all these things shall be fulfilled?\                            |

| and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be   |
| famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.\           |
| 9 But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to       |
| councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be   |
| brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against  |
| them.\                                                                |
| 10 And the gospel must first be published among all nations.\         |
| 11 But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought  |
| beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but        |
| whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is  |
| not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.\                               |
| 12 Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father  |
| the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall  |
| cause them to be put to death.\                                       |

| said, Surely this thing is known.\                                    |
| 15 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But    |
| Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: |
| and he sat down by a well.\                                           |
| 16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and    |
| drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father\'s flock.\   |
| 17 And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and |
| helped them, and watered their flock.\                                |
| 18 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that  |
| ye are come so soon today?\                                           |
| 19 And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the     |
| shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.\ |
| 20 And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye |
| have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.\                  |
| 21 And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses     |
| Zipporah his daughter.\                                               |
| 22 And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he     |

| 1 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached  |
| unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;\         |
| 2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached    |
| unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.\                           |

| how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;\       |
| 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day        |
| according to the scriptures:\                                         |

| 8 And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due   |
| time.\                                                                |

| an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.\                  |
| 10 But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was    |
| bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than |
| they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.\         |
