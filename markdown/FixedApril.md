| in my prayer.\                                                        |

| the end.\                                                             |

| delighted in her: my foot went the right way, from my youth up sought |
| I after her.\                                                         |

| that giveth me wisdom.\                                               |
| 18 For I purposed to do after her, and earnestly I followed that      |
| which is good; so shall I not be confounded.\                         |
| 19 My soul hath wrestled with her, and in my doings I was exact: I    |
| stretched forth my hands to the heaven above, and bewailed my         |

| by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles   |
