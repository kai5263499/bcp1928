| **Psalm 129. Saepe expugnaverunt.**\                                  |
| MANY a time have they fought against me from my youth up, \* may      |
| Israel now say;\                                                      |
| 2 Yea, many a time have they vexed me from my youth up; \* but they   |
| have not prevailed against me.\                                       |
| 3 The plowers plowed upon my back, \* and made long furrows.\         |
| 4 But the righteous LORD \* hath hewn the snares of the ungodly in    |
| pieces.\                                                              |
| 5 Let them be confounded and turned backward, \* as many as have evil |
| will at Sion.\                                                        |
| 6 Let them be even as the grass upon the housetops, \* which          |
| withereth afore it be grown up;\                                      |
| 7 Whereof the mower filleth not his hand, \* neither he that bindeth  |
| up the sheaves his bosom.\                                            |
| 8 So that they who go by say not so much as, The LORD prosper you; \* |
| we wish you good luck in the Name of the LORD.                        |
