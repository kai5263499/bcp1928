| O ALMIGHTY God, who by thy Son Jesus Christ didst give to thy Apostle |
| Saint Peter many excellent gifts, and commandedst him earnestly to    |
| feed thy flock; Make, we beseech thee, all Bishops and Pastors        |
| diligently to preach thy holy Word, and the people obediently to      |
| follow the same, that they may receive the crown of everlasting       |
| glory; through the same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\         |
|                                                                       |
| For the Epistle. Acts xii. 1.                                         |
|                                                                       |
| ABOUT that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex       |
| certain of the church. And he killed James the brother of John with   |
| the sword. And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded       |
| further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.) |
| And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered  |
| him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after      |
| Easter to bring him forth to the people. Peter therefore was kept in  |
| prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God    |
| for him. And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night  |
| Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and   |
| the keepers before the door kept the prison. And, behold, the angel   |
| of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he   |
| smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. |
| And his chains fell off from his hands. And the angel said unto him,  |
| Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith    |
| unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me. And he went     |
| out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done   |
| by the angel; but thought he saw a vision. When they were past the    |
| first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth  |
| unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went  |
| out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel        |
| departed from him. And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I |
| know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath         |
| delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation   |
| of the people of the Jews.\                                           |
|                                                                       |
| The Gospel. St. Matthew xvi. 13.                                      |
|                                                                       |
| WHEN Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his    |
| disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am? And they |
| said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and       |
| others, Jeremias or one of the prophets. He saith unto them, But whom |
| say ye that I am? And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the     |
| Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered and said unto   |
| him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not   |
| revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. And I say    |
| also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build  |
| my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I  |
| will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever |
| thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever     |
| thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.                  |
|                                                                       |
