| acceptable, and perfect, will of God.\                                |

| sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:\                      |
| 9 And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off    |
| all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name,  |
| like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth.\           |

| LORD, and he said, Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that   |
| thou hast brought me hitherto?\                                       |
| 19 And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou  |
| hast spoken also of thy servant\'s house for a great while to come.   |
| And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?\                           |
| 20 And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest |
| thy servant.\                                                         |
| 21 For thy word\'s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou  |
| done all these great things, to make thy servant know them.\          |
| 22 Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like thee, |
| neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have   |
| heard with our ears.\                                                 |
| 23 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like     |
| Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make  |
| him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy      |
| land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt,    |
| from the nations and their gods?\                                     |
| 24 For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a       |
| people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God.\     |
| 25 And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy |
| servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as   |
| thou hast said.\                                                      |
| 26 And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts  |
| is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be     |
| established before thee.\                                             |
| 27 For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy     |
| servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy       |
| servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.\            |
| 28 And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true, and |
| thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:\                   |
| 29 Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy         |
| servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord  |
| GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy       |

| charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.\     |
| 16 Let not then your good be evil spoken of:\                         |
| 17 For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness,   |
| and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.\                                |
| 18 For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God,   |

| 20 For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure;  |
| but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.\                 |
| 21 It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing  |
| whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.\      |
| 22 Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that   |
| condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.\              |
| 23 And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of |

| 1 And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when   |
| kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with |
| him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and    |
| besieged Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem.\               |
| 2 And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off    |
| his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king\'s house: and from the  |
| roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful |
| to look upon.\                                                        |
| 3 And David sent and inquired after the woman. And one said, Is not   |
| this Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the         |
| Hittite?\                                                             |
| 4 And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him,  |
| and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and   |
| she returned unto her house.\                                         |
| 5 And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am    |
| with child.\                                                          |
| 6 And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab |
| sent Uriah to David.\                                                 |
| 7 And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how Joab    |
| did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.\              |
| 8 And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet.   |
| And Uriah departed out of the king\'s house, and there followed him a |
| mess of meat from the king.\                                          |
| 9 But Uriah slept at the door of the king\'s house with all the       |
| servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.\                |
| 10 And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his |
| house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy journey? why   |
| then didst thou not go down unto thine house?\                        |
| 11 And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide   |
| in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped |
| in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to    |
| drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul       |
| liveth, I will not do this thing.\                                    |
| 12 And David said to Uriah, Tarry here today also, and tomorrow I     |
| will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the   |
| morrow.\                                                              |
| 13 And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him;    |
| and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with |
| the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.\            |

| 13 And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called    |
| Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.\          |
| 14 And they talked together of all these things which had happened.\  |
| 15 And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and        |

| 16 But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.\         |
| 17 And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these     |
| that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?\                |
| 18 And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto   |
| him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the    |
| things which are come to pass there in these days?\                   |
| 19 And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him,        |
| Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and  |
| word before God and all the people:\                                  |
| 20 And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be       |
| condemned to death, and have crucified him.\                          |
| 21 But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed      |
| Israel: and beside all this, today is the third day since these       |
| things were done.\                                                    |

| which were early at the sepulchre;\                                   |
| 23 And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had |
| also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.\          |
| 24 And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and  |
| found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.\        |
| 25 Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all  |
| that the prophets have spoken:\                                       |

| his glory?\                                                           |

| them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.\            |
| 28 And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he     |
| made as though he would have gone further.\                           |
| 29 But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward  |
| evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with       |
| them.\                                                                |

| and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.\                         |
| 31 And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out |

| 32 And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us,    |

| 14 And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to   |
| Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.\                              |
| 15 And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront  |
| of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be         |
| smitten, and die.\                                                    |
| 16 And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned |
| Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were.\              |
| 17 And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there  |
| fell some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the       |
| Hittite died also.\                                                   |
| 18 Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;\  |
| 19 And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of   |
| telling the matters of the war unto the king,\                        |
| 20 And if so be that the king\'s wrath arise, and he say unto thee,   |
| Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew |
| ye not that they would shoot from the wall?\                          |
| 21 Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast  |
| a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in        |
| Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah   |
| the Hittite is dead also.\                                            |
| 22 So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had |
| sent him for.\                                                        |
| 23 And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed        |
| against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon     |
| them even unto the entering of the gate.\                             |
| 24 And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and     |
| some of the king\'s servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the       |
| Hittite is dead also.\                                                |
| 25 Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, |
| Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as     |
| well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and    |
| overthrow it: and encourage thou him.\                                |
| 26 And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead,  |
| she mourned for her husband.\                                         |
| 27 And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his  |
| house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing     |
