**Psalm 44. Deus, auribus.**\
WE have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us \* what
thou hast done in their time of old:\
2 How thou hast driven out the heathen with thy hand, and planted our
fathers in; \* how thou hast destroyed the nations, and made thy people
to flourish.\
3 For they gat not the land in possession through their own sword, \*
neither was it their own arm that helped them;\
4 But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance;
\* because thou hadst a favour unto them.\
5 Thou art my King, O God; \* send help unto Jacob.\
6 Through thee will we overthrow our enemies, \* and in thy Name will we
tread them under that rise up against us.\
7 For I will not trust in my bow, \* it is not my sword that shall help
me;\
8 But it is thou that savest us from our enemies, \* and puttest them to
confusion that hate us.\
9 We make our boast of God all day long, \* and will praise thy Name for
ever.\
10 But now thou art far off, and puttest us to confusion, \* and goest
not forth with our armies.\
11 Thou makest us to turn our backs upon our enemies, \* so that they
which hate us spoil our goods.\
12 Thou lettest us be eaten up like sheep, \* and hast scattered us
among the heathen.\
13 Thou sellest thy people for nought, \* and takest no money for them.\
14 Thou makest us to be rebuked of our neighbours, \* to be laughed to
scorn, and had in derision of them that are round about us.\
15 Thou makest us to be a by-word among the nations, \* and that the
peoples shake their heads at us.\
16 My confusion is daily before me, \* and the shame of my face hath
covered me;\
17 For the voice of the slanderer and blasphemer, \* for the enemy and
avenger.\
18 And though all this be come upon us, yet do we not forget thee, \*
nor behave ourselves frowardly in thy covenant.\
19 Our heart is not turned back, \* neither our steps gone out of thy
way;\
20 No, not when thou hast smitten us into the place of dragons, \* and
covered us with the shadow of death.\
21 If we have forgotten the Name of our God, and holden up our hands to
any strange god, \* shall not God search it out? for he knoweth the very
secrets of the heart.\
22 For thy sake also are we killed all the day long, \* and are counted
as sheep appointed to be slain.\
23 Up, Lord, why sleepest thou? \* awake, and be not absent from us for
ever.\
24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, \* and forgettest our misery and
trouble?\
25 For our soul is brought low, even unto the dust; \* our belly
cleaveth unto the ground.\
26 Arise, and help us, \* and deliver us, for thy mercy\'s sake.\

**Psalm 45. Eructavit cor meum.**\
MY heart overfloweth with a good matter; I speak the things which I have
made concerning the King. \* My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.\
2 Thou art fairer than the children of men; \* full of grace are thy
lips, because God hath blessed thee for ever.\
3 Gird thee with thy sword upon thy thigh, O thou Most Mighty, \*
according to thy worship and renown.\
4 Good luck have thou with thine honour: \* ride on, because of the word
of truth, of meekness, and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach
thee terrible things.\
5 Thy arrows are very sharp in the heart of the King\'s enemies, \* and
the people shall be subdued unto thee.\
6 Thy seat, O God, endureth for ever; \* the sceptre of thy kingdom is a
right sceptre.\
7 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; \* wherefore God,
even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy
fellows.\
8 All thy garments smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia; \* out of the
ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.\
9 Kings\' daughters are among thy honourable women; \* upon thy right
hand doth stand the queen in a vesture of gold, wrought about with
divers colours.\
10 Hearken, O daughter, and consider; incline thine ear; \* forget also
thine own people, and thy father\'s house.\
11 So shall the King have pleasure in thy beauty; \* for he is thy Lord,
and worship thou him.\
12 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; \* like as the
rich also among the people shall make their supplication before thee.\
13 The King\'s daughter is all glorious within; \* her clothing is of
wrought gold.\
14 She shall be brought unto the King in raiment of needlework: \* the
virgins that be her fellows shall bear her company, and shall be brought
unto thee.\
15 With joy and gladness shall they be brought, \* and shall enter into
the King\'s palace.\
16 Instead of thy fathers, thou shalt have children, \* whom thou mayest
make princes in all lands.\
17 I will make thy Name to be remembered from one generation to another;
\* therefore shall the people give thanks unto thee, world without end.\

**Psalm 46. Deus noster refugium.**\
GOD is our hope and strength, \* a very present help in trouble.\
2 Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be moved, \* and though
the hills be carried into the midst of the sea;\
3 Though the waters thereof rage and swell, \* and though the mountains
shake at the tempest of the same.\
4 There is a river, the streams whereof make glad the city of God; \*
the holy place of the tabernacle of the Most Highest.\
5 God is in the midst of her, therefore shall she not be removed; \* God
shall help her, and that right early.\
6 The nations make much ado, and the kingdoms are moved; \* but God hath
showed his voice, and the earth shall melt away.\
7 The LORD of hosts is with us; \* the God of Jacob is our refuge.\
8 O come hither, and behold the works of the LORD, \* what destruction
he hath brought upon the earth.\
9 He maketh wars to cease in all the world; \* he breaketh the bow, and
knappeth the spear in sunder, and burneth the chariots in the fire.\
10 Be still then, and know that I am God: \* I will be exalted among the
nations, and I will be exalted in the earth.\
11 The LORD of hosts is with us; \* the God of Jacob is our refuge.
