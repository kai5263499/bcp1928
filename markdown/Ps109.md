  PSALM +\
  \
  **Psalm 109. Deus, laudem.**\
  HOLD not thy tongue, O God of my praise; \* for the mouth of the
  ungodly, yea, the mouth of the deceitful is opened upon me.\
  2 And they have spoken against me with false tongues; \* they compassed
  me about also with words of hatred, and fought against me without a
  cause.\
  3 For the love that I had unto them, lo, they take now my contrary
  part; \* but I give myself unto prayer.\
  4 Thus have they rewarded me evil for good, \* and hatred for my good
  will.\
  5 Set thou an ungodly man to be ruler over him, \* and let an adversary
  stand at his right hand.\
  6 When sentence is given upon him, let him be condemned; \* and let his
  prayer be turned into sin.\
  7 Let his days be few; \* and let another take his office.\
  8 Let his children be fatherless, \* and his wife a widow.\
  9 Let his children be vagabonds, and beg their bread; \* let them seek
  it also out of desolate places.\
  10 Let the extortioner consume all that he hath; \* and let the
  stranger spoil his labour.\
  11 Let there be no man to pity him, \* nor to have compassion upon his
  fatherless children.\
  12 Let his posterity be destroyed; \* and in the NEXT

  generation let his name be clean put out.\
  13 Let the wickedness of his fathers be had in remembrance in the sight
  of the LORD; \* and let not the sin of his mother be done away.\
  14 Let them alway be before the LORD, \* that he may root out the
  memorial of them from off the earth;\
  15 And that, because his mind was not to do good; \* but persecuted the
  poor helpless man, that he might slay him that was vexed at the heart.\
  16 His delight was in cursing, and it shall happen unto him; \* he
  loved not blessing, therefore shall it be far from him.\
  17 He clothed himself with cursing like as with a raiment, \* and it
  shall come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.\
  18 Let it be unto him as the cloak that he hath upon him, \* and as the
  girdle that he is alway girded withal.\
  19 Let it thus happen from the LORD unto mine enemies, \* and to those
  that speak evil against my soul.\
  20 But deal thou with me, O LORD God, according unto thy Name; \* for
  sweet is thy mercy.\
  21 O deliver me, for I am helpless and poor, \~ and my heart is wounded
  within me.\
  22 I go hence like the shadow that departeth, \* and am driven away as
  the grasshopper.\
  23 My knees are weak through fasting; \* my flesh is dried up for want
  of fatness.\
  24 I am become also a reproach unto them: \* they that look upon me
  shake their heads.\
  25 Help me, O LORD my God; \* O save me according to thy mercy;\
  26 And they shall know how that this is thy hand, \* and that thou,
  LORD, hast done it.\
  27 Though they curse, yet bless thou; \* and let them be confounded
  that rise up against me; but let thy servant rejoice.\
  28 Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame; \* and let them cover
  themselves with their own confusion, as with a cloak.\
  29 As for me, I will give great thanks unto the LORD with my mouth, \*
  and praise him among the multitude;\
  30 For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, \* to save his
  soul from unrighteous judges.
