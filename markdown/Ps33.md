| \                                                                     |

| **Psalms 33. Exultate, justi.**\                                      |
| REJOICE in the LORD, O ye righteous; \* for it becometh well the just |
| to be thankful.\                                                      |
| 2 Praise the LORD with harp; \* sing praises unto him with the lute,  |
| and instrument of ten strings.\                                       |
| 3 Sing unto the Lord a new song; \* sing praises lustily unto him     |
| with a good courage.\                                                 |
| 4 For the word of the LORD is true; \* and all his works are          |
| faithful.\                                                            |
| 5 He loveth righteousness and judgment; \* the earth is full of the   |
| goodness of the LORD.\                                                |
| 6 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; \* and all the host  |
| of them by the breath of his mouth.\                                  |
| 7 He gathereth the waters of the sea together, as it were upon an     |
| heap; \* and layeth up the deep, as in a treasure-house.\             |
| 8 Let all the earth fear the LORD: \* stand in awe of him, all ye     |
| that dwell in the world.\                                             |
| 9 For he spake, and it was done; \* he commanded, and it stood fast.\ |
| 10 The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought, \* and     |
| maketh the devices of the people to be of none effect, and casteth    |
| out the counsels of princes.\                                         |
| 11 The counsel of the LORD shall endure for ever, \* and the thoughts |
| of his heart from generation to generation.\                          |
| 12 Blessed are the people whose God is the Lord JEHOVAH; \* and       |
| blessed are the folk that he hath chosen to him, to be his            |
| inheritance.\                                                         |
| 13 The LORD looketh down from heaven, and beholdeth all the children  |
| of men; \* from the habitation of his dwelling, he considereth all    |
| them that dwell on the earth.\                                        |
| 14 He fashioneth all the hearts of them, \* and understandeth all     |
| their works.\                                                         |
| 15 There is no king that can be saved by the multitude of an host; \* |
| neither is any mighty man delivered by much strength.\                |
| 16 A horse is counted but a vain thing to save a man; \* neither      |
| shall he deliver any man by his great strength.\                      |
| 17 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, \* and     |
| upon them that put their trust in his mercy;\                         |
| 18 To deliver their soul from death, \* and to feed them in the time  |
| of dearth.\                                                           |
| 19 Our soul hath patiently tarried for the LORD; \* for he is our     |
| help and our shield.\                                                 |
| 20 For our heart shall rejoice in him; \* because we have hoped in    |
| his holy Name.\                                                       |
| 21 Let thy merciful kindness, O LORD, be upon us, \* like as we do    |
| put our trust in thee.                                                |
