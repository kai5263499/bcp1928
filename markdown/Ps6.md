| **Psalms 6. Domine, ne in furore.**\                                  |
| O LORD, rebuke me not in thine indignation, \* neither chasten me in  |
| thy displeasure.\                                                     |
| 2 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am weak; \* O LORD, heal me, for  |
| my bones are vexed.\                                                  |
| 3 My soul also is sore troubled: \* but, LORD, how long wilt thou     |
| punish me?\                                                           |
| 4 Turn thee, O LORD, and deliver my soul; \* O save me, for thy       |
| mercy\'s sake.\                                                       |
| 5 For in death no man remembereth thee; \* and who will give thee     |
| thanks in the pit?\                                                   |
| 6 I am weary of my groaning; \* every night wash I my bed, and water  |
| my couch with my tears.\                                              |
| 7 My beauty is gone for very trouble, \* and worn away because of all |
| mine enemies.\                                                        |
| 8 Away from me, all ye that work iniquity; \* for the LORD hath heard |
| the voice of my weeping.\                                             |
| 9 The LORD hath heard my petition; \* the LORD will receive my        |
| prayer.\                                                              |
| 10 All mine enemies shall be confounded, and sore vexed; \* they      |
| shall be turned back, and put to shame suddenly.                      |
