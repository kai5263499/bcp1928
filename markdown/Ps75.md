| **Psalm 75. Confitebimur tibi.**\                                     |
| UNTO thee, O God, do we give thanks; \* yea, unto thee do we give     |
| thanks.\                                                              |
| 2 Thy Name also is so nigh; \* and that do thy wondrous works         |
| declare.\                                                             |
| 3 In the appointed time, saith God, \* I shall judge according unto   |
| right.\                                                               |
| 4 The earth is weak, and all the inhabiters thereof: \* I bear up the |
| pillars of it.\                                                       |
| 5 I said unto the fools, Deal not so madly; \* and to the ungodly,    |
| Set not up your horn.\                                                |
| 6 Set not up your horn on high, \* and speak not with a stiff neck.\  |
| 7 For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, \*   |
| nor yet from the south.\                                              |
| 8 And why? God is the Judge; \* he putteth down one, and setteth up   |
| another.\                                                             |
| 9 For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; \* |
| it is full mixt, and he poureth out of the same.\                     |
| 10 As for the dregs thereof, \* all the ungodly of the earth shall    |
| drink them, and suck them out.\                                       |
| 11 But I will talk of the God of Jacob, \* and praise him for ever.\  |
| 12 All the horns of the ungodly also will I break, \* and the horns   |
| of the righteous shall be exalted                                     |
