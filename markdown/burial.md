| ###### *¶ The Minister, meeting the Body, and going before            |

| I AM the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth |

| \                                                                     |
| We brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry    |

| ###### *¶ After they                                                  |
|  are come into the Church, shall be said one or more of the following |
|  Selections, taken from the Psalms. The Gloria Patri may be omitted e |
| xcept at the end of the whole portion or selection from the Psalter.* |
|                                                                       |
| *Dixi, custodiam.* Psalm xxxix.                                       |
|                                                                       |
| LORD, let me know mine end, and the number of my days; \* that I may  |
| be certified how long I have to live.\                                |
| Behold, thou hast made my days as it were a span long, and mine age   |
| is even as nothing in respect of thee; \* and verily every man living |
| is altogether vanity.\                                                |
| For man walketh in a vain shadow, and disquieteth himself in vain; \* |
| he heapeth up riches, and cannot tell who shall gather them.\         |
| And now, Lord, what is my hope? \* truly my hope is even in thee.\    |
| Deliver me from all mine offences; \* and make me not a rebuke unto   |
| the foolish.\                                                         |
| When thou with rebukes dost chasten man for sin, thou makest his      |
| beauty to consume away, like as it were a moth fretting a garment: \* |
| every man therefore is but vanity.\                                   |
| Hear my prayer, O LORD, and with thine ears consider my calling; \*   |
| hold not thy peace at my tears;\                                      |
| For I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, \* as all my fathers  |
| were.\                                                                |
| O spare me a little, that I may recover my strength, \* before I go   |
| hence, and be no more seen.\                                          |
|                                                                       |
| *Domine, refugium.* Psalm xc.                                         |
|                                                                       |
| LORD, thou hast been our refuge, \* from one generation to another.\  |
| Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and the    |
| world were made, \* thou art God from everlasting, and world without  |
| end.\                                                                 |
| Thou turnest man to destruction; \* again thou sayest, Come again, ye |
| children of men.\                                                     |
| For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday, when it is    |
| past, \* and as a watch in the night.\                                |
| As soon as thou scatterest them they are even as a sleep; \* and fade |
| away suddenly like the grass.\                                        |
| In the morning it is green, and groweth up; \* but in the evening it  |
| is cut down, dried up, and withered.\                                 |
| For we consume away in thy displeasure, \* and are afraid at thy      |
| wrathful indignation.\                                                |
| Thou hast set our misdeeds before thee; \* and our secret sins in the |
| light of thy countenance.\                                            |
| For when thou art angry all our days are gone: \* we bring our years  |
| to an end, as it were a tale that is told.\                           |
| The days of our age are threescore years and ten; and though men be   |
| so strong that they come to fourscore years, \* yet is their strength |
| then but labour and sorrow; so soon passeth it away, and we are       |
| gone.\                                                                |
| So teach us to number our days, \* that we may apply our hearts unto  |
| wisdom.\                                                              |
|                                                                       |
| *Dominus illuininatio.* Psalm xxvii.                                  |
|                                                                       |
| THE LORD is my light and my salvation; whom then shall I fear? \* the |
| LORD is the strength of my life; of whom then shall I be afraid?\     |
| One thing have I desired of the LORD, which I will require; \* even   |
| that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to |
| behold the fair beauty of the LORD, and to visit his temple.\         |
| For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his tabernacle; \*     |
| yea, in the secret place of his dwelling shall he hide me, and set me |
| up upon a rock of stone.\                                             |
| And now shall he lift up mine head \* above mine enemies round about  |
| me.\                                                                  |
| Therefore will I offer in his dwelling an oblation, with great        |
| gladness: \* I will sing and speak praises unto the LORD.\            |
| Hearken unto my voice, O LORD, when I cry unto thee; \* have mercy    |
| upon me, and hear me.\                                                |
| My heart hath talked of thee, Seek ye my face: \* Thy face, LORD,     |
| will I seek.\                                                         |
| O hide not thou thy face from me, \* nor cast thy servant away in     |
| displeasure.\                                                         |
| Thou hast been my succour; \* leave me not, neither forsake me, O God |
| of my salvation.\                                                     |
| I should utterly have fainted, \* but that I believe verily to see    |
| the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.\                  |
| O tarry thou the LORD\'S leisure; \* be strong, and he shall comfort  |
| thine heart; and put thou thy trust in the LORD.\                     |
|                                                                       |
| *Deus noster refugium.* Psalm xlvi.                                   |
|                                                                       |
| GOD is our hope and strength, \* a very present help in trouble.\     |
| Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be moved, \* and though  |
| the hills be carried into the midst of the sea;\                      |
| Though the waters thereof rage and swell, \* and though the mountains |
| shake at the tempest of the same.\                                    |
| There is a river, the streams whereof make glad the city of God; \*   |
| the holy place of the tabernacle of the Most Highest.\                |
| God is in the midst of her, therefore shall she not be removed; \*    |
| God shall help her, and that right early.\                            |
| Be still then, and know that I am God: \* I will be exalted among the |
| nations, and I will be exalted in the earth.\                         |
| The LORD of hosts is with us; \* the God of Jacob is our refuge.\     |
|                                                                       |
| *Levavi oculos.* Psalm cxxi.                                          |

| I WILL lift up mine eyes unto the hills; \* from whence cometh my     |
| help?\                                                                |
| My help cometh even from the LORD, \* who hath made heaven and        |
| earth.\                                                               |
| He will not suffer thy foot to be moved; \* and he that keepeth thee  |
| will not sleep.\                                                      |
| Behold, he that keepeth Israel \* shall neither slumber nor sleep.\   |
| The LORD himself is thy keeper; \* the LORD is thy defence upon thy   |
| right hand;\                                                          |
| So that the sun shall not burn thee by day, \* neither the moon by    |

| who may abide it?\                                                    |

| ###### *¶ Then shall follow the Lesson, taken out of the fi           |
| fteenth Chapter of the first Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians.* |
|                                                                       |
| **1 Corinthians xv. 20.**                                             |
|                                                                       |
| NOW is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them |
| that slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the         |
| resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ   |
| shall all be made alive. But every man in his own order: Christ the   |
| firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ\'s at his coming. Then    |
| cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God,   |
| even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all         |
| authority and power. For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies  |
| under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. For  |
| he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things   |
| are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put  |
| all things under him. And when all things shall be subdued unto him,  |
| then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all      |
| things under him, that God may be all in all.\                        |
| \                                                                     |
| But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body |
| do they come? Thou foolish one, that which thou sowest is not         |
| quickened, except it die: and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not |
| that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or   |
| of some other grain: but God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, |
| and to every seed its own body. All flesh is not the same flesh: but  |
| there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another   |
| of fishes, and another of birds. There are also celestial bodies, and |
| bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the    |
| glory of the terrestrial is another. There is one glory of the sun,   |
| and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for    |
| one star differeth from another star in glory. So also is the         |
| resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in   |
| incorruption: it is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is   |
| sown in weakness; it is raised in power: it is sown a natural body;   |
| it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is  |
| a spiritual body. And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a |
| living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit. Howbeit that |
| was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and      |
| afterward that which is spiritual. The first man is of the earth,     |
| earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven. As is the earthy,     |
| such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are  |
| they also that are heavenly. And as we have borne the image of the    |
| earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.\                |
| \                                                                     |
| Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the     |
| kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. Behold, |
| I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be     |
| changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump:  |
| for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised             |
| incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put |
| on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when     |
| this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal      |
| shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the      |
| saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death,    |
| where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death |
| is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God,     |
| which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, |
| my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in  |
| the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in |
| vain in the Lord.                                                     |
|                                                                       |

| AS many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.    |
| For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye  |
| have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.   |
| The Spirit himself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the   |
| children of God: and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and       |
| jointheirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may |
| be also glorified together. For I reckon that the sufferings of this  |
| present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall |
| be revealed in us. For the earnest expectation of the creature        |
| waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. We know that all    |
| things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are  |
| the called according to his purpose. What shall we then say to these  |
| things? If God be for us, who can be against us? He that spared not   |
| his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with   |
| him also freely give us all things? Who is he that condemneth? It is  |
| Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the |
| right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. Who shall     |
| separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress,  |
| or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? Nay, in  |
| all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved   |
| us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor |
| principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,   |
| nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to       |
| separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.  |

| And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and       |

| whither I go ye know, and the way ye know. Thomas saith unto him,     |
| Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?    |
| Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man   |
| cometh unto the Father, but by me.                                    |

| Resurrection unto eternal life, through our Lord Jesus Christ; at     |
| whose coming in glorious majesty to judge the world, the sea shall    |
| give up her dead; and the corruptible bodies of those who sleep in    |
| him shall be changed, and made like unto his glorious body; according |
| to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all things unto    |
| himself.\                                                             |
