THE FORM AND MANNER\
OF ORDERING PRIESTS

###### *¶ When the day appointed by the Bishop is come, there shall be a Sermon or Exhortation, declaring the Duty and Office of such as come to be admitted Priests; how necessary that Order is in the Church of Christ, and also, how the People ought to esteem them in their Office.  ¶ A Priest shall present unto the Bishop, sitting in his chair near to the Holy Table, all those who are to receive the Order of Priesthood that day, each of them being decently habited, and shall say,*

\
REVEREND Father in God, I present unto you these persons present, to be
admitted to the Order of Priesthood.

*¶ The Bishop.*

\
TAKE heed that the persons, whom ye present unto us, be apt and meet,
for their learning and godly conversation, to exercise their Ministry
duly, to the honour of God, and the edifying of his Church.

*¶ The Priest shall answer,*

\
I HAVE inquired concerning them, and also examined them, and think them
so to be.

*¶ Then the Bishop shall say unto the People,*

\
GOOD People, these are they whom we purpose, God willing, to receive
this day unto the holy Office of Priesthood; for, after due examination,
we find not to the contrary, but that they are lawfully called to their
Function and Ministry, and that they are persons meet for the same. But
yet, if there be any of you who knoweth any Impediment, or notable
Crime, in any of them, for the which he ought not to be received into
this holy Ministry, let him come forth in the Name of God, and show what
the Crime or Impediment is.

###### *¶ And if any great Crime or Impediment be objected, the Bishop shall cease from Ordering that person, until such time as the party accused shall be found clear of that Crime.  ¶ Then the Bishop (commending such as shall be found meet to be Ordered, to the Prayers of the congregation) shall, with the Clergy and People present, say the Litany.  ¶ And NOTE, That after the Suffrage, That it may please thee to illuminate all Bishops, etc., shall be said the following Suffrage:*

\
THAT it may please thee to bless these thy servants, now to be admitted
to the Order of Priests, and to pour thy grace upon them; that they may
duly exercise their Office, to the edifying of thy Church, and the glory
of thy holy Name;

###### * ¶ And NOTE further, That in the discretion of the Bishop, instead of the Litany appointed, may be said the Litany for Ordinations.  ¶ Then shall be said the Service for the Communion, with the Collect, Epistle, and Gospel, as followeth.*

The Collect.

ALMIGHTY God, giver of all good things, who by thy Holy Spirit hast
appointed divers Orders of Ministers in thy Church; Mercifully behold
these thy servants now called to the Office of Priesthood; and so
replenish them with the truth of thy Doctrine, and adorn them with
innocency of life, that, both by word and good example, they may
faithfully serve thee in this Office, to the glory of thy Name, and the
edification of thy Church; through the merits of our Saviour Jesus
Christ, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the same Holy Spirit,
world without end. Amen.\

The Epistle. *Ephesians iv. 7.*

UNTO every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift
of Christ. Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led
captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. (Now that he ascended, what
is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the
earth? He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all
heavens, that he might fill all things.) And he gave some, apostles; and
some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;
for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the
edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come in the unity of the
faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto
the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.\

The Gospel. *St. Matthew ix. 36.*

WHEN Jesus saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them,
because they fainted, and were scattered abroad as sheep having no
shepherd. Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is
plenteous, but the labourers are few; pray ye therefore the Lord of the
harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.

*¶ Or else.*

The Gospel. *St. John x. 1.*

VERILY, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into
the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a
robber. But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the
sheep. To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he
calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. And when he putteth
forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for
they know his voice. And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee
from him: for they know not the voice of strangers. This parable spake
Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he
spake unto them. Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say
unto you, I am the door of the sheep. All that ever came before me are
thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them. I am the door: by
me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and
find pasture. The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and
to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might
have it more abundantly. I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd
giveth his life for the sheep. But he that is an hireling, and not the
shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and
leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and
scattereth the sheep. The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling,
and careth not for the sheep. I am the good shepherd; and know my sheep,
and am known of mine, even as the Father knoweth me, and I know the
Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep. And other sheep I have,
which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear
my voice; and there shall be one flock, and one shepherd.

###### *¶ Then, the People being seated, the Bishop shall say unto those who are to be ordained Priests as followeth.*

\
YE have heard, Brethren, as well in your private examination, as in the
exhortation which was now made to you, and in the holy Lessons taken out
of the Gospel, and the writings of the Apostles, of what dignity, and of
how great importance this Office is, whereunto ye are called. And now
again we exhort you, in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye have
in remembrance, into how high a Dignity, and to how weighty an Office
and Charge ye are called: that is to say, to be Messengers, Watchmen,
and Stewards of the Lord; to teach, and to premonish, to feed and
provide for the Lord\'s family; to seek for Christ\'s sheep that are
dispersed abroad, and for his children who are in the midst of this
naughty world, that they may be saved through Christ for ever.\
\
Have always therefore printed in your remembrance, how great a treasure
is committed to your charge. For they are the sheep of Christ, which he
bought with his death, and for whom he shed his blood. The Church and
Congregation whom you must serve, is his Spouse, and his Body. And if it
shall happen that the same Church, or any Member thereof, do take any
hurt or hindrance by reason of your negligence, ye know the greatness of
the fault, and also the horrible punishment that will ensue. Wherefore
consider with yourselves the end of the Ministry towards the children of
God, towards the Spouse and Body of Christ; and see that ye never cease
your labour, your care and diligence, until ye have done all that lieth
in you, according to your bounden duty, to bring all such as are or
shall be committed to your charge, unto that agreement in the faith and
knowledge of God, and to that ripeness and perfectness of age in Christ,
that there be no place left among you, either for error in religion, or
for viciousness in life.\
\
Forasmuch then as your Office is both of so great excellency, and of so
great difficulty, ye see with how great care and study ye ought to apply
yourselves, as well to show yourselves dutiful and thankful unto that
Lord, who hath placed you in so high a dignity; as also to beware that
neither you yourselves offend, nor be occasion that others offend.
Howbeit, ye cannot have a mind and will thereto of yourselves; for that
will and ability is given of God alone: therefore ye ought, and have
need, to pray earnestly for his Holy Spirit. And seeing that ye cannot
by any other means compass the doing of so weighty a work, pertaining to
the salvation of man, but with doctrine and exhortation taken out of the
Holy Scriptures, and with a life agreeable to the same; consider how
studious ye ought to be in reading and learning the Scriptures, and in
framing the manners both of yourselves, and of them that specially
pertain unto you, according to the rule of the same Scriptures; and for
this self-same cause, how ye ought to forsake and set aside, as much as
ye may, all worldly cares and studies.\
\
We have good hope that ye have well weighed these things with
yourselves, long before this time; and that ye have clearly determined,
by God\'s grace, to give yourselves wholly to this Office, whereunto it
hath pleased God to call you: so that, as much as lieth in you, ye will
apply yourselves wholly to this one thing, and draw all your cares and
studies this way; and that ye will continually pray to God the Father,
by the mediation of our only Saviour Jesus Christ, for the heavenly
assistance of the Holy Ghost; that, by daily reading and weighing the
Scriptures, ye may wax riper and stronger in your Ministry; and that ye
may so endeavour yourselves, from time to time, to sanctify the lives of
you and yours, and to fashion them after the Rule and Doctrine of
Christ, that ye may be wholesome and godly examples and patterns for the
people to follow.\
\
And now, that this present Congregation of Christ may also understand
your minds and wills in these things, and that this your promise may the
more move you to do your duties; ye shall answer plainly to these
things, which we, in the Name of God, and of his Church, shall demand of
you touching the same.\
\
DO you think in your heart, that you are truly called, according to the
will of our Lord Jesus Christ, and according to the Canons of this
Church, to the Order and Ministry of Priesthood?\
**Answer.** I think it.\
\
**Bishop.** Are you persuaded that the Holy Scriptures contain all
Doctrine required as necessary for eternal salvation through faith in
Jesus Christ? And are you determined, out of the said Scriptures to
instruct the people committed to your charge; and to teach nothing, as
necessary to eternal salvation, but that which you shall be persuaded
may be concluded and proved by the Scripture?\
**Answer.** I am so persuaded, and have so determined, by God\'s grace.\
\
**Bishop.** Will you then give your faithful diligence always so to
minister the Doctrine and Sacraments, and the Discipline of Christ, as
the Lord hath commanded, and as this Church hath received the same,
according to the Commandments of God; so that you may teach the people
committed to your Cure and Charge with all diligence to keep and observe
the same?\
**Answer.** I will so do, by the help of the Lord.\
\
**Bishop.** Will you be ready, with all faithful diligence, to banish
and drive away from the Church all erroneous and strange doctrines
contrary to God\'s Word; and to use both public and private monitions
and exhortations, as well to the sick as to the whole, within your
Cures, as need shall require, and occasion shall be given?\
**Answer.** I will, the Lord being my helper.\
\
**Bishop.** Will you be diligent in Prayers, and in reading the Holy
Scriptures, and in such studies as help to the knowledge of the same,
laying aside the study of the world and the flesh?\
**Answer.** I will endeavour so to do, the Lord being my helper.\
\
**Bishop.** Will you be diligent to frame and fashion your own selves,
and your families, according to the Doctrine of Christ; and to make both
yourselves and them, as much as in you lieth, wholesome examples and
patterns to the flock of Christ?\
**Answer.** I will apply myself thereto, the Lord being my helper.\
\
**Bishop.** Will you maintain and set forwards, as much as lieth in you,
quietness, peace, and love, among all Christian people, and especially
among them that are or shall be committed to your charge?\
**Answer.** I will so do, the Lord being my helper.\
\
**Bishop.** Will you reverently obey your Bishop, and other chief
Ministers, who, according to the Canons of the Church, may have the
charge and government over you; following with a glad mind and will
their godly admonitions, and submitting yourselves to their godly
judgments?\
**Answer.** I will so do, the Lord being my helper.

¶ Then, all standing, shall the Bishop say,

\
ALMIGHTY God, who hath given you this will to do all these things; Grant
also unto you strength and power to perform the same, that he may
accomplish his work which he hath begun in you; through Jesus Christ our
Lord. Amen.

###### * ¶ After this, the Congregation shall be desired, secretly in their Prayers, to make their humble supplications to God for all these things; for the which Prayers there shall be silence kept for a space.  ¶ After which, the Persons to be ordained Priests kneeling, and others standing, the Bishop shall sing or say the Veni, Creator Spiritus; the Bishop beginning, and the Priests, and others that are present, answering by verses, as followeth.*

*Veni, Creator Spiritus.*\
COME, Holy Ghost, our souls inspire,\
And lighten with celestial fire.\
Thou the anointing Spirit art,\
Who dost thy sevenfold gifts impart.\
\
Thy blessed unction from above,\
Is comfort, life, and fire of love.\
Enable with perpetual light\
The dulness of our blinded sight.\
\
Anoint and cheer our soiled face\
With the abundance of thy grace.\
Keep far our foes, give peace at home;\
Where thou art guide, no ill can come.\
\
Teach us to know the Father, Son,\
And thee, of both, to be but One;\
That, through the ages all along,\
This may be our endless song:\
Praise to thy eternal merit,\
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

*¶ Or this.*

COME, Holy Ghost, Creator blest,\
Vouchsafe within our souls to rest;\
Come with thy grace and heavenly aid,\
And fill the hearts which thou hast made.\
\
To thee, the Comforter, we cry;\
To thee, the Gift of God most high;\
The Fount of life, the Fire of love,\
The soul\'s Anointing from above.\
\
The sevenfold gifts of grace are thine,\
O Finger of the Hand Divine;\
True Promise of the Father thou,\
Who dost the tongue with speech endow.\
\
Thy light to every sense impart,\
And shed thy love in every heart;\
Thine own unfailing might supply\
To strengthen our infirmity.\
\
Drive far away our ghostly foe,\
And thine abiding peace bestow;\
If thou be our preventing Guide,\
No evil can our steps betide.

*¶ That done, the Bishop shall pray in this wise, and say,*

\
Let us pray.

ALMIGHTY God, and heavenly Father, who, of thine infinite love and
goodness towards us, hast given to us thy only and most dearly beloved
Son Jesus Christ, to be our Redeemer, and the Author of everlasting
life; who, after he had made perfect our redemption by his death, and
was ascended into heaven, sent abroad into the world his Apostles,
Prophets, Evangelists, Doctors, and Pastors; by whose labour and
ministry he gathered together a great flock in all the parts of the
world, to set forth the eternal praise of thy holy Name: For these so
great benefits of thy eternal goodness, and for that thou hast
vouchsafed to call these thy servants here present to the same Office
and Ministry, appointed for the salvation of mankind, we render unto
thee most hearty thanks, we praise and worship thee; and we humbly
beseech thee, by the same thy blessed Son, to grant unto all, which
either here or elsewhere call upon thy holy Name, that we may continue
to show ourselves thankful unto thee for these and all thy other
benefits; and that we may daily increase and go forwards in the
knowledge and faith of thee and thy Son, by the Holy Spirit. So that as
well by these thy Ministers, as by them over whom they shall be
appointed thy Ministers, thy holy Name may be for ever glorified, and
thy blessed kingdom enlarged; through the same thy Son Jesus Christ our
Lord, who liveth and reigneth with thee in the unity of the same Holy
Spirit, world without end. Amen.

###### *¶ When this Prayer is done, the Bishop with the Priests present, shall lay their Hands severally upon the Head of every one that receiveth the Order of Priesthood; the Receivers humbly kneeling, and the Bishop saying,*

\
RECEIVE the Holy Ghost for the Office and Work of a Priest in the Church
of God, now committed unto thee by the Imposition of our hands. Whose
sins thou dost forgive, they are forgiven; and whose sins thou dost
retain, they are retained. And be thou a faithful Dispenser of the Word
of God, and of his holy Sacraments; In the Name of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

*¶ Or this.*

\
TAKE thou Authority to execute the Office of a Priest in the Church of
God, now committed to thee by the Imposition of our hands. And be thou a
faithful Dispenser of the Word of God, and of his holy Sacraments; In
the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

###### * ¶ Then the Bishop shall deliver to every one of them kneeling, the Bible into his hand, saying,*

\
TAKE thou Authority to preach the Word of God, and to minister the holy
Sacraments in the Congregation, where thou shalt be lawfully appointed
thereunto.

###### *¶ When this is done, the Nicene Creed shall be said, and the Bishop shall go on in the Service of the Communion, which all they who receive Orders shall take together, and remain in the same place where Hands were laid upon them, until such time as they have received the Communion.  ¶ The Communion being done, after the last Collect, and immediately before the Benediction, shall be said this Collect.*

\
MOST merciful Father, we beseech thee to send upon these thy servants
thy heavenly blessing; that they may be clothed with righteousness, and
that thy Word spoken by their mouths may have such success, that it may
never be spoken in vain. Grant also, that we may have grace to hear and
receive what they shall deliver out of thy most holy Word, or agreeable
to the same, as the means of our salvation; that in all our words and
deeds we may seek thy glory, and the increase of thy kingdom; through
Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\
\
THE Peace of God, which passeth all understanding, keep your hearts and
minds in the knowledge and love of God, and of his Son Jesus Christ our
Lord: And the Blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Ghost, be amongst you, and remain with you always. Amen

###### *¶ And if, on the same day, the Order of Deacons be given to some, and the Order of Priesthood to others; the Deacons shall be first presented, and then the Priests; and it shall suffice that the Litany be once said for both. The Epistle shall be Ephesians iv.7 to 13, as before in this Office. Immediately after which, they that are to be made Deacons, shall be examined and Ordained, as is above prescribed. Then one of them having read the Gospel, (which shall be either Saint Matthew ix. 36 to 38, as before in this Office; or else Saint Luke xii. 35 to 38, as before in the Form for the Ordering of Deacons,) they that are to be made Priests shall likewise be examined and Ordained, as is in this Office before appointed. The Collect shall be as followeth.*

*The Collect.*

ALMIGHTY God, giver of all good things, who by thy Holy Spirit hast
appointed divers Orders of Ministers in thy Church; Mercifully behold
these thy servants now called to the Office of Deacon and these thy
servants now called to the Office of Priest; and so replenish them with
the truth of thy Doctrine, and adorn them with innocency of life, that,
both by word and good example, they may faithfully serve thee in their
Ministry, to the glory of thy Name, and the edification of thy Church;
through the merits of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth
with thee and the same Holy Spirit, world without end. Amen.\
