| **Psalm 133. Ecce, quam bonum!**\                                     |
| BEHOLD, how good and joyful a thing it is, \* for brethren to dwell   |
| together in unity!\                                                   |
| 2 It is like the precious oil upon the head, that ran down unto the   |
| beard, \* even unto Aaron\'s beard, and went down to the skirts of    |
| his clothing.\                                                        |
| 3 Like as the dew of Hermon, \* which fell upon the hill of Sion.\    |
| 4 For there the LORD promised his blessing, \* and life for evermore. |
