| **Psalms 43. Judica me, Deus.**\                                      |
| GIVE sentence with me, O God, and defend my cause against the ungodly |
| people; \* O deliver me from the deceitful and wicked man.\           |
| 2 For thou art the God of my strength; why hast thou put me from      |
| thee? \* and why go I so heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?\     |
| 3 O send out thy light and thy truth, that they may lead me, \* and   |
| bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy dwelling;\                    |
| 4 And that I may go unto the altar of God, even unto the God of my    |
| joy and gladness; \* and upon the harp will I give thanks unto thee,  |
| O God, my God.\                                                       |
| 5 Why art thou so heavy, O my soul? \* and why art thou so disquieted |
| within me?\                                                           |
| 6 O put thy trust in God; \* for I will yet give him thanks, which is |
| the help of my countenance, and my God.                               |
