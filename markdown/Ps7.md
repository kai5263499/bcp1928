| **Psalms 7. Domine, Deus meus.**\                                     |
| O LORD my God, in thee have I put my trust: \* save me from all them  |
| that persecute me, and deliver me;\                                   |
| 2 Lest he devour my soul like a lion, and tear it in pieces, \* while |
| there is none to help.\                                               |
| 3 O LORD my God, if I have done any such thing; \* or if there be any |
| wickedness in my hands;\                                              |
| 4 If I have rewarded evil unto him that dealt friendly with me; \*    |
| (yea, I have delivered him that without any cause is mine enemy;)\    |
| 5 Then let mine enemy persecute my soul, and take me; \* yea, let him |
| tread my life down upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust.\  |
| 6 Stand up, O LORD, in thy wrath, and lift up thyself, because of the |
| indignation of mine enemies; \* arise up for me in the judgment that  |
| thou hast commanded.\                                                 |
| 7 And so shall the congregation of the peoples come about thee: \*    |
| for their sakes therefore lift up thyself again.\                     |
| 8 The LORD shall judge the peoples: give sentence with me, O LORD, \* |
| according to my righteousness, and according to the innocency that is |
| in me.\                                                               |
| 9 O let the wickedness of the ungodly come to an end; \* but guide    |
| thou the just.\                                                       |
| 10 For the righteous God \* trieth the very hearts and reins.\        |
| 11 My help cometh of God, \* who preserveth them that are true of     |
| heart.\                                                               |
| 12 God is a righteous Judge, strong, and patient; \* and God is       |
| provoked every day.\                                                  |
| 13 If a man will not turn, he will whet his sword; \* he hath bent    |
| his bow, and made it ready.\                                          |
| 14 He hath prepared for him the instruments of death; \* he ordaineth |
| his arrows against the persecutors.\                                  |
| 15 Behold, the ungodly travaileth with iniquity; \* he hath conceived |
| mischief, and brought forth falsehood.\                               |
| 16 He hath graven and digged up a pit, \* and is fallen himself into  |
| the destruction that he made for other.\                              |
| 17 For his travail shall come upon his own head, \* and his           |
| wickedness shall fall on his own pate.\                               |
| 18 I will give thanks unto the LORD, according to his righteousness;  |
| \* and I will praise the Name of the LORD Most High.                  |
