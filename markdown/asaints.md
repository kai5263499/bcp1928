| ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, who dost enkindle the name of thy love  |

| O ALMIGHTY God, who hast called us to faith in thee, and hast         |
| compassed us about with so great a cloud of witnesses; Grant that we, |
| encouraged by the good examples of thy Saints, and especially of thy  |
| servant \[Saint\_\_\_\_\_\], may persevere in running the race that   |
| is set before us, until at length, through thy mercy, we, with them,  |
| attain to thine eternal joy; through him who is the author and        |
| finisher of our faith, thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\          |

| The Epistle. Hebrews xii. 1.                                          |

| SEEING we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of           |
| witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so   |
| easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set    |
| before us, looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith;   |
| who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising  |
| the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.\   |
|                                                                       |
| The Gospel. St. Matthew xxv. 31.                                      |
|                                                                       |
| WHEN the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels  |
| with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: and before  |
| him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one     |
| from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: and he |
| shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.     |
| Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed |
| of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the           |
| foundation of the world: for I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I |
| was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me   |
| in: naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in |
| prison, and ye came unto me. Then shall the righteous answer him,     |
| saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty,  |
| and gave thee drink? When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in?   |
| or naked, and clothed thee? Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison,   |
| and came unto thee? And the King shall answer and say unto them,      |
| Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the    |
| least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.                  |
