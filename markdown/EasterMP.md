| AT that time: On the first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene      |
| early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone  |
| taken away from the sepulchre. Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon  |
| Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto    |
| them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know |
| not where they have laid him. Peter therefore went forth, and that    |
| other disciple, and came to the sepulchre. So they ran both together: |
| and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the        |
| sepulchre. And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen        |
| clothes lying; yet went he not in. Then cometh Simon Peter following  |
| him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,    |
| and the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen     |
| clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself. Then went in also |
| that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw,   |
| and believed. For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must    |
| rise again from the dead. Then the disciples went away again unto     |
| their own home.                                                       |

| O God, who for our redemption didst give thine only-begotten Son to   |

| Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye  |
| are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:    |

| At that time: When the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the |
| mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might |
| come and anoint him.  And very early in the morning the first day of  |
| the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.  And |
| they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the |
| door of the sepulchre?  And when they looked, they saw that the stone |
| was rolled away: for it was very great.  And entering into the        |
| sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in |
| a long white garment; and they were affrighted.  And he saith unto    |
| them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was         |
| crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they   |
| laid him.  But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he      |
| goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said     |
| unto you.  And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre;    |
| for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any |
| man; for they were afraid.                                            |

| *¶ Within the Octave of Easter, Mass is not said of any double or     |
| semidouble Feast, but Doubles which can be transferred are celebrated |
| after the Octave.  But of Doubles which cannot be transferred, or     |
