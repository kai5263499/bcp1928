| 1 And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree     |
| from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.\            |
| 2 (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of       |
| Syria.)\                                                              |
| 3 And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.\             |
| 4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth,  |
| into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem;       |
| (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)\                  |
| 5 To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.\   |
| 6 And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were           |
| accomplished that she should be delivered.\                           |
| 7 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in         |
| swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no     |
| room for them in the inn.\                                            |
| 8 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field,  |
| keeping watch over their flock by night.\                             |
| 9 And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the |
| Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.\              |
| 10 And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you   |
| good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.\             |
| 11 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour,      |
| which is Christ the Lord.\                                            |
| 12 And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped  |
| in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.\                             |
| 13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly  |
| host praising God, and saying,\                                       |

| 15 And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into   |
| heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto    |
| Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord   |
| hath made known unto us.\                                             |
| 16 And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe |
| lying in a manger.\                                                   |
| 17 And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which |
| was told them concerning this child.\                                 |
| 18 And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were     |
| told them by the shepherds.\                                          |

| rest.\                                                                |

| 1 At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the  |
| greatest in the kingdom of heaven?\                                   |
| 2 And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst  |
| of them,\                                                             |
| 3 And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become |
| as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.\   |
| 4 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the  |
| same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.\                           |
| 5 And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth  |

| 6 But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in    |
| me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his     |
| neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.\              |
| 7 Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that   |
| offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!\       |
| 8 Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and    |
| cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or |
| maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into      |
| everlasting fire.\                                                    |
| 9 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee:  |
| it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than    |
| having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.\                           |
| []{#anchor1384114}10 Take heed that ye despise not one of these       |
| little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do       |
| always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.\              |
| 11 For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.\           |
| 12 How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be   |
| gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into    |
| the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?\                |
| 13 And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth  |
| more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not        |
