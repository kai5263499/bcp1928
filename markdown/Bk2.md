The Psalter or Psalms of David

**BOOK II.**

**Psalm 42. Quemadmodum.**\
LIKE as the hart desireth the water-brooks, \* so longeth my soul after
thee, O God.\
2 My soul is athirst for God, yea, even for the living God: \* when
shall I come to appear before the presence of God?\
3 My tears have been my meat day and night, \* while they daily say unto
me, Where is now thy God?\
4 Now when I think thereupon, I pour out my heart by myself; \* for I
went with the multitude, and brought them forth into the house of God;\
5 In the voice of praise and thanksgiving, \* among such as keep
holy-day.\
6 Why art thou so full of heaviness, O my soul? \* and why art thou so
disquieted within me?\
7 O put thy trust in God; \* for I will yet thank him, which is the help
of my countenance, and my God.\
8 My soul is vexed within me; \* therefore will I remember thee from the
land of Jordan, from Hermon and the little hill.\
9 One deep calleth another, because of the noise of thy water-floods; \*
all thy waves and storms are gone over me.\
10 The LORD will grant his loving-kindness in the daytime; \* and in the
night season will I sing of him, and make my prayer unto the God of my
life.\
11 I will say unto the God of my strength, Why hast thou forgotten me?
\* why go I thus heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?\
12 My bones are smitten asunder as with a sword, \* while mine enemies
that trouble me cast me in the teeth;\
13 Namely, while they say daily unto me, \* Where is now thy God?\
14 Why art thou so vexed, O my soul? \* and why art thou so disquieted
within me?\
15 O put thy trust in God; \* for I will yet thank him, which is the
help of my countenance, and my God.\
\
**\
Psalm 43. Judica me, Deus.**\
GIVE sentence with me, O God, and defend my cause against the ungodly
people; \* O deliver me from the deceitful and wicked man.\
2 For thou art the God of my strength; why hast thou put me from thee?
\* and why go I so heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?\
3 O send out thy light and thy truth, that they may lead me, \* and
bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy dwelling;\
4 And that I may go unto the altar of God, even unto the God of my joy
and gladness; \* and upon the harp will I give thanks unto thee, O God,
my God.\
5 Why art thou so heavy, O my soul? \* and why art thou so disquieted
within me?\
6 O put thy trust in God; \* for I will yet give him thanks, which is
the help of my countenance, and my God.\

The Ninth Day.\
\
Morning Prayer.

**Psalm 44. Deus, auribus.**\
WE have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us \* what
thou hast done in their time of old:\
2 How thou hast driven out the heathen with thy hand, and planted our
fathers in; \* how thou hast destroyed the nations, and made thy people
to flourish.\
3 For they gat not the land in possession through their own sword, \*
neither was it their own arm that helped them;\
4 But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance;
\* because thou hadst a favour unto them.\
5 Thou art my King, O God; \* send help unto Jacob.\
6 Through thee will we overthrow our enemies, \* and in thy Name will we
tread them under that rise up against us.\
7 For I will not trust in my bow, \* it is not my sword that shall help
me;\
8 But it is thou that savest us from our enemies, \* and puttest them to
confusion that hate us.\
9 We make our boast of God all day long, \* and will praise thy Name for
ever.\
10 But now thou art far off, and puttest us to confusion, \* and goest
not forth with our armies.\
11 Thou makest us to turn our backs upon our enemies, \* so that they
which hate us spoil our goods.\
12 Thou lettest us be eaten up like sheep, \* and hast scattered us
among the heathen.\
13 Thou sellest thy people for nought, \* and takest no money for them.\
14 Thou makest us to be rebuked of our neighbours, \* to be laughed to
scorn, and had in derision of them that are round about us.\
15 Thou makest us to be a by-word among the nations, \* and that the
peoples shake their heads at us.\
16 My confusion is daily before me, \* and the shame of my face hath
covered me;\
17 For the voice of the slanderer and blasphemer, \* for the enemy and
avenger.\
18 And though all this be come upon us, yet do we not forget thee, \*
nor behave ourselves frowardly in thy covenant.\
19 Our heart is not turned back, \* neither our steps gone out of thy
way;\
20 No, not when thou hast smitten us into the place of dragons, \* and
covered us with the shadow of death.\
21 If we have forgotten the Name of our God, and holden up our hands to
any strange god, \* shall not God search it out? for he knoweth the very
secrets of the heart.\
22 For thy sake also are we killed all the day long, \* and are counted
as sheep appointed to be slain.\
23 Up, Lord, why sleepest thou? \* awake, and be not absent from us for
ever.\
24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, \* and forgettest our misery and
trouble?\
25 For our soul is brought low, even unto the dust; \* our belly
cleaveth unto the ground.\
26 Arise, and help us, \* and deliver us, for thy mercy\'s sake.\
\
**\
Psalm 45. Eructavit cor meum.**\
MY heart overfloweth with a good matter; I speak the things which I have
made concerning the King. \* My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.\
2 Thou art fairer than the children of men; \* full of grace are thy
lips, because God hath blessed thee for ever.\
3 Gird thee with thy sword upon thy thigh, O thou Most Mighty, \*
according to thy worship and renown.\
4 Good luck have thou with thine honour: \* ride on, because of the word
of truth, of meekness, and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach
thee terrible things.\
5 Thy arrows are very sharp in the heart of the King\'s enemies, \* and
the people shall be subdued unto thee.\
6 Thy seat, O God, endureth for ever; \* the sceptre of thy kingdom is a
right sceptre.\
7 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; \* wherefore God,
even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy
fellows.\
8 All thy garments smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia; \* out of the
ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.\
9 Kings\' daughters are among thy honourable women; \* upon thy right
hand doth stand the queen in a vesture of gold, wrought about with
divers colours.\
10 Hearken, O daughter, and consider; incline thine ear; \* forget also
thine own people, and thy father\'s house.\
11 So shall the King have pleasure in thy beauty; \* for he is thy Lord,
and worship thou him.\
12 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; \* like as the
rich also among the people shall make their supplication before thee.\
13 The King\'s daughter is all glorious within; \* her clothing is of
wrought gold.\
14 She shall be brought unto the King in raiment of needlework: \* the
virgins that be her fellows shall bear her company, and shall be brought
unto thee.\
15 With joy and gladness shall they be brought, \* and shall enter into
the King\'s palace.\
16 Instead of thy fathers, thou shalt have children, \* whom thou mayest
make princes in all lands.\
17 I will make thy Name to be remembered from one generation to another;
\* therefore shall the people give thanks unto thee, world without end.\
**\
\
Psalm 46. Deus noster refugium.**\
GOD is our hope and strength, \* a very present help in trouble.\
2 Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be moved, \* and though
the hills be carried into the midst of the sea;\
3 Though the waters thereof rage and swell, \* and though the mountains
shake at the tempest of the same.\
4 There is a river, the streams whereof make glad the city of God; \*
the holy place of the tabernacle of the Most Highest.\
5 God is in the midst of her, therefore shall she not be removed; \* God
shall help her, and that right early.\
6 The nations make much ado, and the kingdoms are moved; \* but God hath
showed his voice, and the earth shall melt away.\
7 The LORD of hosts is with us; \* the God of Jacob is our refuge.\
8 O come hither, and behold the works of the LORD, \* what destruction
he hath brought upon the earth.\
9 He maketh wars to cease in all the world; \* he breaketh the bow, and
knappeth the spear in sunder, and burneth the chariots in the fire.\
10 Be still then, and know that I am God: \* I will be exalted among the
nations, and I will be exalted in the earth.\
11 The LORD of hosts is with us; \* the God of Jacob is our refuge.\

Evening Prayer.

**Psalm 47. Omnes gentes, plaudite.**\
CLAP your hands together, all ye peoples: \* O sing unto God with the
voice of melody.\
2 For the LORD is high, and to be feared; \* he is the great King upon
all the earth.\
3 He shall subdue the peoples under us, \* and the nations under our
feet.\
4 He shall choose out an heritage for us, \* even the excellency of
Jacob, whom he loved.\
5 God is gone up with a merry noise, \* and the LORD with the sound of
the trump.\
6 O sing praises, sing praises unto our God; \* O sing praises, sing
praises unto our King.\
7 For God is the King of all the earth: \* sing ye praises with
understanding.\
8 God reigneth over the nations; \* God sitteth upon his holy seat.\
9 The princes of the peoples are joined unto the people of the God of
Abraham; \* for God, which is very high exalted, doth defend the earth,
as it were with a shield.\
\
**\
Psalm 48. Magnus Dominus.**\
GREAT is the LORD, and highly to be praised \* in the city of our God,
even upon his holy hill.\
2 The hill of Sion is a fair place, and the joy of the whole earth; \*
upon the north side lieth the city of the great King: God is well known
in her palaces as a sure refuge.\
3 For lo, the kings of the earth \* were gathered, and gone by
together.\
4 They marvelled to see such things; \* they were astonished, and
suddenly cast down.\
5 Fear came there upon them; and sorrow, \* as upon a woman in her
travail.\
6 Thou dost break the ships of the sea \* through the east-wind.\
7 Like as we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of
hosts, in the city of our God; \* God upholdeth the same for ever.\
8 We wait for thy loving-kindness, O God, \* in the midst of thy
temple.\
9 O God, according to thy Name, so is thy praise unto the world\'s end;
\* thy right hand is full of righteousness.\
10 Let the mount Sion rejoice, and the daughters of Judah be glad, \*
because of thy judgments.\
11 Walk about Sion, and go round about her; \* and tell the towers
thereof.\
12 Mark well her bulwarks, consider her palaces, \* that ye may tell
them that come after.\
13 For this God is our God for ever and ever: \* he shall be our guide
unto death.\
\
**\
Psalm 49. Audite haec, omnes.**\
O HEAR ye this, all ye people; \* ponder it with your ears, all ye that
dwell in the world;\
2 High and low, rich and poor, \* one with another.\
3 My mouth shall speak of wisdom, \* and my heart shall muse of
understanding.\
4 I will incline mine ear to the parable, \* and show my dark speech
upon the harp.\
5 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, \* when wickedness at my
heels compasseth me round about?\
6 There be some that put their trust in their goods, \* and boast
themselves in the multitude of their riches.\
7 But no man may deliver his brother, \* nor give a ransom unto God for
him,\
8 (For it cost more to redeem their souls, \* so that he must let that
alone for ever;)\
9 That he shall live alway, \* and not see the grave.\
10 For he seeth that wise men also die and perish together, \* as well
as the ignorant and foolish, and leave their riches for other.\
11 And yet they think that their houses shall continue for ever, and
that their dwelling-places shall endure from one generation to another;
\* and call the lands after their own names.\
12 Nevertheless, man being in honour abideth not, \* seeing he may be
compared unto the beasts that perish;\
13 This their way is very foolishness; \* yet their posterity praise
their saying.\
14 They lie in the grave like sheep; death is their shepherd; and the
righteous shall have dominion over them in the morning: \* their beauty
shall consume in the sepulchre, and have no abiding.\
15 But God hath delivered my soul from the power of the grave; \* for he
shall receive me.\
16 Be not thou afraid, though one be made rich, \* or if the glory of
his house be increased;\
17 For he shall carry nothing away with him when he dieth, \* neither
shall his pomp follow him.\
18 For while he lived, he counted himself an happy man; \* and so long
as thou doest well unto thyself, men will speak good of thee.\
19 He shall follow the generation of his fathers, \* and shall never see
light.\
20 Man that is in honour but hath no understanding \* is compared unto
the beasts that perish.\

The Tenth Day.\
\
Morning Prayer.

**Psalm 50. Deus deorum.**\
THE LORD, even the Most Mighty God, hath spoken, \* and called the
world, from the rising up of the sun unto the going down thereof.\
2 Out of Sion hath God appeared \* in perfect beauty.\
3 Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence; \* there shall go
before him a consuming fire, and a mighty tempest shall be stirred up
round about him.\
4 He shall call the heaven from above, \* and the earth, that he may
judge his people.\
5 Gather my saints together unto me; \* those that have made a covenant
with me with sacrifice.\
6 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness; \* for God is Judge
himself.\
7 Hear, O my people, and I will speak; \* I myself will testify against
thee, O Israel; for I am God, even thy God.\
8 I will not reprove thee because of thy sacrifices; \* as for thy
burnt-offerings, they are alway before me.\
9 I will take no bullock out of thine house, \* nor he-goats out of thy
folds.\
10 For all the beasts of the forest are mine, \* and so are the cattle
upon a thousand hills.\
11 I know all the fowls upon the mountains, \* and the wild beasts of
the field are in my sight.\
12 If I be hungry, I will not tell thee; \* for the whole world is mine,
and all that is therein.\
13 Thinkest thou that I will eat bulls\' flesh, \* and drink the blood
of goats?\
14 Offer unto God thanksgiving, \* and pay thy vows unto the Most
Highest.\
15 And call upon me in the time of trouble; \* so will I hear thee, and
thou shalt praise me.\
16 But unto the ungodly saith God, \* Why dost thou preach my laws, and
takest my covenant in thy mouth;\
17 Whereas thou hatest to be reformed, \* and hast cast my words behind
thee?\
18 When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst unto him; \* and hast been
partaker with the adulterers.\
19 Thou hast let thy mouth speak wickedness, \* and with thy tongue thou
hast set forth deceit.\
20 Thou sattest and spakest against thy brother; \* yea, and hast
slandered thine own mother\'s son.\
21 These things hast thou done, and I held my tongue, and thou
thoughtest wickedly, that I am even such a one as thyself; \* but I will
reprove thee, and set before thee the things that thou hast done.\
22 O consider this, ye that forget God, \* lest I pluck you away, and
there be none to deliver you.\
23 Whoso offereth me thanks and praise, he honoureth me; \* and to him
that ordereth his way aright, will I show the salvation of God.\
\
**\
Psalm 51. Miserere mei, Deus.**\
HAVE mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness; \* according to the
multitude of thy mercies do away mine offences.\
2 Wash me throughly from my wickedness, \* and cleanse me from my sin.\
3 For I acknowledge my faults, \* and my sin is ever before me.\
4 Against thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight; \*
that thou mightest be justified in thy saying, and clear when thou shalt
judge.\
5 Behold, I was shapen in wickedness, \* and in sin hath my mother
conceived me.\
6 But lo, thou requirest truth in the inward parts, \* and shalt make me
to understand wisdom secretly.\
7 Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; \* thou shalt
wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.\
8 Thou shalt make me hear of joy and gladness, \* that the bones which
thou hast broken may rejoice.\
9 Turn thy face from my sins, \* and put out all my misdeeds.\
10 Make me a clean heart, O God, \* and renew a right spirit within me.\
11 Cast me not away from thy presence, \* and take not thy holy Spirit
from me.\
12 O give me the comfort of thy help again, \* and stablish me with thy
free Spirit.\
13 Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked, \* and sinners shall be
converted unto thee.\
14 Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou that art the God of my
health; \* and my tongue shall sing of thy righteousness.\
15 Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord, \* and my mouth shall show thy
praise.\
16 For thou desirest no sacrifice, else would I give it thee; \* but
thou delightest not in burnt-offerings.\
17 The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit: \* a broken and contrite
heart, O God, shalt thou not despise.\
18 O be favourable and gracious unto Sion; \* build thou the walls of
Jerusalem.\
19 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness, with
the burnt-offerings and oblations; \* then shall they offer young
bullocks upon thine altar.\
\
**\
Psalm 52. Quid gloriaris?**\
WHY boastest thou thyself, thou tyrant, \* that thou canst do mischief;\
2 Whereas the goodness of God \* endureth yet daily?\
3 Thy tongue imagineth wickedness, \* and with lies thou cuttest like a
sharp razor.\
4 Thou hast loved unrighteousness more than goodness, \* and falsehood
more than righteousness.\
5 Thou hast loved to speak all words that may do hurt, \* O thou false
tongue.\
6 Therefore shall God destroy thee for ever; \* he shall take thee, and
pluck thee out of thy dwelling, and root thee out of the land of the
living.\
7 The righteous also shall see this, and fear, \* and shall laugh him to
scorn:\
8 Lo, this is the man that took not God for his strength; \* but trusted
unto the multitude of his riches, and strengthened himself in his
wickedness.\
9 As for me, I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God; \* my
trust is in the tender mercy of God for ever and ever.\
10 I will alway give thanks unto thee for that thou hast done; \* and I
will hope in thy Name, for thy saints like it well.\

Evening Prayer.

**Psalm 53. Dixit insipiens.**\
THE foolish body hath said in his heart, \* There is no God.\
2 Corrupt are they, and become abominable in their wickedness; \* there
is none that doeth good.\
3 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, \* to see if
there were any that would understand, and seek after God.\
4 But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become
abominable; \* there is also none that doeth good, no not one.\
5 Are not they without understanding that work wickedness, \* eating up
my people as if they would eat bread? they have not called upon God.\
6 They were afraid where no fear was; \* for God hath broken the bones
of him that besieged thee; thou hast put them to confusion, because God
hath despised them.\
7 O that the salvation were given unto Israel out of Sion! \* O that the
Lord would deliver his people out of captivity!\
8 Then should Jacob rejoice, \* and Israel should be right glad.\
\
**\
Psalm 54. Deus, in Nomine.**\
SAVE me, O God, for thy Name\'s sake, \* and avenge me in thy strength.\
2 Hear my prayer, O God, \* and hearken unto the words of my mouth.\
3 For strangers are risen up against me; \* and tyrants, which have not
God before their eyes, seek after my soul.\
4 Behold, God is my helper; \* the Lord is with them that uphold my
soul.\
5 He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: \* destroy thou them in thy
truth.\
6 An offering of a free heart will I give thee, and praise thy Name, O
LORD; \* because it is so comfortable.\
7 For he hath delivered me out of all my trouble; \* and mine eye hath
seen his desire upon mine enemies.\
\
**\
Psalm 55. Exaudi, Deus.**\
HEAR my prayer, O God, \* and hide not thyself from my petition.\
2 Take heed unto me, and hear me, \* how I mourn in my prayer, and am
vexed;\
3 The enemy crieth so, and the ungodly cometh on so fast; \* for they
are minded to do me some mischief, so maliciously are they set against
me.\
4 My heart is disquieted within me, \* and the fear of death is fallen
upon me.\
5 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, \* and an horrible dread
hath overwhelmed me.\
6 And I said, O that I had wings like a dove! \* for then would I flee
away, and be at rest.\
7 Lo, then would I get me away far off, \* and remain in the
wilderness.\
8 I would make haste to escape, \* because of the stormy wind and
tempest.\
9 Destroy their tongues, O Lord, and divide them; \* for I have spied
unrighteousness and strife in the city.\
10 Day and night they go about within the walls thereof: \* mischief
also and sorrow are in the midst of it.\
11 Wickedness is therein; \* deceit and guile go not out of her
streets.\
12 For it is not an open enemy that hath done me this dishonour; \* for
then I could have borne it;\
13 Neither was it mine adversary that did magnify himself against me; \*
for then peradventure I would have hid myself from him;\
14 But it was even thou, my companion, \* my guide, and mine own
familiar friend.\
15 We took sweet counsel together, \* and walked in the house of God as
friends.\
16 Let death come hastily upon them, and let them go down alive into the
pit; \* for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.\
17 As for me, I will call upon God, \* and the LORD shall save me.\
18 In the evening, and morning, and at noon-day will I pray, and that
instantly; \* and he shall hear my voice.\
19 It is he that hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that
was against me; \* for there were many that strove with me.\
20 Yea, even God, that endureth for ever, shall hear me, and bring them
down; \* for they will not turn, nor fear God.\
21 He laid his hands upon such as be at peace with him, \* and he brake
his covenant.\
22 The words of his mouth were softer than butter, having war in his
heart; \* his words were smoother than oil, and yet be they very
swords.\
23 O cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall nourish thee, \* and
shall not suffer the righteous to fall for ever.\
24 And as for them, \* thou, O God, shalt bring them into the pit of
destruction.\
25 The blood-thirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their
days: \* nevertheless, my trust shall be in thee, O Lord.\

The Eleventh Day.\
\
Morning Prayer.

**Psalm 56. Miserere mei, Deus.**\
BE merciful unto me, O God, for man goeth about to devour me; \* he is
daily fighting, and troubling me.\
2 Mine enemies are daily at hand to swallow me up; \* for they be many
that fight against me, O thou Most Highest.\
3 Nevertheless, though I am sometime afraid, \* yet put I my trust in
thee.\
4 I will praise God, because of his word: \* I have put my trust in God,
and will not fear what flesh can do unto me.\
5 They daily mistake my words; \* all that they imagine is to do me
evil.\
6 They hold all together, and keep themselves close, \* and mark my
steps, when they lay wait for my soul.\
7 Shall they escape for their wickedness? \* thou, O God, in thy
displeasure shalt cast them down.\
8 Thou tellest my wanderings; put my tears into thy bottle: \* are not
these things noted in thy book?\
9 Whensoever I call upon thee, then shall mine enemies be put to flight:
\* this I know; for God is on my side.\
10 In God\'s word will I rejoice; \* in the LORD\'S word will I comfort
me.\
11 Yea, in God have I put my trust; \* I will not be afraid what man can
do unto me.\
12 Unto thee, O God, will I pay my vows; \* unto thee will I give
thanks.\
13 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, and my feet from falling,
\* that I may walk before God in the light of the living.\
\
**\
Psalm 57. Miserere mei, Deus.**\
BE merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me; for my soul trusteth in
thee; \* and under the shadow of thy wings shall be my refuge, until
this tyranny be overpast.\
2 I will call unto the Most High God, \* even unto the God that shall
perform the cause which I have in hand.\
3 He shall send from heaven, \* and save me from the reproof of him that
would eat me up.\
4 God shall send forth his mercy and truth: \* my soul is among lions;\
5 And I lie even among the children of men, that are set on fire, \*
whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.\
6 Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens; \* and thy glory above all
the earth.\
7 They have laid a net for my feet, and pressed down my soul; \* they
have digged a pit before me, and are fallen into the midst of it
themselves.\
8 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed; \* I will sing and give
praise.\
9 Awake up, my glory; awake, lute and harp: \* I myself will awake right
early.\
10 I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the peoples; \* and I
will sing unto thee among the nations.\
11 For the greatness of thy mercy reacheth unto the heavens, \* and thy
truth unto the clouds.\
12 Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens; \* and thy glory above all
the earth.\
\
**\
Psalm 58. Si vere utique.**\
ARE your minds set upon righteousness, O ye congregation? \* and do ye
judge the thing that is right, O ye sons of men?\
2 Yea, ye imagine mischief in your heart upon the earth, \* and your
hands deal with wickedness.\
3 The ungodly are froward, even from their mother\'s womb; \* as soon as
they are born, they go astray, and speak lies.\
4 They are as venomous as the poison of a serpent, \* even like the deaf
adder, that stoppeth her ears;\
5 Which refuseth to hear the voice of the charmer, \* charm he never so
wisely.\
6 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouths; \* smite the jaw-bones of
the lions, O LORD.\
7 Let them fall away like water that runneth apace; \* when they shoot
their arrows, let them be rooted out.\
8 Let them consume away like a snail, and be like the untimely fruit of
a woman; \* and let them not see the sun.\
9 Or ever your pots be made hot with thorns, \* he shall take them away
with a whirlwind, the green and the burning alike.\
10 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance; \* he shall
wash his footsteps in the blood of the ungodly.\
11 So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous;
\* doubtless there is a God that judgeth the earth.\

Evening Prayer.

**Psalm 59. Eripe me de inimicis.**\
DELIVER me from mine enemies, O God; \* defend me from them that rise up
against me.\
2 O deliver me from the wicked doers, \* and save me from the
blood-thirsty men.\
3 For lo, they lie waiting for my soul; \* the mighty men are gathered
against me, without any offence or fault of me, O LORD.\
4 They run and prepare themselves without my fault; \* arise thou
therefore to help me, and behold.\
5 Stand up, O LORD God of hosts, thou God of Israel, to visit all the
heathen, \* and be not merciful unto them that offend of malicious
wickedness.\
6 They go to and fro in the evening, \* they grin like a dog, and run
about through the city.\
7 Behold, they speak with their mouth, and swords are in their lips; \*
for who doth hear?\
8 But thou, O LORD, shalt have them in derision, \* and thou shalt laugh
all the heathen to scorn.\
9 My strength will I ascribe unto thee; \* for thou art the God of my
refuge.\
10 God showeth me his goodness plenteously; \* and God shall let me see
my desire upon mine enemies.\
11 Slay them not, lest my people forget it; \* but scatter them abroad
among the people, and put them down, O Lord our defence.\
12 For the sin of their mouth, and for the words of their lips, they
shall be taken in their pride: \* and why? their talk is of cursing and
lies.\
13 Consume them in thy wrath, consume them, that they may perish; \* and
know that it is God that ruleth in Jacob, and unto the ends of the
world.\
14 And in the evening they will return, \* grin like a dog, and will go
about the city.\
15 They will run here and there for meat, \* and grudge if they be not
satisfied.\
16 As for me, I will sing of thy power, and will praise thy mercy
betimes in the morning; \* for thou hast been my defence and refuge in
the day of my trouble.\
17 Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing; \* for thou, O God, art my
refuge, and my merciful God.\
\
**\
Psalm 60. Deus, repulisti nos.**\
O GOD, thou hast cast us out, and scattered us abroad; \* thou hast also
been displeased: O turn thee unto us again.\
2 Thou hast moved the land, and divided it: \* heal the sores thereof,
for it shaketh.\
3 Thou hast showed thy people heavy things; \* thou hast given us a
drink of deadly wine.\
4 Thou hast given a token for such as fear thee, \* that they may
triumph because of the truth.\
5 Therefore were thy beloved delivered; \* help me with thy right hand,
and hear me.\
6 God hath spoken in his holiness, I will rejoice, and divide Shechem,
\* and mete out the valley of Succoth.\
7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; \* Ephraim also is the strength
of my head; Judah is my law-giver;\
8 Moab is my wash-pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; \* Philistia,
be thou glad of me.\
9 Who will lead me into the strong city? \* who will bring me into
Edom?\
10 Hast not thou cast us out, O God? \* wilt not thou, O God, go out
with our hosts?\
11 O be thou our help in trouble; \* for vain is the help of man.\
12 Through God will we do great acts; \* for it is he that shall tread
down our enemies.\
\
**\
Psalm 61. Exaudi, Deus.**\
HEAR my crying, O God, \* give ear unto my prayer.\
2 From the ends of the earth will I call upon thee, \* when my heart is
in heaviness.\
3 O set me up upon the rock that is higher than I; \* for thou hast been
my hope, and a strong tower for me against the enemy.\
4 I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever, \* and my trust shall be
under the covering of thy wings.\
5 For thou, O Lord, hast heard my desires, \* and hast given an heritage
unto those that fear thy Name.\
6 Thou shalt grant the King a long life, \* that his years may endure
throughout all generations.\
7 He shall dwell before God for ever: \* O prepare thy loving mercy and
faithfulness, that they may preserve him.\
8 So will I alway sing praise unto thy Name, \* that I may daily perform
my vows.\

The Twelfth Day.\
\
Morning Prayer.

**Psalm 62. Nonne Deo?**\
MY soul truly waiteth still upon God; \* for of him cometh my
salvation.\
2 He verily is my strength and my salvation; \* he is my defence, so
that I shall not greatly fall.\
3 How long will ye imagine mischief against every man? \* Ye shall be
slain all the sort of you; yea, as a tottering wall shall ye be, and
like a broken hedge.\
4 Their device is only how to put him out whom God will exalt; \* their
delight is in lies; they give good words with their mouth, but curse
with their heart.\
5 Nevertheless, my soul, wait thou still upon God; \* for my hope is in
him.\
6 He truly is my strength and my salvation; \* he is my defence, so that
I shall not fall.\
7 In God is my health and my glory; \* the rock of my might; and in God
is my trust.\
8 O put your trust in him alway, ye people; \* pour out your hearts
before him, for God is our hope.\
9 As for the children of men, they are but vanity; the children of men
are deceitful; \* upon the weights they are altogether lighter than
vanity itself.\
10 O trust not in wrong and robbery; give not yourselves unto vanity: \*
if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.\
11 God spake once, and twice I have also heard the same, \* that power
belongeth unto God;\
12 And that thou, Lord, art merciful; \* for thou rewardest every man
according to his work.\
\
**\
Psalm 63. Deus, Deus meus.**\
O GOD, thou art my God; \* early will I seek thee.\
2 My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh also longeth after thee, \* in a
barren and dry land where no water is.\
3 Thus have I looked for thee in the sanctuary, \* that I might behold
thy power and glory.\
4 For thy loving-kindness is better than the life itself: \* my lips
shall praise thee.\
5 As long as I live will I magnify thee in this manner, \* and lift up
my hands in thy Name.\
6 My soul shall be satisfied, even as it were with marrow and fatness,
\* when my mouth praiseth thee with joyful lips.\
7 Have I not remembered thee in my bed, \* and thought upon thee when I
was waking?\
8 Because thou hast been my helper; \* therefore under the shadow of thy
wings will I rejoice.\
9 My soul hangeth upon thee; \* thy right hand hath upholden me.\
10 These also that seek the hurt of my soul, \* they shall go under the
earth.\
11 Let them fall upon the edge of the sword, \* that they may be a
portion for foxes.\
12 But the King shall rejoice in God; all they also that swear by him
shall be commended; \* for the mouth of them that speak lies shall be
stopped.\
\
**\
Psalm 64. Exaudi, Deus.**\
HEAR my voice, O God, in my prayer; \* preserve my life from fear of the
enemy.\
2 Hide me from the gathering together of the froward, \* and from the
insurrection of wicked doers;\
3 Who have whet their tongue like a sword, \* and shoot out their
arrows, even bitter words;\
4 That they may privily shoot at him that is perfect: \* suddenly do
they hit him, and fear not.\
5 They encourage themselves in mischief, \* and commune among
themselves, how they may lay snares; and say, that no man shall see
them.\
6 They imagine wickedness, and practise it; \* that they keep secret
among themselves, every man in the deep of his heart.\
7 But God shall suddenly shoot at them with a swift arrow, \* that they
shall be wounded.\
8 Yea, their own tongues shall make them fall; \* insomuch that whoso
seeth them shall laugh them to scorn.\
9 And all men that see it shall say, This hath God done; \* for they
shall perceive that it is his work.\
10 The righteous shall rejoice in the LORD, and put his trust in him; \*
and all they that are true of heart shall be glad.\

Evening Prayer.

**Psalm 65. Te decet hymnus.**\
THOU, O God, art praised in Sion; \* and unto thee shall the vow be
performed in Jerusalem.\
2 Thou that hearest the prayer, \* unto thee shall all flesh come.\
3 My misdeeds prevail against me: \* O be thou merciful unto our sins.\
4 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and receivest unto thee: \* he
shall dwell in thy court, and shall be satisfied with the pleasures of
thy house, even of thy holy temple.\
5 Thou shalt show us wonderful things in thy righteousness, O God of our
salvation; \* thou that art the hope of all the ends of the earth, and
of them that remain in the broad sea.\
6 Who in his strength setteth fast the mountains, \* and is girded about
with power.\
7 Who stilleth the raging of the sea, \* and the noise of his waves, and
the madness of the peoples.\
8 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts of the earth shall be
afraid at thy tokens, \* thou that makest the out-goings of the morning
and evening to praise thee.\
9 Thou visitest the earth, and blessest it; \* thou makest it very
plenteous.\
10 The river of God is full of water: \* thou preparest their corn, for
so thou providest for the earth.\
11 Thou waterest her furrows; thou sendest rain into the little valleys
thereof; \* thou makest it soft with the drops of rain, and blessest the
increase of it.\
12 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; \* and thy clouds drop
fatness.\
13 They shall drop upon the dwellings of the wilderness; \* and the
little hills shall rejoice on every side.\
14 The folds shall be full of sheep; \* the valleys also shall stand so
thick with corn, that they shall laugh and sing.\
\
**\
Psalm 66. Jubilate Deo.**\
O BE joyful in God, all ye lands; \* sing praises unto the honour of his
Name; make his praise to be glorious.\
2 Say unto God, O how wonderful art thou in thy works! \* through the
greatness of thy power shall thine enemies bow down unto thee.\
3 For all the world shall worship thee, \* sing of thee, and praise thy
Name.\
4 O come hither, and behold the works of God; \* how wonderful he is in
his doing toward the children of men.\
5 He turned the sea into dry land, \* so that they went through the
water on foot; there did we rejoice thereof.\
6 He ruleth with his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: \* and
such as will not believe shall not be able to exalt themselves.\
7 O praise our God, ye peoples, \* and make the voice of his praise to
be heard;\
8 Who holdeth our soul in life; \* and suffereth not our feet to slip.\
9 For thou, O God, hast proved us; \* thou also hast tried us, like as
silver is tried.\
10 Thou broughtest us into the snare; \* and laidest trouble upon our
loins.\
11 Thou sufferedst men to ride over our heads; \* we went through fire
and water, and thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.\
12 I will go into thine house with burnt-offerings, and will pay thee my
vows, \* which I promised with my lips, and spake with my mouth, when I
was in trouble.\
13 I will offer unto thee fat burnt-sacrifices, with the incense of
rams; \* I will offer bullocks and goats.\
14 O come hither, and hearken, all ye that fear God; \* and I will tell
you what he hath done for my soul.\
15 I called unto him with my mouth, \* and gave him praises with my
tongue.\
16 If I incline unto wickedness with mine heart, \* the Lord will not
hear me.\
17 But God hath heard me; \* and considered the voice of my prayer.\
18 Praised be God, who hath not cast out my prayer, \* nor turned his
mercy from me.\
\
**\
Psalm 67. Deus misereatur.**\
GOD be merciful unto us, and bless us, \* and show us the light of his
countenance, and be merciful unto us;\
2 That thy way may be known upon earth, \* thy saving health among all
nations.\
3 Let the peoples praise thee, O God; \* yea, let all the peoples praise
thee.\
4 O let the nations rejoice and be glad; \* for thou shalt judge the
folk righteously, and govern the nations upon earth.\
5 Let the peoples praise thee, O God; \* yea, let all the peoples praise
thee.\
6 Then shall the earth bring forth her increase; \* and God, even our
own God, shall give us his blessing.\
7 God shall bless us; \* and all the ends of the world shall fear him.\

The Thirteenth Day.\
\
Morning Prayer.

**Psalm 68. Exsurgat Deus.**\
LET God arise, and let his enemies be scattered; \* let them also that
hate him flee before him.\
2 Like as the smoke vanisheth, so shalt thou drive them away; \* and
like as wax melteth at the fire, so let the ungodly perish at the
presence of God.\
3 But let the righteous be glad, and rejoice before God; \* let them
also be merry and joyful.\
4 O sing unto God, and sing praises unto his Name; magnify him that
rideth upon the heavens; \* praise him in his Name JAH, and rejoice
before him.\
5 He is a Father of the fatherless, and defendeth the cause of the
widows; \* even God in his holy habitation.\
6 He is the God that maketh men to be of one mind in an house, and
bringeth the prisoners out of captivity; \* but letteth the runagates
continue in scarceness.\
7 O God, when thou wentest forth before the people; \* when thou wentest
through the wilderness,\
8 The earth shook, and the heavens dropped at the presence of God; \*
even as Sinai also was moved at the presence of God, who is the God of
Israel.\
9 Thou, O God, sentest a gracious rain upon thine inheritance, \* and
refreshedst it when it was weary.\
10 Thy congregation shall dwell therein; \* for thou, O God, hast of thy
goodness prepared for the poor.\
11 The Lord gave the word; \* great was the company of women that bare
the tidings.\
12 Kings with their armies did flee, and were discomfited, \* and they
of the household divided the spoil.\
13 Though ye have lain among the sheep-folds, yet shall ye be as the
wings of a dove \* that is covered with silver wings, and her feathers
like gold.\
14 When the Almighty scattered kings for their sake, \* then were they
as white as snow in Salmon.\
15 As the hill of Bashan, so is God\'s hill; \* even an high hill, as
the hill of Bashan.\
16 Why mock ye so, ye high hills? this is God\'s hill, in the which it
pleaseth him to dwell; \* yea, the LORD will abide in it for ever.\
17 The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels; \*
and the Lord is among them as in the holy place of Sinai.\
18 Thou art gone up on high, thou hast led captivity captive, and
received gifts from men; \* yea, even from thine enemies, that the LORD
God might dwell among them.\
19 Praised be the Lord daily, \* even the God who helpeth us, and
poureth his benefits upon us.\
20 He is our God, even the God of whom cometh salvation: \* GOD is the
Lord, by whom we escape death.\
21 God shall wound the head of his enemies, \* and the hairy scalp of
such a one as goeth on still in his wickedness.\
22 The Lord hath said, I will bring my people again, as I did from
Bashan; \* mine own will I bring again, as I did sometime from the deep
of the sea.\
23 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, \* and
that the tongue of thy dogs may be red through the same.\
24 It is well seen, O God, how thou goest; \* how thou, my God and King,
goest in the sanctuary.\
25 The singers go before, the minstrels follow after, \* in the midst of
the damsels playing with the timbrels.\
26 Give thanks unto God the Lord in the congregation, \* ye that are of
the fountain of Israel.\
27 There is little Benjamin their ruler, and the princes of Judah their
council; \* the princes of Zebulon, and the princes of Naphthali.\
28 Thy God hath sent forth strength for thee; \* stablish the thing, O
God, that thou hast wrought in us,\
29 For thy temple\'s sake at Jerusalem; \* so shall kings bring presents
unto thee.\
30 Rebuke thou the dragon and the bull, with the leaders of the heathen,
so that they humbly bring pieces of silver; \* scatter thou the peoples
that delight in war;\
31 Then shall the princes come out of Egypt; \* the Morians\' land shall
soon stretch out her hands unto God.\
32 Sing unto God, O ye kingdoms of the earth; \* O sing praises unto the
Lord;\
33 Who sitteth in the heavens over all, from the beginning: \* lo, he
doth send out his voice; yea, and that a mighty voice.\
34 Ascribe ye the power to God over Israel; \* his worship and strength
is in the clouds.\
35 O God, wonderful art thou in thy holy places: \* even the God of
Israel, he will give strength and power unto his people. Blessed be
God.\

Evening Prayer.

**Psalm 69. Salvum me fac.**\
SAVE me, O God; \* for the waters are come in, even unto my soul.\
2 I stick fast in the deep mire, where no ground is; \* I am come into
deep waters, so that the floods run over me.\
3 I am weary of crying; my throat is dry; \* my sight faileth me for
waiting so long upon my God.\
4 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head;
\* they that are mine enemies, and would destroy me guiltless, are
mighty.\
5 I paid them the things that I never took: \* God, thou knowest my
simpleness, and my faults are not hid from thee.\
6 Let not them that trust in thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for
my cause; \* let not those that seek thee be confounded through me, O
Lord God of Israel.\
7 And why? for thy sake have I suffered reproof; \* shame hath covered
my face.\
8 I am become a stranger unto my brethren, \* even an alien unto my
mother\'s children.\
9 For the zeal of thine house hath even eaten me; \* and the rebukes of
them that rebuked thee are fallen upon me.\
10 I wept, and chastened myself with fasting, \* and that was turned to
my reproof.\
11 I put on sackcloth also, \* and they jested upon me.\
12 They that sit in the gate speak against me, \* and the drunkards make
songs upon me.\
13 But, LORD, I make my prayer unto thee \* in an acceptable time.\
14 Hear me, O God, in the multitude of thy mercy, \* even in the truth
of thy salvation.\
15 Take me out of the mire, that I sink not; \* O let me be delivered
from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.\
16 Let not the water-flood drown me, neither let the deep swallow me up;
\* and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.\
17 Hear me, O LORD, for thy loving-kindness is comfortable; \* turn thee
unto me according to the multitude of thy mercies.\
18 And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: \* O
haste thee, and hear me.\
19 Draw nigh unto my soul, and save it; \* O deliver me, because of mine
enemies.\
20 Thou hast known my reproach, my shame, and my dishonour: \* mine
adversaries are all in thy sight.\
21 Reproach hath broken my heart; I am full of heaviness: \* I looked
for some to have pity on me, but there was no man, neither found I any
to comfort me.\
22 They gave me gall to eat; \* and when I was thirsty they gave me
vinegar to drink.\
23 Let their table be made a snare to take themselves withal; \* and let
the things that should have been for their wealth be unto them an
occasion of falling.\
24 Let their eyes be blinded, that they see not; \* and ever bow thou
down their backs.\
25 Pour out thine indignation upon them, \* and let thy wrathful
displeasure take hold of them.\
26 Let their habitation be void, \* and no man to dwell in their tents.\
27 For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; \* and they talk how
they may vex them whom thou hast wounded.\
28 Let them fall from one wickedness to another, \* and not come into
thy righteousness.\
29 Let them be wiped out of the book of the living, \* and not be
written among the righteous.\
30 As for me, when I am poor and in heaviness, \* thy help, O God, shall
lift me up.\
31 I will praise the Name of God with a song, \* and magnify it with
thanksgiving.\
32 This also shall please the LORD \* better than a bullock that hath
horns and hoofs.\
33 The humble shall consider this, and be glad: \* seek ye after God,
and your soul shall live.\
34 For the LORD heareth the poor, \* and despiseth not his prisoners.\
35 Let heaven and earth praise him: \* the sea, and all that moveth
therein.\
36 For God will save Sion, and build the cities of Judah, \* that men
may dwell there, and have it in possession.\
37 The posterity also of his servants shall inherit it; \* and they that
love his Name shall dwell therein.\
\
**\
Psalm 70. Deus, in adjutorium.**\
HASTE thee, O God, to deliver me; \* make haste to help me, O LORD.\
2 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul; \* let
them be turned backward and put to confusion that wish me evil.\
3 Let them for their reward be soon brought to shame, \* that cry over
me, There! there!\
4 But let all those that seek thee be joyful and glad in thee: \* and
let all such as delight in thy salvation say alway, The Lord be
praised.\
5 As for me, I am poor and in misery: \* haste thee unto me, O God.\
6 Thou art my helper, and my redeemer: \* O LORD, make no long
tarrying.\

The Fourteenth Day.\
\
Morning Prayer.

**Psalm 71. In te, Domine, speravi.**\
IN thee, O LORD, have I put my trust; let me never be put to confusion,
\* but rid me and deliver me in thy righteousness; incline thine ear
unto me, and save me.\
2 Be thou my stronghold, whereunto I may alway resort: \* thou hast
promised to help me, for thou art my house of defence, and my castle.\
3 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the ungodly, \* out of the
hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.\
4 For thou, O Lord GOD, art the thing that I long for: \* thou art my
hope, even from my youth.\
5 Through thee have I been holden up ever since I was born: \* thou art
he that took me out of my mother\'s womb: my praise shall be alway of
thee.\
6 I am become as it were a monster unto many, \* but my sure trust is in
thee.\
7 O let my mouth be filled with thy praise, \* that I may sing of thy
glory and honour all the day long.\
8 Cast me not away in the time of age; \* forsake me not when my
strength faileth me.\
9 For mine enemies speak against me; \* and they that lay wait for my
soul take their counsel together, saying,\
10 God hath forsaken him; \* persecute him, and take him, for there is
none to deliver him.\
11 Go not far from me, O God; \* my God, haste thee to help me.\
12 Let them be confounded and perish that are against my soul; \* let
them be covered with shame and dishonour that seek to do me evil.\
13 As for me, I will patiently abide alway, \* and will praise thee more
and more.\
14 My mouth shall daily speak of thy righteousness and salvation; \* for
I know no end thereof.\
15 I will go forth in the strength of the Lord GOD, \* and will make
mention of thy righteousness only.\
16 Thou, O God, hast taught me from my youth up until now; \* therefore
will I tell of thy wondrous works.\
17 Forsake me not, O God, in mine old age, when I am gray-headed, \*
until I have showed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to
all them that are yet for to come.\
18 Thy righteousness, O God, is very high, \* and great things are they
that thou hast done: O God, who is like unto thee!\
19 O what great troubles and adversities hast thou showed me ! and yet
didst thou turn and refresh me; \* yea, and broughtest me from the deep
of the earth again.\
20 Thou hast brought me to great honour, \* and comforted me on every
side:\
21 Therefore will I praise thee, and thy faithfulness, O God, playing
upon an instrument of music: \* unto thee will I sing upon the harp, O
thou Holy One of Israel.\
22 My lips will be glad when I sing unto thee; \* and so will my soul
whom thou hast delivered.\
23 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long; \*
for they are confounded and brought unto shame that seek to do me evil.\
\
**\
Psalm 72. Deus, judicium.**\
GIVE the King thy judgments, O God, \* and thy righteousness unto the
King\'s son.\
2 Then shall he judge thy people according unto right, \* and defend the
poor.\
3 The mountains also shall bring peace, \* and the little hills
righteousness unto the people.\
4 He shall keep the simple folk by their right, \* defend the children
of the poor, and punish the wrong doer.\
5 They shall fear thee, as long as the sun and moon endureth, \* from
one generation to another.\
6 He shall come down like the rain upon the mown grass, \* even as the
drops that water the earth.\
7 In his time shall the righteous flourish; \* yea, and abundance of
peace, so long as the moon endureth.\
8 His dominion shall be also from the one sea to the other, \* and from
the River unto the world\'s end.\
9 They that dwell in the wilderness shall kneel before him; \* his
enemies shall lick the dust.\
10 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall give presents; \* the
kings of Arabia and Saba shall bring gifts.\
11 All kings shall fall down before him; \* all nations shall do him
service.\
12 For he shall deliver the poor when he crieth; \* the needy also, and
him that hath no helper.\
13 He shall be favourable to the simple and needy, \* and shall preserve
the souls of the poor.\
14 He shall deliver their souls from falsehood and wrong; \* and dear
shall their blood be in his sight.\
15 He shall live, and unto him shall be given of the gold of Arabia; \*
prayer shall be made ever unto him, and daily shall he be praised.\
16 There shall be an heap of corn in the earth, high upon the hills ;
the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: \* and they of the city
shall flourish like grass upon the earth.\
17 His Name shall endure for ever; his Name shall remain under the sun
among the posterities, which shall be blessed in him; \* and all the
nations shall praise him.\
18 Blessed be the LORD God, even the God of Israel, \* which only doeth
wondrous things;\
19 And blessed be the Name of his majesty for ever: \* and all the earth
shall be filled with his majesty. Amen, Amen.
