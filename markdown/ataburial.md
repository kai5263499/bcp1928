| O ETERNAL Lord God, who holdest all souls in life; Vouchsafe, we      |
| beseech thee, to thy whole Church in paradise and on earth, thy light |
| and thy peace; and grant that we, following the good examples of      |
| those who have served thee here and are now at rest, may at the last  |
| enter with them into thine unending joy; through Jesus Christ our     |
| Lord. Amen.                                                           |

| O GOD, whose mercies cannot be numbered; Accept our prayers on behalf |
| of the soul of thy servant departed, and grant him an entrance into   |
| the land of light and joy, in the fellowship of thy saints; through   |

| I WOULD not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which  |
| are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.    |
| For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also   |
| which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. For this we say unto    |
| you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto  |
| the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For   |
| the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the     |
| voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in    |
| Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be  |
| caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the   |
| air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one     |
| another with these words.\                                            |

| JESUS said unto them, All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; |
| and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. For I came down |
| from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent   |
| me. And this is the Father\'s will which hath sent me, that of all    |
| which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up  |
| again at the last day. And this is the will of him that sent me, that |
| every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have         |
| everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.            |
