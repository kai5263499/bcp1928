| O ETERNAL God, through whose mighty power our fathers won their       |
| liberties of old; Grant, we beseech thee, that we and all the people  |
| of this land may have grace to maintain these liberties in            |
| righteousness and peace; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\        |
|                                                                       |
| For the Epistle. Deuteronomy x. 17.                                   |
|                                                                       |
| THE LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a   |
| mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh       |
| reward: he doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and |
| loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment. Love ye          |
| therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.   |
| Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him    |
| shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name. He is thy praise, and he is |
| thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things,     |
| which thine eyes have seen.\                                          |
|                                                                       |
| The Gospel. St. Matthew v. 43.                                        |
|                                                                       |
| JESUS said, Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy |
| neighbour, and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you, Love your        |
| enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you,    |
| and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; that |
| ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he      |
| maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain  |
| on the just and on the unjust. For if ye love them which love you,    |
| what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same? And if ye    |
| salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even   |
| the publicans so? Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which  |
| is in heaven is perfect.                                              |
