**Psalm 147. Laudate Dominum.**\
PRAISE the LORD, for it is a good thing to sing praises unto our God; \*
yea, a joyful and pleasant thing it is to be thankful.\
2 The LORD doth build up Jerusalem, \* and gather together the outcasts
of Israel.\
3 He healeth those that are broken in heart, \* and giveth medicine to
heal their sickness.\
4 He telleth the number of the stars, \* and calleth them all by their
names.\
5 Great is our Lord, and great is his power; \* yea, and his wisdom is
infinite.\
6 The LORD setteth up the meek, \* and bringeth the ungodly down to the
ground.\
7 O sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; \* sing praises upon the harp
unto our God:\
8 Who covereth the heaven with clouds, and prepareth rain for the earth;
\* and maketh the grass to grow upon the mountains, and herb for the use
of men;\
9 Who giveth fodder unto the cattle, \* and feedeth the young ravens
that call upon him.\
10 He hath no pleasure in the strength of an horse; \* neither
delighteth he in any man\'s legs.\
11 But the LORD\'S delight is in them that fear him, \* and put their
trust in his mercy. \~\
12 Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; \* praise thy God, O Sion.\
13 For he hath made fast the bars of thy gates, \* and hath blessed thy
children within thee.\
14 He maketh peace in thy borders, \* and filleth thee with the flour of
wheat.\
15 He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth, \* and his word runneth
very swiftly.\
16 He giveth snow like wool, \* and scattereth the hoarfrost like
ashes.\
17 He casteth forth his ice like morsels: \* who is able to abide his
frost?\
18 He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: \* he bloweth with his
wind, and the waters flow.\
19 He showeth his word unto Jacob, \* his statutes and ordinances unto
Israel.\
20 He hath not dealt so with any nation; \* neither have the heathen
knowledge of his laws.\

**Psalm 148. Laudate Dominum.**\
O PRAISE the LORD from the heavens: \* praise him in the heights.\
2 Praise him, all ye angels of his: \* praise him, all his host.\
3 Praise him, sun and moon: \* praise him, all ye stars and light.\
4 Praise him, all ye heavens, \* and ye waters that are above the
heavens.\
5 Let them praise the Name of the LORD: \* for he spake the word, and
they were made; he commanded, and they were created.\
6 He hath made them fast for ever and ever: \* he hath given them a law
which shall not be broken.\
7 Praise the LORD from the earth, \* ye dragons and all deeps;\
8 Fire and hail, snow and vapours, \* wind and storm, fulfilling his
word;\
9 Mountains and all hills; \* fruitful trees and all cedars;\
10 Beasts and all cattle; \* creeping things and flying fowls;\
11 Kings of the earth, and all peoples; \* princes, and all judges of
the world;\
12 Young men and maidens, old men and children, praise the Name of the
LORD: \* for his Name only is excellent, and his praise above heaven and
earth.\
13 He shall exalt the horn of his people: all his saints shall praise
him; \* even the children of Israel, even the people that serveth him.\

**Psalm 149. Cantate Domino.**\
O SING unto the LORD a new song; \* let the congregation of saints
praise him.\
2 Let Israel rejoice in him that made him, \* and let the children of
Sion be joyful in their King.\
3 Let them praise his Name in the dance: \* let them sing praises unto
him with tabret and harp.\
4 For the LORD hath pleasure in his people, \* and helpeth the
meek-hearted.\
5 Let the saints be joyful with glory; \* let them rejoice in their
beds.\
6 Let the praises of God be in their mouth; \* and a two-edged sword in
their hands;\
7 To be avenged of the nations, \* and to rebuke the peoples;\
8 To bind their kings in chains, \* and their nobles with links of
iron;\
9 To execute judgment upon them; as it is written, \* Such honour have
all his saints.\

**Psalm 150. Laudate Dominum.**\
O PRAISE God in his sanctuary: \* praise him in the firmament of his
power.\
2 Praise him in his noble acts: \* praise him according to his excellent
greatness.\
3 Praise him in the sound of the trumpet: \* praise him upon the lute
and harp.\
4 Praise him in the timbrels and dances: \* praise him upon the strings
and pipe.\
5 Praise him upon the well-tuned cymbals: \* praise him upon the loud
cymbals.\
6 Let every thing that hath breath \* praise the LORD.
