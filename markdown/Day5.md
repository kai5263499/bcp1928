| Psalm 25. Ad te, Domine, levavi.**\                                   |
| UNTO thee, O LORD, will I lift up my soul; my God, I have put my      |
| trust in thee: \* O let me not be confounded, neither let mine        |
| enemies triumph over me.\                                             |
| 2 For all they that hope in thee shall not be ashamed; \* but such as |
| transgress without a cause shall be put to confusion.\                |
| 3 Show me thy ways, O LORD, \* and teach me thy paths.\               |
| 4 Lead me forth in thy truth, and learn me: \* for thou art the God   |
| of my salvation; in thee hath been my hope all the day long.\         |
| 5 Call to remembrance, O LORD, thy tender mercies, \* and thy         |
| loving-kindnesses, which have been ever of old.\                      |
| 6 O remember not the sins and offences of my youth; \* but according  |
| to thy mercy think thou upon me, O LORD, for thy goodness.\           |
| 7 Gracious and righteous is the LORD; \* therefore, will he teach     |

| gentle, them shall he learn his way.\                                 |
| 9 All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth, \* unto such as keep |
| his covenant and his testimonies.\                                    |
| 10 For thy Name\'s sake, O LORD, \* be merciful unto my sin; for it   |
| is great.\                                                            |
| 11 What man is he that feareth the LORD? \* him shall he teach in the |
| way that he shall choose.\                                            |
| 12 His soul shall dwell at ease, \* and his seed shall inherit the    |

| show them his covenant.\                                              |
| 14 Mine eyes are ever looking unto the LORD; \* for he shall pluck my |
| feet out of the net.\                                                 |
| 15 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; \* for I am desolate,   |
| and in misery.\                                                       |
| 16 The sorrows of my heart are enlarged: \* O bring thou me out of my |
| troubles.\                                                            |
| 17 Look upon my adversity and misery, \* and forgive me all my sin.\  |
| 18 Consider mine enemies, how many they are; \* and they bear a       |
| tyrannous hate against me.\                                           |
| 19 O keep my soul, and deliver me: \* let me not be confounded, for I |
| have put my trust in thee.\                                           |
| 20 Let perfectness and righteous dealing wait upon me; \* for my hope |
| hath been in thee.\                                                   |

| Psalm 26. Judica me, Domine.**\                                       |
| BE thou my Judge, O LORD, for I have walked innocently: \* my trust   |
| hath been also in the LORD, therefore shall I not fall.\              |
| 2 Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; \* try out my reins and my        |
| heart.\                                                               |
| 3 For thy loving-kindness is ever before mine eyes; \* and I will     |
| walk in thy truth.\                                                   |
| 4 I have not dwelt with vain persons; \* neither will I have          |
| fellowship with the deceitful.\                                       |
| 5 I have hated the congregation of the wicked; \* and will not sit    |
| among the ungodly.\                                                   |
| 6 I will wash my hands in innocency, O LORD; \* and so will I go to   |
| thine altar;\                                                         |
| 7 That I may show the voice of thanksgiving, \* and tell of all thy   |
| wondrous works.\                                                      |

| where thine honour dwelleth.\                                         |
| 9 O shut not up my soul with the sinners, \* nor my life with the     |

| merciful unto me.\                                                    |

| **Psalm 27. Dominus illuminatio.**\                                   |
| THE LORD is my light and my salvation; whom then shall I fear? \* the |
| LORD is the strength of my life; of whom then shall I be afraid?\     |
| 2 When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat |
| up my flesh, \* they stumbled and fell.\                              |
| 3 Though an host of men were laid against me, yet shall not my heart  |
| be afraid; \* and though there rose up war against me, yet will I put |
| my trust in him.\                                                     |
| 4 One thing have I desired of the LORD, which I will require; \* even |
| that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to |
| behold the fair beauty of the LORD, and to visit his temple.\         |
| 5 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his tabernacle; \*   |
| yea, in the secret place of his dwelling shall he hide me, and set me |
| up upon a rock of stone.\                                             |
| 6 And now shall he lift up mine head \* above mine enemies round      |
| about me.\                                                            |
| 7 Therefore will I offer in his dwelling an oblation, with great      |
| gladness: \* I will sing and speak praises unto the LORD.\            |
| 8 Hearken unto my voice, O LORD, when I cry unto thee; \* have mercy  |
| upon me, and hear me.\                                                |
| 9 My heart hath talked of thee, Seek ye my face: \* Thy face, LORD,   |
| will I seek.\                                                         |
| 10 O hide not thou thy face from me, \* nor cast thy servant away in  |
| displeasure.\                                                         |
| 11 Thou hast been my succour; \* leave me not, neither forsake me, O  |
| God of my salvation.\                                                 |
| 12 When my father and my mother forsake me, \* the LORD taketh me     |
| up.\                                                                  |
| 13 Teach me thy way, O LORD, \* and lead me in the right way, because |
| of mine enemies.\                                                     |
| 14 Deliver me not over into the will of mine adversaries: \* for      |
| there are false witnesses risen up against me, and such as speak      |
| wrong.\                                                               |
| 15 I should utterly have fainted, \* but that I believe verily to see |
| the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.\                  |
| 16 O tarry thou the LORD\'S leisure; \* be strong, and he shall       |
| comfort thine heart; and put thou thy trust in the LORD.\             |
| **\                                                                   |
| \                                                                     |
| Psalm 28. Ad te, Domine.**\                                           |
| UNTO thee will I cry, O LORD, my strength: \* think no scorn of me;   |
| lest, if thou make as though thou hearest not, I become like them     |
| that go down into the pit.\                                           |
| 2 Hear the voice of my humble petitions, when I cry unto thee; \*     |
| when I hold up my hands towards the mercyseat of thy holy temple.\    |
| 3 O pluck me not away, neither destroy me with the ungodly and wicked |
| doers, \* which speak friendly to their neighbours, but imagine       |
| mischief in their hearts.\                                            |
| 4 Reward them according to their deeds, \* and according to the       |
| wickedness of their own inventions.\                                  |
| 5 Recompense them after the work of their hands; \* pay them that     |
| they have deserved.\                                                  |
| 6 For they regard not in their mind the works of the LORD, nor the    |
| operation of his hands; \* therefore shall he break them down, and    |
| not build them up.\                                                   |
| 7 Praised be the LORD; \* for he hath heard the voice of my humble    |
| petitions.\                                                           |
| 8 The LORD is my strength, and my shield; my heart hath trusted in    |
| him, and I am helped; \* therefore my heart danceth for joy, and in   |
| my song will I praise him.\                                           |
| 9 The LORD is my strength, \* and he is the wholesome defence of his  |
| anointed.\                                                            |
| 10 O save thy people, and give thy blessing unto thine inheritance:   |
| \* feed them, and set them up for ever.\                              |
| \                                                                     |

| Psalm 29. Afferte Domino.**\                                          |
| A SCRIBE unto the LORD, O ye mighty, \* ascribe unto the LORD worship |
| and strength.\                                                        |
| 2 Ascribe unto the LORD the honour due unto his Name; \* worship the  |
| LORD with holy worship.\                                              |
| 3 The voice of the LORD is upon the waters; \* it is the glorious God |
| that maketh the thunder.\                                             |
| 4 It is the LORD that ruleth the sea; the voice of the LORD is mighty |
| in operation; \* the voice of the LORD is a glorious voice.\          |
| 5 The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedar-trees; \* yea, the LORD    |
| breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.\                                      |
| 6 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; \* Lebanon also, and       |
| Sirion, like a young unicorn.\                                        |
| 7 The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire; the voice of the |
| LORD shaketh the wilderness; \* yea, the LORD shaketh the wilderness  |
| of Kadesh.\                                                           |
| 8 The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to bring forth young, and    |
| strippeth bare the forests: \* in his temple doth every thing speak   |
| of his honour.\                                                       |
| 9 The LORD sitteth above the water-flood, \* and the LORD remaineth a |
| King for ever.\                                                       |
| 10 The LORD shall give strength unto his people; \* the LORD shall    |
| give his people the blessing of peace.                                |
|                                                                       |
