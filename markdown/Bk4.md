\
Morning Prayer.

**Psalm 90. Domine, refugium.**\
LORD, thou hast been our refuge, \* from one generation to another.\
2 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and the
world were made, \* thou art God from everlasting, and world without
end.\
3 Thou turnest man to destruction; \* again thou sayest, Come again, ye
children of men.\
4 For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is
past, \* and as a watch in the night.\
5 As soon as thou scatterest them they are even as a sleep; \* and fade
away suddenly like the grass.\
6 In the morning it is green, and groweth up; \* but in the evening it
is cut down, dried up, and withered.\
7 For we consume away in thy displeasure, \* and are afraid at thy
wrathful indignation.\
8 Thou hast set our misdeeds before thee; \* and our secret sins in the
light of thy countenance.\
9 For when thou art angry all our days are gone: \* we bring our years
to an end, as it were a tale that is told.\
10 The days of our age are threescore years and ten; and though men be
so strong that they come to fourscore years, \* yet is their strength
then but labour and sorrow; so soon passeth it away, and we are gone.\
11 But who regardeth the power of thy wrath? \* or feareth aright thy
indignation?\
12 So teach us to number our days, \* that we may apply our hearts unto
wisdom.\
13 Turn thee again, O LORD, at the last, \* and be gracious unto thy
servants.\
14 O satisfy us with thy mercy, and that soon: \* so shall we rejoice
and be glad all the days of our life.\
15 Comfort us again now after the time that thou hast plagued us; \* and
for the years wherein we have suffered adversity.\
16 Show thy servants thy work, \* and their children thy glory.\
17 And the glorious majesty of the LORD our God be upon us: \* prosper
thou the work of our hands upon us; O prosper thou our handy-work.\
\
**\
Psalm 91. Qui habitat.**\
WHOSO dwelleth under the defence of the Most High, \* shall abide under
the shadow of the Almighty.\
2 I will say unto the LORD, Thou art my hope, and my stronghold; \* my
God, in him will I trust.\
3 For he shall deliver thee from the snare of the hunter, \* and from
the noisome pestilence.\
4 He shall defend thee under his wings, and thou shalt be safe under his
feathers; \* his faithfulness and truth shall be thy shield and
buckler.\
5 Thou shalt not be afraid for any terror by night, \* nor for the arrow
that flieth by day;\
6 For the pestilence that walketh in darkness, \* nor for the sickness
that destroyeth in the noon-day.\
7 A thousand shall fall beside thee, and ten thousand at thy right hand;
\* but it shall not come nigh thee.\
8 Yea, with thine eyes shalt thou behold, \* and see the reward of the
ungodly.\
9 For thou, LORD, art my hope; \* thou hast set thine house of defence
very high.\
10 There shall no evil happen unto thee, \* neither shall any plague
come nigh thy dwelling.\
11 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, \* to keep thee in all
thy ways.\
12 They shall bear thee in their hands, \* that thou hurt not thy foot
against a stone.\
13 Thou shalt go upon the lion and adder: \* the young lion and the
dragon shalt thou tread under thy feet.\
14 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him;
\* I will set him up, because he hath known my Name.\
15 He shall call upon me, and I will hear him; \* yea, I am with him in
trouble; I will deliver him, and bring him to honour.\
16 With long life will I satisfy him, \* and show him my salvation.\
\
**\
Psalm 92. Bonum est confiteri.**\
IT is a good thing to give thanks unto the LORD, \* and to sing praises
unto thy Name, O Most Highest;\
2 To tell of thy loving-kindness early in the morning, \* and of thy
truth in the night season;\
3 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the lute; \* upon a loud
instrument, and upon the harp.\
4 For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy works; \* and I will
rejoice in giving praise for the operations of thy hands.\
5 O LORD, how glorious are thy works! \* thy thoughts are very deep.\
6 An unwise man doth not well consider this, \* and a fool doth not
understand it.\
7 When the ungodly are green as the grass, and when all the workers of
wickedness do flourish, \* then shall they be destroyed for ever; but
thou, LORD, art the Most Highest for evermore.\
8 For lo, thine enemies, O LORD, lo, thine enemies shall perish; \* and
all the workers of wickedness shall be destroyed.\
9 But my horn shall be exalted like the horn of an unicorn; \* for I am
anointed with fresh oil.\
10 Mine eye also shall see his lust of mine enemies, \* and mine ear
shall hear his desire of the wicked that arise up against me.\
11 The righteous shall flourish like a palm-tree, \* and shall spread
abroad like a cedar in Lebanon.\
12 Such as are planted in the house of the LORD, \* shall flourish in
the courts of the house of our God.\
13 They also shall bring forth more fruit in their age, \* and shall be
fat and well-liking;\
14 That they may show how true the LORD my strength is, \* and that
there is no unrighteousness in him.\

Evening Prayer.

**Psalm 93. Dominus regnavit.**\
THE LORD is King, and hath put on glorious apparel; \* the LORD hath put
on his apparel, and girded himself with strength.\
2 He hath made the round world so sure, \* that it cannot be moved.\
3 Ever since the world began, hath thy seat been prepared: \* thou art
from everlasting.\
4 The floods are risen, O LORD, the floods have lift up their voice; \*
the floods lift up their waves.\
5 The waves of the sea are mighty, and rage horribly; \* but yet the
LORD, who dwelleth on high, is mightier.\
6 Thy testimonies, O LORD, are very sure: \* holiness becometh thine
house for ever.\
\
**\
Psalm 94. Deus ultionum.**\
O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth, \* thou God, to whom vengeance
belongeth, show thyself.\
2 Arise, thou Judge of the world, \* and reward the proud after their
deserving.\
3 LORD, how long shall the ungodly, \* how long shall the ungodly
triumph?\
4 How long shall all wicked doers speak so disdainfully, \* and make
such proud boasting?\
5 They smite down thy people, O LORD, \* and trouble thine heritage.\
6 They murder the widow and the stranger, \* and put the fatherless to
death.\
7 And yet they say, Tush, the LORD shall not see, \* neither shall the
God of Jacob regard it.\
8 Take heed, ye unwise among the people: \* O ye fools, when will ye
understand?\
9 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? \* or he that made the
eye, shall he not see?\
10 Or he that instructeth the heathen, \* it is he that teacheth man
knowledge; shall not he punish?\
11 The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, \* that they are but vain.\
12 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, \* and teachest him
in thy law;\
13 That thou mayest give him patience in time of adversity, \* until the
pit be digged up for the ungodly.\
14 For the LORD will not fail his people; \* neither will he forsake his
inheritance;\
15 Until righteousness turn again unto judgment: \* all such as are true
in heart shall follow it.\
16 Who will rise up with me against the wicked? \* or who will take my
part against the evil doers?\
17 If the LORD had not helped me, \* it had not failed, but my soul had
been put to silence.\
18 But when I said, My foot hath slipt; \* thy mercy, O LORD, held me
up.\
19 In the multitude of the sorrows that I had in my heart, \* thy
comforts have refreshed my soul.\
20 Wilt thou have any thing to do with the throne of wickedness, \*
which imagineth mischief as a law?\
21 They gather them together against the soul of the righteous, \* and
condemn the innocent blood.\
22 But the LORD is my refuge, \* and my God is the strength of my
confidence.\
23 He shall recompense them their wickedness, and destroy them in their
own malice; \* yea, the LORD our God shall destroy them.\

The Nineteenth Day.\
\
Morning Prayer.

**Psalm 95. Venite, exultemus.**\
O COME, let us sing unto the LORD; \* let us heartily rejoice in the
strength of our salvation.\
2 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving; \* and show
ourselves glad in him with psalms.\
3 For the LORD is a great God; \* and a great King above all gods.\
4 In his hand are all the corners of the earth; \* and the strength of
the hills is his also.\
5 The sea is his, and he made it; \* and his hands prepared the dry
land.\
6 O come, let us worship and fall down, \* and kneel before the LORD our
Maker.\
7 For he is the Lord our God; \* and we are the people of his pasture,
and the sheep of his hand.\
8 To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts \* as in the
provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness;\
9 When your fathers tempted me, \* proved me, and saw my works.\
10 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, \* It
is a people that do err in their hearts, for they have not known my
ways:\
11 Unto whom I sware in my wrath, \* that they should not enter into my
rest.\
\
**\
Psalm 96. Cantate Domino.**\
O SING unto the LORD a new song; \* sing unto the LORD, all the whole
earth.\
2 Sing unto the LORD, and praise his Name; \* be telling of his
salvation from day to day.\
3 Declare his honour unto the heathen, \* and his wonders unto all
peoples.\
4 For the LORD is great, and cannot worthily be praised;\* he is more to
be feared than all gods.\
5 As for all the gods of the heathen, they are but idols; \* but it is
the LORD that made the heavens.\
6 Glory and worship are before him; \* power and honour are in his
sanctuary.\
7 Ascribe unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the peoples, \* ascribe unto
the LORD worship and power.\
8 Ascribe unto the LORD the honour due unto his Name; \* bring presents,
and come into his courts.\
9 O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness; \* let the whole earth
stand in awe of him.\
10 Tell it out among the heathen, that the LORD is King, and that it is
he who hath made the round world so fast that it cannot be moved; \* and
how that he shall judge the peoples righteously.\
11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; \* let the sea
make a noise, and all that therein is.\
12 Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it; \* then shall all the
trees of the wood rejoice before the LORD.\
13 For he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth; \* and with
righteousness to judge the world, and the peoples with his truth.\
\
**\
Psalm 97. Dominus regnavit.**\
THE LORD is King, the earth may be glad thereof; \* yea, the multitude
of the isles may be glad thereof.\
2 Clouds and darkness are round about him: \* righteousness and judgment
are the habitation of his seat.\
3 There shall go a fire before him, \* and burn up his enemies on every
side.\
4 His lightnings gave shine unto the world: \* the earth saw it, and was
afraid.\
5 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD; \* at the
presence of the Lord of the whole earth.\
6 The heavens have declared his righteousness, \* and all the peoples
have seen his glory.\
7 Confounded be all they that worship carved images, and that delight in
vain gods: \* worship him, all ye gods.\
8 Sion heard of it, and rejoiced; and the daughters of Judah were glad,
\* because of thy judgments, O LORD.\
9 For thou, LORD, art higher than all that are in the earth: \* thou art
exalted far above all gods.\
10 O ye that love the LORD, see that ye hate the thing which is evil: \*
the Lord preserveth the souls of his saints; he shall deliver them from
the hand of the ungodly.\
11 There is sprung up a light for the righteous, \* and joyful gladness
for such as are true-hearted.\
12 Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; \* and give thanks for a
remembrance of his holiness.\

Evening Prayer.

**Psalm 98. Cantate Domino**.\
O SING unto the LORD a new song; \* for he hath done marvellous things.\
2 With his own right hand, and with his holy arm, \* hath he gotten
himself the victory.\
3 The LORD declared his salvation; \* his righteousness hath he openly
showed in the sight of the heathen.\
4 He hath remembered his mercy and truth toward the house of Israel; \*
and all the ends of the world have seen the salvation of our God.\
5 Show yourselves joyful unto the LORD, all ye lands; \* sing, rejoice,
and give thanks.\
6 Praise the LORD upon the harp; \* sing to the harp with a psalm of
thanksgiving.\
7 With trumpets also and shawms, \* O show yourselves joyful before the
LORD, the King.\
8 Let the sea make a noise, and all that therein is; \* the round world,
and they that dwell therein.\
9 Let the floods clap their hands, and let the hills be joyful together
before the LORD; \* for he is come to judge the earth.\
10 With righteousness shall he judge the world, \* and the peoples with
equity.\
\
**\
Psalm 99. Dominus regnavit.**\
THE LORD is King, be the people never so impatient; \* he sitteth
between the Cherubim, be the earth never so unquiet.\
2 The LORD is great in Sion, \* and high above all people.\
3 They shall give thanks unto thy Name, \* which is great, wonderful,
and holy.\
4 The King\'s power loveth judgment; thou hast prepared equity, \* thou
hast executed judgment and righteousness in Jacob.\
5 O magnify the LORD our God, and fall down before his footstool; \* for
he is holy.\
6 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among such as call upon
his Name: \* these called upon the LORD, and he heard them.\
7 He spake unto them out of the cloudy pillar; \* for they kept his
testimonies, and the law that he gave them.\
8 Thou heardest them, O LORD our God; \* thou forgavest them, O God,
though thou didst punish their wicked doings.\
9 O magnify the LORD our God, and worship him upon his holy hill; \* for
the LORD our God is holy.\
\
**\
Psalm 100. Jubilate Deo.**\
O BE joyful in the LORD, all ye lands: \* serve the LORD with gladness,
and come before his presence with a song.\
2 Be ye sure that the LORD he is God; it is he that hath made us, and
not we ourselves; \* we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.\
3 O go your way into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts
with praise; \* be thankful unto him, and speak good of his Name.\
4 For the LORD is gracious, his mercy is everlasting; \* and his truth
endureth from generation to generation.\
\
**\
Psalm 101. Misericordiam et judicium.**\
MY song shall be of mercy and judgment; \* unto thee, O LORD, will I
sing.\
2 O let me have understanding \* in the way of godliness!\
3 When wilt thou come unto me? \* I will walk in my house with a perfect
heart.\
4 I will take no wicked thing in hand; I hate the sins of
unfaithfulness; \* there shall no such cleave unto me.\
5 A froward heart shall depart from me; \* I will not know a wicked
person.\
6 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, \* him will I destroy.\
7 Whoso hath also a haughty look and a proud heart, \* I will not suffer
him.\
8 Mine eyes look upon such as are faithful in the land, \* that they may
dwell with me.\
9 Whoso leadeth a godly life, \* he shall be my servant.\
10 There shall no deceitful person dwell in my house; \* he that telleth
lies shall not tarry in my sight.\
11 I shall soon destroy all the ungodly that are in the land; \* that I
may root out all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.\

The Twentieth Day.\
\
Morning Prayer.

**Psalm 102. Domine, exaudi.**\
HEAR my prayer, O LORD, \* and let my crying come unto thee.\
2 Hide not thy face from me in the time of my trouble; \* incline thine
ear unto me when I call; O hear me, and that right soon.\
3 For my days are consumed away like smoke, \* and my bones are burnt up
as it were a firebrand.\
4 My heart is smitten down, and withered like grass; \* so that I forget
to eat my bread.\
5 For the voice of my groaning, \* my bones will scarce cleave to my
flesh.\
6 I am become like a pelican in the wilderness, \* and like an owl that
is in the desert.\
7 I have watched, and am even as it were a sparrow, \* that sitteth
alone upon the housetop.\
8 Mine enemies revile me all the day long; \* and they that are mad upon
me are sworn together against me.\
9 For I have eaten ashes as it were bread, \* and mingled my drink with
weeping;\
10 And that, because of thine indignation and wrath; \* for thou hast
taken me up, and cast me down.\
11 My days are gone like a shadow, \* and I am withered like grass.\
12 But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever, \* and thy remembrance
throughout all generations.\
13 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Sion; \* for it is time that
thou have mercy upon her, yea, the time is come.\
14 And why? thy servants think upon her stones, \* and it pitieth them
to see her in the dust.\
15 The nations shall fear thy Name, O LORD; \* and all the kings of the
earth thy majesty;\
16 When the LORD shall build up Sion, \* and when his glory shall
appear;\
17 When he turneth him unto the prayer of the poor destitute, \* and
despiseth not their desire.\
18 This shall be written for those that come after, \* and the people
which shall be born shall praise the LORD.\
19 For he hath looked down from his sanctuary; \* out of the heaven did
the LORD behold the earth;\
20 That he might hear the mournings of such as are in captivity, \* and
deliver them that are appointed unto death;\
21 That they may declare the Name of the LORD in Sion, \* and his
worship at Jerusalem;\
22 When the peoples are gathered together, \* and the kingdoms also, to
serve the LORD.\
23 He brought down my strength in my journey, \* and shortened my days.\
24 But I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of mine age; \*
as for thy years, they endure throughout all generations.\
25 Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth,
\* and the heavens are the work of thy hands.\
26 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: \* they all shall wax old
as doth a garment;\
27 And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed;
\* but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.\
28 The children of thy servants shall continue, \* and their seed shall
stand fast in thy sight.\
\
**\
Psalm 103. Benedic, anima mea.**\
PRAISE the LORD, O my soul; \* and all that is within me, praise his
holy Name.\
2 Praise the LORD, O my soul, \* and forget not all his benefits:\
3 Who forgiveth all thy sin, \* and healeth all thine infirmities;\
4 Who saveth thy life from destruction, \* and crowneth thee with mercy
and loving-kindness;\
5 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things, \* making thee young and
lusty as an eagle.\
6 The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment \* for all them that are
oppressed with wrong.\
7 He showed his ways unto Moses, \* his works unto the children of
Israel.\
8 The LORD is full of compassion and mercy, \* longsuffering, and of
great goodness.\
9 He will not alway be chiding; \* neither keepeth he his anger for
ever.\
10 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; \* nor rewarded us
according to our wickednesses.\
11 For look how high the heaven is in comparison of the earth; \* so
great is his mercy also toward them that fear him.\
12 Look how wide also the east is from the west; \* so far hath he set
our sins from us.\
13 Yea, like as a father pitieth his own children; \* even so is the
LORD merciful unto them that fear him.\
14 For he knoweth whereof we are made; \* he remembereth that we are but
dust.\
15 The days of man are but as grass; \* for he flourisheth as a flower
of the field.\
16 For as soon as the wind goeth over it, it is gone; \* and the place
thereof shall know it no more.\
17 But the merciful goodness of the LORD endureth for ever and ever upon
them that fear him; \* and his righteousness upon children\'s children;\
18 Even upon such as keep his covenant, \* and think upon his
commandments to do them.\
19 The LORD hath prepared his seat in heaven, \* and his kingdom ruleth
over all.\
20 O praise the LORD, ye angels of his, ye that excel in strength; \* ye
that fulfil his commandment, and hearken unto the voice of his word.\
21 O praise the LORD, all ye his hosts; \* ye servants of his that do
his pleasure.\
22 O speak good of the LORD, all ye works of his, in all places of his
dominion: \* praise thou the LORD, O my soul.\

Evening Prayer.

**Psalm 104. Benedic, anima mea.**\
PRAISE the LORD, O my soul: \* O LORD my God, thou art become exceeding
glorious; thou art clothed with majesty and honour.\
2 Thou deckest thyself with light as it were with a garment, \* and
spreadest out the heavens like a curtain.\
3 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters, \* and maketh the
clouds his chariot, and walketh upon the wings of the wind.\
4 He maketh his angels winds, \* and his ministers a flaming fire.\
5 He laid the foundations of the earth, \* that it never should move at
any time.\
6 Thou coveredst it with the deep like as with a garment; \* the waters
stand above the hills.\
7 At thy rebuke they flee; \* at the voice of thy thunder they haste
away.\
8 They go up as high as the hills, and down to the valleys beneath; \*
even unto the place which thou hast appointed for them.\
9 Thou hast set them their bounds, which they shall not pass, \* neither
turn again to cover the earth.\
10 He sendeth the springs into the rivers, \* which run among the
hills.\
11 All beasts of the field drink thereof, \* and the wild asses quench
their thirst.\
12 Beside them shall the fowls of the air have their habitation, \* and
sing among the branches.\
13 He watereth the hills from above; \* the earth is filled with the
fruit of thy works.\
14 He bringeth forth grass for the cattle, \* and green herb for the
service of men;\
15 That he may bring food out of the earth, and wine that maketh glad
the heart of man; \* and oil to make him a cheerful countenance, and
bread to strengthen man\'s heart.\
16 The trees of the LORD also are full of sap; \* even the cedars of
Lebanon which he hath planted;\
17 Wherein the birds make their nests; \* and the firtrees are a
dwelling for the stork.\
18 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; \* and so are the
stony rocks for the conies.\
19 He appointed the moon for certain seasons, \* and the sun knoweth his
going down.\
20 Thou makest darkness that it may be night; \* wherein all the beasts
of the forest do move.\
21 The lions, roaring after their prey, \* do seek their meat from God.\
22 The sun ariseth, and they get them away together, \* and lay them
down in their dens.\
23 Man goeth forth to his work, and to his labour, \* until the
evening.\
24 O LORD, how manifold are thy works! \* in wisdom hast thou made them
all; the earth is full of thy riches.\
25 So is the great and wide sea also; \* wherein are things creeping
innumerable, both small and great beasts.\
26 There go the ships, and there is that leviathan, \* whom thou hast
made to take his pastime therein.\
27 These wait all upon thee, \* that thou mayest give them meat in due
season.\
28 When thou givest it them, they gather it; \* and when thou openest
thy hand, they are filled with good.\
29 When thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: \* when thou takest
away their breath, they die, and are turned again to their dust.\
30 When thou lettest thy breath go forth, they shall be made; \* and
thou shalt renew the face of the earth.\
31 The glorious majesty of the LORD shall endure for ever; \* the LORD
shall rejoice in his works.\
32 The earth shall tremble at the look of him; \* if he do but touch the
hills, they shall smoke.\
33 I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live; \* I will praise my God
while I have my being.\
34 And so shall my words please him: \* my joy shall be in the LORD.\
35 As for sinners, they shall be consumed out of the earth, \* and the
ungodly shall come to an end.\
36 Praise thou the LORD, O my soul. \* Praise the LORD.\

The Twenty-first Day.\
\
Morning Prayer.

**Psalm 105. Confitemini Domino.**\
GIVE thanks unto the LORD, and call upon his Name; \* tell the people
what things he hath done.\
2 O let your songs be of him, and praise him; \* and let your talking be
of all his wondrous works.\
3 Rejoice in his holy Name; \* let the heart of them rejoice that seek
the LORD.\
4 Seek the LORD and his strength; \* seek his face evermore.\
5 Remember the marvellous works that he hath done; \* his wonders, and
the judgments of his mouth;\
6 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, \* ye children of Jacob his chosen.\
7 He is the LORD our God; \* his judgments are in all the world.\
8 He hath been alway mindful of his covenant and promise, \* that he
made to a thousand generations;\
9 Even the covenant that he made with Abraham; \* and the oath that he
sware unto Isaac;\
10 And appointed the same unto Jacob for a law, \* and to Israel for an
everlasting testament;\
11 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, \* the lot of your
inheritance:\
12 When there were yet but a few of them, \* and they strangers in the
land;\
13 What time as they went from one nation to another, \* from one
kingdom to another people;\
14 He suffered no man to do them wrong, \* but reproved even kings for
their sakes;\
15 Touch not mine anointed, \* and do my prophets no harm.\
16 Moreover, he called for a dearth upon the land, \* and destroyed all
the provision of bread.\
17 But he had sent a man before them, \* even Joseph, who was sold to be
a bond-servant;\
18 Whose feet they hurt in the stocks; \* the iron entered into his
soul;\
19 Until the time came that his cause was known: \* the word of the LORD
tried him.\
20 The king sent, and delivered him; \* the prince of the people let him
go free.\
21 He made him lord also of his house, \* and ruler of all his
substance;\
22 That he might inform his princes after his will, \* and teach his
senators wisdom.\
23 Israel also came into Egypt, \* and Jacob was a stranger in the land
of Ham.\
24 And he increased his people exceedingly, \* and made them stronger
than their enemies;\
25 Whose heart turned so, that they hated his people, \* and dealt
untruly with his servants.\
26 Then sent he Moses his servant, \* and Aaron whom he had chosen.\
27 And these showed his tokens among them, \* and wonders in the land of
Ham.\
28 He sent darkness, and it was dark; \* and they were not obedient unto
his word.\
29 He turned their waters into blood, \* and slew their fish.\
30 Their land brought forth frogs; \* yea, even in their kings\'
chambers.\
31 He spake the word, and there came all manner of flies, \* and lice in
all their quarters.\
32 He gave them hailstones for rain; \* and flames of fire in their
land.\
33 He smote their vines also and fig-trees; \* and destroyed the trees
that were in their coasts.\
34 He spake the word, and the grasshoppers came, and caterpillars
innumerable, \* and did eat up all the grass in their land, and devoured
the fruit of their ground.\
35 He smote all the firstborn in their land; \* even the chief of all
their strength.\
36 He brought them forth also with silver and gold; \* there was not one
feeble person among their tribes.\
37 Egypt was glad at their departing; \* for they were afraid of them.\
38 He spread out a cloud to be a covering, \* and fire to give light in
the night season.\
39 At their desire he brought quails; \* and he filled them with the
bread of heaven.\
40 He opened the rock of stone, and the waters flowed out, \* so that
rivers ran in the dry places.\
41 For why? he remembered his holy promise; \* and Abraham his servant.\
42 And he brought forth his people with joy, \* and his chosen with
gladness;\
43 And gave them the lands of the heathen; \* and they took the labours
of the people in possession;\
44 That they might keep his statutes, \* and observe his laws.\

Evening Prayer.

**Psalm 106. Confitemini Domino.**\
O GIVE thanks unto the LORD; for he is gracious, \* and his mercy
endureth for ever.\
2 Who can express the noble acts of the LORD, \* or show forth all his
praise?\
3 Blessed are they that alway keep judgment, \* and do righteousness.\
4 Remember me, O LORD, according to the favour that thou bearest unto
thy people; \* O visit me with thy salvation;\
5 That I may see the felicity of thy chosen, \* and rejoice in the
gladness of thy people, and give thanks with thine inheritance.\
6 We have sinned with our fathers; \* we have done amiss, and dealt
wickedly.\
7 Our fathers regarded not thy wonders in Egypt, neither kept they thy
great goodness in remembrance; \* but were disobedient at the sea, even
at the Red Sea.\
8 Nevertheless, he helped them for his Name\'s sake, \* that he might
make his power to be known.\
9 He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up; \* so he led them
through the deep, as through a wilderness.\
10 And he saved them from the adversary\'s hand, \* and delivered them
from the hand of the enemy.\
11 As for those that troubled them, the waters overwhelmed them; \*
there was not one of them left.\
12 Then believed they his words, \* and sang praise unto him.\
13 But within a while they forgat his works, \* and would not abide his
counsel.\
14 But lust came upon them in the wilderness, \* and they tempted God in
the desert.\
15 And he gave them their desire, \* and sent leanness withal into their
soul.\
16 They angered Moses also in the tents, \* and Aaron the saint of the
LORD.\
17 So the earth opened, and swallowed up Dathan, \* and covered the
congregation of Abiram.\
18 And the fire was kindled in their company; \* the flame burnt up the
ungodly.\
19 They made a calf in Horeb, \* and worshipped the molten image.\
20 Thus they turned their glory \* into the similitude of a calf that
eateth hay.\
21 And they forgat God their Saviour, \* who had done so great things in
Egypt;\
22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham; \* and fearful things by the Red
Sea.\
23 So he said he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his chosen
stood before him in the gap, \* to turn away his wrathful indignation,
lest he should destroy them.\
24 Yea, they thought scorn of that pleasant land, \* and gave no
credence unto his word;\
25 But murmured in their tents, \* and hearkened not unto the voice of
the LORD.\
26 Then lift he up his hand against them, \* to overthrow them in the
wilderness;\
27 To cast out their seed among the nations, \* and to scatter them in
the lands.\
28 They joined themselves unto Baal-peor, \* and ate the offerings of
the dead.\
29 Thus they provoked him to anger with their own inventions; \* and the
plague was great among them.\
30 Then stood up Phinehas, and interposed; \* and so the plague ceased.\
31 And that was counted unto him for righteousness, \* among all
posterities for evermore.\
32 They angered him also at the waters of strife, \* so that he punished
Moses for their sakes;\
33 Because they provoked his spirit, \* so that he spake unadvisedly
with his lips.\
34 Neither destroyed they the heathen, \* as the LORD commanded them;\
35 But were mingled among the heathen, \* and learned their works.\
36 Insomuch that they worshipped their idols, which became a snare unto
them; \* yea, they offered their sons and their daughters unto devils;\
37 And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their
daughters, \* whom they offered unto the idols of Canaan; and the land
was defiled with blood.\
38 Thus were they stained with their own works, \* and went a whoring
with their own inventions.\
39 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, \*
insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.\
40 And he gave them over into the hand of the heathen; \* and they that
hated them were lords over them.\
41 Their enemies oppressed them, \* and had them in subjection.\
42 Many a time did he deliver them; \* but they rebelled against him
with their own inventions, and were brought down in their wickedness.\
43 Nevertheless, when he saw their adversity, \* he heard their
complaint.\
44 He thought upon his covenant, and pitied them, according unto the
multitude of his mercies; \* yea, he made all those that led them away
captive to pity them.\
45 Deliver us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen; \*
that we may give thanks unto thy holy Name, and make our boast of thy
praise.\
46 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, from everlasting, and world
without end; \* And let all the people say, Amen.\
