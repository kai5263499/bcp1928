| **Psalm 83. Deus, quis similis?**\                                    |
| HOLD not thy tongue, O God, keep not still silence: \* refrain not    |
| thyself, O God.\                                                      |
| 2 For lo, thine enemies make a murmuring; \* and they that hate thee  |
| have lift up their head.\                                             |
| 3 They have imagined craftily against thy people, \* and taken        |
| counsel against thy secret ones.\                                     |
| 4 They have said, Come, and let us root them out, that they be no     |
| more a people, \* and that the name of Israel may be no more in       |
| remembrance.\                                                         |
| 5 For they have cast their heads together with one consent, \* and    |
| are confederate against thee:\                                        |
| 6 The tabernacles of the Edomites, and the Ishmaelites; \* the        |
| Moabites, and Hagarenes;\                                             |
| 7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; \* the Philistines, with them that    |
| dwell at Tyre.\                                                       |
| 8 Assyria also is joined with them; \* they have holpen the children  |
| of Lot.\                                                              |
| 9 But do thou to them as unto the Midianites; \* unto Sisera, and     |
| unto Jabin at the brook of Kishon;\                                   |
| 10 Who perished at Endor, \* and became as the dung of the earth.\    |
| 11 Make them and their princes like Oreb and Zeeb; \* yea, make all   |
| their princes like as Zebah and Zalmunna;\                            |
| 12 Who say, Let us take to ourselves \* the houses of God in          |
| possession.\                                                          |
| 13 O my God, make them like unto the whirling dust, \* and as the     |
| stubble before the wind;\                                             |
| 14 Like as the fire that burneth up the forest, \* and as the flame   |
| that consumeth the mountains;\                                        |
| 15 Pursue them even so with thy tempest, \* and make them afraid with |
| thy storm.\                                                           |
| 16 Make their faces ashamed, O LORD, \* that they may seek thy Name.\ |
| 17 Let them be confounded and vexed ever more and more; \* let them   |
| be put to shame, and perish.\                                         |
| 18 And they shall know that thou, whose Name is JEHOVAH, \* art only  |
| the Most Highest over all the earth.                                  |
