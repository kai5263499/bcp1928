**Psalm 50. Deus deorum.**\
THE LORD, even the Most Mighty God, hath spoken, \* and called the
world, from the rising up of the sun unto the going down thereof.\
2 Out of Sion hath God appeared \* in perfect beauty.\
3 Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence; \* there shall go
before him a consuming fire, and a mighty tempest shall be stirred up
round about him.\
4 He shall call the heaven from above, \* and the earth, that he may
judge his people.\
5 Gather my saints together unto me; \* those that have made a covenant
with me with sacrifice.\
6 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness; \* for God is Judge
himself.\
7 Hear, O my people, and I will speak; \* I myself will testify against
thee, O Israel; for I am God, even thy God.\
8 I will not reprove thee because of thy sacrifices; \* as for thy
burnt-offerings, they are alway before me.\
9 I will take no bullock out of thine house, \* nor he-goats out of thy
folds.\
10 For all the beasts of the forest are mine, \* and so are the cattle
upon a thousand hills.\
11 I know all the fowls upon the mountains, \* and the wild beasts of
the field are in my sight.\
12 If I be hungry, I will not tell thee; \* for the whole world is mine,
and all that is therein.\
13 Thinkest thou that I will eat bulls\' flesh, \* and drink the blood
of goats?\
14 Offer unto God thanksgiving, \* and pay thy vows unto the Most
Highest.\
15 And call upon me in the time of trouble; \* so will I hear thee, and
thou shalt praise me.\
16 But unto the ungodly saith God, \* Why dost thou preach my laws, and
takest my covenant in thy mouth;\
17 Whereas thou hatest to be reformed, \* and hast cast my words behind
thee?\
18 When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst unto him; \* and hast been
partaker with the adulterers.\
19 Thou hast let thy mouth speak wickedness, \* and with thy tongue thou
hast set forth deceit.\
20 Thou sattest and spakest against thy brother; \* yea, and hast
slandered thine own mother\'s son.\
21 These things hast thou done, and I held my tongue, and thou
thoughtest wickedly, that I am even such a one as thyself; \* but I will
reprove thee, and set before thee the things that thou hast done.\
22 O consider this, ye that forget God, \* lest I pluck you away, and
there be none to deliver you.\
23 Whoso offereth me thanks and praise, he honoureth me; \* and to him
that ordereth his way aright, will I show the salvation of God.\

**Psalm 51. Miserere mei, Deus.**\
HAVE mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness; \* according to the
multitude of thy mercies do away mine offences.\
2 Wash me throughly from my wickedness, \* and cleanse me from my sin.\
3 For I acknowledge my faults, \* and my sin is ever before me.\
4 Against thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight; \*
that thou mightest be justified in thy saying, and clear when thou shalt
judge.\
5 Behold, I was shapen in wickedness, \* and in sin hath my mother
conceived me.\
6 But lo, thou requirest truth in the inward parts, \* and shalt make me
to understand wisdom secretly.\
7 Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; \* thou shalt
wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.\
8 Thou shalt make me hear of joy and gladness, \* that the bones which
thou hast broken may rejoice.\
9 Turn thy face from my sins, \* and put out all my misdeeds.\
10 Make me a clean heart, O God, \* and renew a right spirit within me.\
11 Cast me not away from thy presence, \* and take not thy holy Spirit
from me.\
12 O give me the comfort of thy help again, \* and stablish me with thy
free Spirit.\
13 Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked, \* and sinners shall be
converted unto thee.\
14 Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou that art the God of my
health; \* and my tongue shall sing of thy righteousness.\
15 Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord, \* and my mouth shall show thy
praise.\
16 For thou desirest no sacrifice, else would I give it thee; \* but
thou delightest not in burnt-offerings.\
17 The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit: \* a broken and contrite
heart, O God, shalt thou not despise.\
18 O be favourable and gracious unto Sion; \* build thou the walls of
Jerusalem.\
19 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness, with
the burnt-offerings and oblations; \* then shall they offer young
bullocks upon thine altar.\

**Psalm 52. Quid gloriaris?**\
WHY boastest thou thyself, thou tyrant, \* that thou canst do mischief;\
2 Whereas the goodness of God \* endureth yet daily?\
3 Thy tongue imagineth wickedness, \* and with lies thou cuttest like a
sharp razor.\
4 Thou hast loved unrighteousness more than goodness, \* and falsehood
more than righteousness.\
5 Thou hast loved to speak all words that may do hurt, \* O thou false
tongue.\
6 Therefore shall God destroy thee for ever; \* he shall take thee, and
pluck thee out of thy dwelling, and root thee out of the land of the
living.\
7 The righteous also shall see this, and fear, \* and shall laugh him to
scorn:\
8 Lo, this is the man that took not God for his strength; \* but trusted
unto the multitude of his riches, and strengthened himself in his
wickedness.\
9 As for me, I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God; \* my
trust is in the tender mercy of God for ever and ever.\
10 I will alway give thanks unto thee for that thou hast done; \* and I
will hope in thy Name, for thy saints like it well.
