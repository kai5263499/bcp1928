| **Psalm 54. Deus, in Nomine.**\                                       |
| SAVE me, O God, for thy Name\'s sake, \* and avenge me in thy         |
| strength.\                                                            |
| 2 Hear my prayer, O God, \* and hearken unto the words of my mouth.\  |
| 3 For strangers are risen up against me; \* and tyrants, which have   |
| not God before their eyes, seek after my soul.\                       |
| 4 Behold, God is my helper; \* the Lord is with them that uphold my   |
| soul.\                                                                |
| 5 He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: \* destroy thou them in thy |
| truth.\                                                               |
| 6 An offering of a free heart will I give thee, and praise thy Name,  |
| O LORD; \* because it is so comfortable.\                             |
| 7 For he hath delivered me out of all my trouble; \* and mine eye     |
| hath seen his desire upon mine enemies.                               |
