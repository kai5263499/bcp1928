| all thy soul, and with all thy might.\                                |

| 22 And the LORD showed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, |
| upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes:\           |

| **[]{#anchor143903}1 And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as     |
| unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.\    |
| 2 I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were   |
| not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.\                    |
| []{#anchor147853}3 For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among  |
| you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk   |
| as men?\                                                              |
| 4 For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos;    |
| are ye not carnal?\                                                   |
| 5 Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye      |
| believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?\                        |
| 6 I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.\        |
| 7 So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that      |
| watereth; but God that giveth the increase.\                          |
| 8 Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man    |
| shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.\            |
| 9 For we are labourers together with God: ye are God\'s husbandry, ye |
| are God\'s building.\                                                 |
| 10 According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise    |
| masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth       |
| thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.\      |
| []{#anchor149578}11 For other foundation can no man lay than that is  |
| laid, which is Jesus Christ.\                                         |
| 12 Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious   |
| stones, wood, hay, stubble;\                                          |
| []{#anchor151716}13 Every man\'s work shall be made manifest: for the |
| day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the   |
| fire shall try every man\'s work of what sort it is.\                 |
| 14 If any man\'s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall   |
| receive a reward.\                                                    |
| 15 If any man\'s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he   |
| himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.\                           |
| 16 Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of  |
| God dwelleth in you?\                                                 |
| 17 If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for    |
| the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.\                      |
| 18 Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be     |
| wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.\      |
| 19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is    |
| written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.\                 |
| 20 And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they    |
| are vain.\                                                            |
| 21 Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;\      |
| 22 Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or     |
| death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;\          |
| 23 And ye are Christ\'s; and Christ is God\'s.\                       |

| Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him,    |
| Here am I.\                                                           |
| 14 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with   |
| thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So   |
| he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.\       |
| 15 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the  |
| field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?\             |
| 16 And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they  |
| feed their flocks.\                                                   |
| 17 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say,   |
| Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found    |
| them in Dothan.\                                                      |

| them, they conspired against him to slay him.\                        |
| 19 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.\        |
| 20 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some    |
| pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall |
| see what will become of his dreams.\                                  |
| 21 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and  |
| said, Let us not kill him.\                                           |
| 22 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this   |
| pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he      |
| might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father        |
| again.\                                                               |

| they stripped Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that   |
| was on him;\                                                          |
| 24 And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, |
| there was no water in it.\                                            |
| 25 And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and  |
| looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with   |
| their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it    |
| down to Egypt.\                                                       |
| 26 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our |
| brother, and conceal his blood?\                                      |
| 27 Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand |
| be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren    |
| were content.\                                                        |
| 28 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and     |
| lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites   |
| for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.\     |
| 36 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer   |
| of Pharaoh\'s, and captain of the guard.\                             |

| 10 And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it       |
| budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought |
| forth ripe grapes:\                                                   |

| three branches are three days:\                                       |
| 13 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and        |
| restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh\'s cup    |
| into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.\    |
| 14 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and show          |
| kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh,  |
| and bring me out of this house:\                                      |

| unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white   |
| baskets on my head:\                                                  |

| 18 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof:  |
| The three baskets are three days:\                                    |

| 26 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are   |
| seven years: the dream is one.\                                       |

| shall be seven years of famine.\                                      |
| 28 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is    |
| about to do he showeth unto Pharaoh.\                                 |
| 29 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the  |
| land of Egypt:\                                                       |

| the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine    |
| shall consume the land;\                                              |

| famine following; for it shall be very grievous.\                     |

| set him over the land of Egypt.\                                      |
| 34 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land,   |
| and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven          |
| plenteous years.\                                                     |

| years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land   |
| perish not through the famine.\                                       |

| is, a man in whom the spirit of God is?\                              |

| servants come.\                                                       |

| 13 And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one   |
| man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with |
| our father, and one is not.\                                          |

| saying, Ye are spies:\                                                |
| 15 Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go  |
| forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.\               |
| 16 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be   |
| kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any   |
| truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.\    |
| 17 And he put them all together into ward three days.\                |
| 18 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I  |
| fear God:\                                                            |
| 19 If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house  |
| of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:\     |
| 20 But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be    |
| verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.\                     |
| 21 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our  |
| brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, |
| and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.\      |
| 22 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do |
| not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold,  |
| also his blood is required.\                                          |

| them by an interpreter.\                                              |
| 24 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to   |
| them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and    |
| bound him before their eyes.\                                         |
| 25 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to        |
| restore every man\'s money into his sack, and to give them provision  |
| for the way: and thus did he unto them.\                              |
| 26 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.\    |
| 29 And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan,\    |
| 35 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold,     |
| every man\'s bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and  |
| their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.\             |
| 36 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my   |
| children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin |
| away: all these things are against me.\                               |
| 37 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I   |
| bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him |
| to thee again.\                                                       |
| 38 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is |

| which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to    |

| []{#anchor453136}18 For first of all, when ye come together in the    |

| approved may be made manifest among you.\                             |
| 20 When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat |

| one is hungry, and another is drunken.\                               |
| 22 What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the |
| church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? |
| shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.\                        |
| 23 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto   |

| 25 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped,    |
| saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft |
| as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.\                                |

| the Lord\'s death till he come.\                                      |

| the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the    |
| Lord.\                                                                |

| 1 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you      |
| ignorant.\                                                            |

| even as ye were led.\                                                 |
| 3 Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the     |
| Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that    |
| Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.\                            |
| 4 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.\           |
| 5 And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.\   |
| 6 And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God     |
| which worketh all in all.\                                            |

| withal.\                                                              |

| the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;\                            |
| 9 To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of        |
| healing by the same Spirit;\                                          |
| 10 To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to        |
| another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to |
| another the interpretation of tongues:\                               |
