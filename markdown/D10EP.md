**Psalm 53. Dixit insipiens.**\
THE foolish body hath said in his heart, \* There is no God.\
2 Corrupt are they, and become abominable in their wickedness; \* there
is none that doeth good.\
3 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, \* to see if
there were any that would understand, and seek after God.\
4 But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become
abominable; \* there is also none that doeth good, no not one.\
5 Are not they without understanding that work wickedness, \* eating up
my people as if they would eat bread? they have not called upon God.\
6 They were afraid where no fear was; \* for God hath broken the bones
of him that besieged thee; thou hast put them to confusion, because God
hath despised them.\
7 O that the salvation were given unto Israel out of Sion! \* O that the
Lord would deliver his people out of captivity!\
8 Then should Jacob rejoice, \* and Israel should be right glad.\

**Psalm 54. Deus, in Nomine.**\
SAVE me, O God, for thy Name\'s sake, \* and avenge me in thy strength.\
2 Hear my prayer, O God, \* and hearken unto the words of my mouth.\
3 For strangers are risen up against me; \* and tyrants, which have not
God before their eyes, seek after my soul.\
4 Behold, God is my helper; \* the Lord is with them that uphold my
soul.\
5 He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: \* destroy thou them in thy
truth.\
6 An offering of a free heart will I give thee, and praise thy Name, O
LORD; \* because it is so comfortable.\
7 For he hath delivered me out of all my trouble; \* and mine eye hath
seen his desire upon mine enemies.\

**Psalm 55. Exaudi, Deus.**\
HEAR my prayer, O God, \* and hide not thyself from my petition.\
2 Take heed unto me, and hear me, \* how I mourn in my prayer, and am
vexed;\
3 The enemy crieth so, and the ungodly cometh on so fast; \* for they
are minded to do me some mischief, so maliciously are they set against
me.\
4 My heart is disquieted within me, \* and the fear of death is fallen
upon me.\
5 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, \* and an horrible dread
hath overwhelmed me.\
6 And I said, O that I had wings like a dove! \* for then would I flee
away, and be at rest.\
7 Lo, then would I get me away far off, \* and remain in the
wilderness.\
8 I would make haste to escape, \* because of the stormy wind and
tempest.\
9 Destroy their tongues, O Lord, and divide them; \* for I have spied
unrighteousness and strife in the city.\
10 Day and night they go about within the walls thereof: \* mischief
also and sorrow are in the midst of it.\
11 Wickedness is therein; \* deceit and guile go not out of her
streets.\
12 For it is not an open enemy that hath done me this dishonour; \* for
then I could have borne it;\
13 Neither was it mine adversary that did magnify himself against me; \*
for then peradventure I would have hid myself from him;\
14 But it was even thou, my companion, \* my guide, and mine own
familiar friend.\
15 We took sweet counsel together, \* and walked in the house of God as
friends.\
16 Let death come hastily upon them, and let them go down alive into the
pit; \* for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.\
17 As for me, I will call upon God, \* and the LORD shall save me.\
18 In the evening, and morning, and at noon-day will I pray, and that
instantly; \* and he shall hear my voice.\
19 It is he that hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that
was against me; \* for there were many that strove with me.\
20 Yea, even God, that endureth for ever, shall hear me, and bring them
down; \* for they will not turn, nor fear God.\
21 He laid his hands upon such as be at peace with him, \* and he brake
his covenant.\
22 The words of his mouth were softer than butter, having war in his
heart; \* his words were smoother than oil, and yet be they very
swords.\
23 O cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall nourish thee, \* and
shall not suffer the righteous to fall for ever.\
24 And as for them, \* thou, O God, shalt bring them into the pit of
destruction.\
25 The blood-thirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their
days: \* nevertheless, my trust shall be in thee, O Lord.
