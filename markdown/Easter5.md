| 5 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for |
| they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of    |

| They have their reward.\                                              |

| hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy    |
| Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.\               |
| 7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for  |
| they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.\         |
| 8 Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what    |
| things ye have need of, before ye ask him.\                           |

| for sins:\                                                            |
| 2 Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out   |
| of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.\    |
| 3 And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for       |
| himself, to offer for sins.\                                          |

| of God, as was Aaron.\                                                |

| one accord in one place.\                                             |
| 2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty  |
| wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.\           |
| 3 And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it |
| sat upon each of them.\                                               |
| 4 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak    |
| with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.\               |
| 5 And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every |
| nation under heaven.\                                                 |

| were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own   |
| language.\                                                            |

| Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?\                    |
| 8 And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?\ |
| 9 Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in             |
| Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,\     |

| Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,\                  |

| wonderful works of God.\                                              |
| 12 And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to         |
| another, What meaneth this?\                                          |
| 13 Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.\              |
| 14 But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and   |
| said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, |
| be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:\                     |
