| **Psalm 92. Bonum est confiteri.**\                                   |
| IT is a good thing to give thanks unto the LORD, \* and to sing       |
| praises unto thy Name, O Most Highest;\                               |
| 2 To tell of thy loving-kindness early in the morning, \* and of thy  |
| truth in the night season;\                                           |
| 3 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the lute; \* upon a     |
| loud instrument, and upon the harp.\                                  |
| 4 For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy works; \* and I will  |
| rejoice in giving praise for the operations of thy hands.\            |
| 5 O LORD, how glorious are thy works! \* thy thoughts are very deep.\ |
| 6 An unwise man doth not well consider this, \* and a fool doth not   |
| understand it.\                                                       |
| 7 When the ungodly are green as the grass, and when all the workers   |
| of wickedness do flourish, \* then shall they be destroyed for ever;  |
| but thou, LORD, art the Most Highest for evermore.\                   |
| 8 For lo, thine enemies, O LORD, lo, thine enemies shall perish; \*   |
| and all the workers of wickedness shall be destroyed.\                |
| 9 But my horn shall be exalted like the horn of an unicorn; \* for I  |
| am anointed with fresh oil.\                                          |
| 10 Mine eye also shall see his lust of mine enemies, \* and mine ear  |
| shall hear his desire of the wicked that arise up against me.\        |
| 11 The righteous shall flourish like a palm-tree, \* and shall spread |
| abroad like a cedar in Lebanon.\                                      |
| 12 Such as are planted in the house of the LORD, \* shall flourish in |
| the courts of the house of our God.\                                  |
| 13 They also shall bring forth more fruit in their age, \* and shall  |
| be fat and well-liking;\                                              |
| 14 That they may show how true the LORD my strength is, \* and that   |
| there is no unrighteousness in him.                                   |
