## The Form of Consecration of a Church or Chapel {#the-form-of-consecration-of-a-church-or-chapel align="CENTER"}

###### *¶ The following Office may be used with the Order for the Holy Communion, or at Morning Prayer or Evening Prayer, or separately.  ¶ The Bishop is to be received at the entrance of the Church, or Chapel, by the Church-wardens and Vestrymen, or some other persons appointed for that purpose. The Bishop and the Clergy who are present shall go up the aisle of the Church, or Chapel, to the Holy Table, repeating the following Psalm alternately, the Bishop one verse and the Clergy another.*

\
\
**Domini est terra. Psalm xxiv.**\
THE earth is the LORD\'S, and all that therein is; \* the compass of the
world, and they that dwell therein.\
2 For he hath founded it upon the seas, \* and stablished it upon the
floods.\
3 Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? \* or who shall rise up in
his holy place?\
4 Even he that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; \* and that hath not
lift up his mind unto vanity, nor sworn to deceive his neighbour.\
5 He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, \* and righteousness from
the God of his salvation.\
6 This is the generation of them that seek him; \* even of them that
seek thy face, O Jacob.\
7 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting
doors; \* and the King of glory shall come in.\
8 Who is this King of glory? \* It is the LORD strong and mighty, even
the LORD mighty in battle.\
9 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting
doors; \* and the King of glory shall come in.\
10 Who is this King of glory? \* Even the LORD of hosts, he is the King
of glory.\
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, \* and to the Holy Ghost;\
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, \* world without
end. Amen.

###### * ¶ The Bishop shall go within the rails, with such of the Clergy as can be there accommodated. The Bishop, sitting in his chair, shall have the instruments of Donation and Endowment, if there be any, presented to him; and then standing up, and turning to the Congregation, he shall say,*

\
DEARLY beloved in the Lord; forasmuch as devout and holy men, as well
under the Law as under the Gospel, moved either by the express command
of God, or by the secret inspiration of the blessed Spirit, and acting
agreeably to their own reason and sense of the natural decency of
things, have erected houses for the public worship of God, and separated
them from all unhallowed, worldly, and common uses, in order to fill
men\'s minds with greater reverence for his glorious Majesty, and affect
their hearts with more devotion and humility in his service; which pious
works have been approved of and graciously accepted by our heavenly
Father; Let us not doubt but that he will also favourably approve our
godly purpose of setting apart this place in solemn manner, for the
several Offices of religious worship, and let us faithfully and devoutly
beg his blessing on this our undertaking.

###### *¶ Then the Bishop, kneeling, shall say the following Prayer.* {#then-the-bishop-kneeling-shall-say-the-following-prayer. align="CENTER"}

\
O ETERNAL God, mighty in power, and of majesty incomprehensible, whom
the heaven of heavens cannot contain, much less the walls of temples
made with hands; and who yet hast been graciously pleased to promise thy
especial presence, wherever two or three of thy faithful servants shall
assemble in thy Name, to offer up their praises and supplications unto
thee; Vouchsafe, O Lord, to be present with us, who are here gathered
together with all humility and readiness of heart, to consecrate this
place to the honour of thy great Name; separating it henceforth from all
unhallowed, ordinary, and common uses; and dedicating it to thy service,
for reading thy holy Word, for celebrating thy holy Sacraments, for
offering to thy glorious Majesty the sacrifices of prayer and
thanksgiving, for blessing thy people in thy Name, and for all other
holy offices: accept, O Lord, this service at our hands, and bless it
with such success as may tend most to thy glory, and the furtherance of
our happiness both tem- poral and spiritual; through Jesus Christ our
blessed Lord and Saviour. **Amen.**

###### * ¶ After this the Bishop shall stand up, and turning his face towards the Congregation, shall say,*

\
REGARD, O Lord, the supplications of thy servants, and grant that
whosoever in this house shall be received by Baptism into the
congregation of Christ\'s flock, may be sanctified by the Holy Ghost,
and may continue Christ\'s faithful soldier and servant unto his life\'s
end. **Amen.**\
\
GRANT, O Lord, that they who at this place shall in their own persons
renew the promises and vows of their Baptism, and be Confirmed by the
Bishop, may receive such a measure of thy Holy Spirit, that they may
grow in grace unto their life\'s end. **Amen.**\
\
GRANT, O Lord, that whosoever shall receive in this place the blessed
Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ, may come to that holy
ordinance with faith, charity, and true repentance; and being filled
with thy grace and heavenly benediction, may, to their great and endless
comfort, obtain remission of their sins, and all other benefits of his
passion. **Amen.**\
\
GRANT, O Lord, that by thy holy Word which shall be read and preached in
this place, and by thy Holy Spirit grafting it inwardly in the heart,
the hearers thereof may both perceive and know what things they ought to
do, and may have power and strength to fulfil the same. **Amen.**\
\
GRANT, O Lord, that whosoever shall be joined to- gether in this place
in the holy estate of Matrimony, may faithfully perform and keep the vow
and covenant betwixt them made, and may remain in perfect love together
unto their life\'s end. **Amen.**\
\
GRANT, we beseech thee, blessed Lord, that whosoever shall draw near to
thee in this place, to give thee thanks for the benefits which they have
received at thy hands, to set forth thy most worthy praise, to confess
their sins unto thee, and to ask such things as are requisite and
necessary, as well for the body as for the soul, may do it with such
steadiness of faith, and with such seriousness, affection, and devotion
of mind, that thou mayest accept their bounden duty and service, and
vouchsafe to give whatever in thy infinite wisdom thou shalt see to be
most expedient for them. All which we beg for Jesus Christ\'s sake, our
most blessed Lord and Saviour. **Amen.**

###### *¶ Then, the Bishop sitting in his chair, the Sentence of Consecration is to be read by some person appointed by him, and then laid by him upon the Communion Table; after which, the Bishop shall say,*

\
BLESSED be thy Name, O Lord, that it hath pleased thee to put it into
the hearts of thy servants to appropriate and devote this house to thy
honour and worship; and grant that all who shall enjoy the benefit of
this pious work, may show forth their thankfulness, by making a right
use of it, to the glory of thy blessed Name; through Jesus Christ our
Lord. Amen.

###### *¶ When there is a Communion, the following shall be the Collect, Epistle, and Gospel.*

**The Collect.**

MOST glorious God, whom the heaven of heavens cannot contain; Graciously
accept the Dedication of this place to thy service; and grant that all
who shall call upon thee here may worship thee in spirit and in truth,
and may in their lives show forth thy praise; through Jesus Christ our
Lord. Amen.\

**For the Epistle.** *Revelation xxi. 2.*

AND I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of
heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great
voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men,
and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God
himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away
all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither
sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former
things are passed away. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I
make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are
true and faithful.\

**The Gospel. ** *St. John ii. 13.*

AND the Jews\' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem, and
found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the
changers of money sitting: and when he had made a scourge of small
cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen;
and poured out the changers\' money, and overthrew the tables; and said
unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my
Father\'s house an house of merchandise. And his disciples remembered
that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.

###### *¶ And immediately before the final Blessing, the Bishop shall say this Prayer.* {#and-immediately-before-the-final-blessing-the-bishop-shall-say-this-prayer. align="CENTER"}

\
BLESSED be thy Name, O Lord God, for that it hath pleased thee to have
thy habitation among the sons of men, and to dwell in the midst of the
assembly of the saints upon the earth; Grant, we beseech thee, that in
this place now set apart to thy service, thy holy Name may be worshipped
in truth and purity through all generations; through Jesus Christ our
Lord. Amen.\
\
THE Peace of God, which passeth all understanding, keep your hearts and
minds in the knowledge and love of God, and of his Son Jesus Christ our
Lord: And the Blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Ghost, be amongst you, and remain with you always. Amen.
