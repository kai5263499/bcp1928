**Psalm 89. Misericordias Domini.**\
MY song shall be alway of the loving-kindness of the LORD; \* with my
mouth will I ever be showing thy truth from one generation to another.\
2 For I have said, Mercy shall be set up for ever; \* thy truth shalt
thou stablish in the heavens.\
3 I have made a covenant with my chosen; \* I have sworn unto David my
servant:\
4 Thy seed will I stablish for ever, \* and set up thy throne from one
generation to another.\
5 O LORD, the very heavens shall praise thy wondrous works; \* and thy
truth in the congregation of the saints.\
6 For who is he among the clouds, \* that shall be compared unto the
LORD?\
7 And what is he among the gods, \* that shall be like unto the LORD?\
8 God is very greatly to be feared in the council of the saints, \* and
to be had in reverence of all them that are round about him.\
9 O Lord God of hosts, who is like unto thee? \* thy truth, most mighty
LORD, is on every side.\
10 Thou rulest the raging of the sea; \* thou stillest the waves thereof
when they arise.\
11 Thou hast subdued Egypt, and destroyed it; \* thou hast scattered
thine enemies abroad with thy mighty arm.\
12 The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine; \* thou hast laid the
foundation of the round world, and all that therein is.\
13 Thou hast made the north and the south; \* Tabor and Hermon shall
rejoice in thy Name.\
14 Thou hast a mighty arm; \* strong is thy hand, and high is thy right
hand.\
15 Righteousness and equity are the habitation of thy seat; \* mercy and
truth shall go before thy face.\
16 Blessed is the people, O LORD, that can rejoice in thee; \* they
shall walk in the light of thy countenance.\
17 Their delight shall be daily in thy Name; \* and in thy righteousness
shall they make their boast.\
18 For thou art the glory of their strength, \* and in thy
loving-kindness thou shalt lift up our horns.\
19 For the LORD is our defence; \* the Holy One of Israel is our King.\
20 Thou spakest sometime in visions unto thy saints, and saidst, \* I
have laid help upon one that is mighty, I have exalted one chosen out of
the people.\
21 I have found David my servant; \* with my holy oil have I anointed
him.\
22 My hand shall hold him fast, \* and my arm shall strengthen him.\
23 The enemy shall not be able to do him violence; \* the son of
wickedness shall not hurt him.\
24 I will smite down his foes before his face, \* and plague them that
hate him.\
25 My truth also and my mercy shall be with him; \* and in my Name shall
his horn be exalted.\
26 I will set his dominion also in the sea, \* and his right hand in the
floods.\
27 He shall call me, Thou art my Father, \* my God, and my strong
salvation.\
28 And I will make him my firstborn, \* higher than the kings of the
earth.\
29 My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, \* and my covenant shall
stand fast with him.\
30 His seed also will I make to endure for ever, \* and his throne as
the days of heaven.\
31 But if his children forsake my law, \* and walk not in my judgments;\
32 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; \* I will
visit their offences with the rod, and their sin with scourges.\
33 Nevertheless, my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from him, \*
nor suffer my truth to fail.\
34 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of
my lips: \* I have sworn once by my holiness, that I will not fail
David.\
35 His seed shall endure for ever, \* and his throne is like as the sun
before me.\
36 He shall stand fast for evermore as the moon, \* and as the faithful
witness in heaven.\
37 But thou hast abhorred and forsaken thine anointed, \* and art
displeased at him.\
38 Thou hast broken the covenant of thy servant, \* and cast his crown
to the ground.\
39 Thou hast overthrown all his hedges, \* and broken down his
strongholds.\
40 All they that go by spoil him, \* and he is become a reproach to his
neighbours.\
41 Thou hast set up the right hand of his enemies, \* and made all his
adversaries to rejoice.\
42 Thou hast taken away the edge of his sword, \* and givest him not
victory in the battle.\
43 Thou hast put out his glory, \* and cast his throne down to the
ground.\
44 The days of his youth hast thou shortened, \* and covered him with
dishonour.\
45 LORD, how long wilt thou hide thyself? for ever? \* and shall thy
wrath burn like fire?\
46 O remember how short my time is; \* wherefore hast thou made all men
for nought?\
47 What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? \* and shall he
deliver his soul from the power of the grave?\
48 Lord, where are thy old loving-kindnesses, \* which thou swarest unto
David in thy truth?\
49 Remember, Lord, the rebuke that thy servants have, \* and how I do
bear in my bosom the rebukes of many people;\
50 Wherewith thine enemies have blasphemed thee, \* and slandered the
footsteps of thine anointed.\
51 Praised be the LORD for evermore. \* Amen, and Amen.
