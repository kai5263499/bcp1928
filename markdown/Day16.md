| **Psalm 79. Deus, venerunt.**\                                        |
| O GOD, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; \* thy holy       |
| temple have they defiled, and made Jerusalem an heap of stones.\      |
| 2 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the |
| fowls of the air, \* and the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of   |
| the land.\                                                            |
| 3 Their blood have they shed like water on every side of Jerusalem,   |
| \* and there was no man to bury them.\                                |
| 4 We are become an open shame to our enemies, \* a very scorn and     |
| derision unto them that are round about us.\                          |
| 5 LORD, how long wilt thou be angry? \* shall thy jealousy burn like  |
| fire for ever?\                                                       |
| 6 Pour out thine indignation upon the heathen that have not known     |
| thee; \* and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy Name.\   |
| 7 For they have devoured Jacob, \* and laid waste his                 |
| dwelling-place.\                                                      |
| 8 O remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and that soon; |
| \* for we are come to great misery.\                                  |
| 9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name: \* O    |
| deliver us, and be merciful unto our sins, for thy Name\'s sake.\     |
| 10 Wherefore do the heathen say, \* Where is now their God?\          |
| 11 O let the vengeance of thy servants\' blood that is shed, \* be    |
| openly showed upon the heathen, in our sight.\                        |
| 12 O let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before thee; \*  |
| according to the greatness of thy power, preserve thou those that are |
| appointed to die.\                                                    |
| 13 And for the blasphemy wherewith our neighbours have blasphemed     |
| thee, \* reward thou them, O Lord, sevenfold into their bosom.\       |
| 14 So we, that are thy people, and sheep of thy pasture, shall give   |
| thee thanks for ever, \* and will alway be showing forth thy praise   |

| Psalm 80. Qui regis Israel.**\                                        |
| HEAR, O thou Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a      |
| flock; \* show thyself also, thou that sittest upon the Cherubim.\    |
| 2 Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, \* stir up thy strength,    |
| and come and help us.\                                                |

| shall be whole.\                                                      |
| 4 O LORD God of hosts, \* how long wilt thou be angry with thy people |
| that prayeth?\                                                        |
| 5 Thou feedest them with the bread of tears, \* and givest them       |
| plenteousness of tears to drink.\                                     |
| 6 Thou hast made us a very strife unto our neighbours, \* and our     |
| enemies laugh us to scorn.\                                           |
| 7 Turn us again, thou God of hosts; \* show the light of thy          |
| countenance, and we shall be whole.\                                  |
| 8 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt; \* thou hast cast out the    |
| heathen, and planted it.\                                             |
| 9 Thou madest room for it; \* and when it had taken root, it filled   |
| the land.\                                                            |
| 10 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, \* and the boughs    |
| thereof were like the goodly cedar-trees.\                            |
| 11 She stretched out her branches unto the sea, \* and her boughs     |
| unto the River.\                                                      |
| 12 Why hast thou then broken down her hedge, \* that all they that go |
| by pluck off her grapes?\                                             |
| 13 The wild boar out of the wood doth root it up, \* and the wild     |
| beasts of the field devour it.\                                       |
| 14 Turn thee again, thou God of hosts, look down from heaven, \*      |
| behold, and visit this vine;\                                         |
| 15 And the place of the vineyard that thy right hand hath planted, \* |
| and the branch that thou madest so strong for thyself.\               |
| 16 It is burnt with fire, and cut down; \* and they shall perish at   |
| the rebuke of thy countenance.\                                       |
| 17 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, \* and upon the    |
| son of man, whom thou madest so strong for thine own self.\           |
| 18 And so will not we go back from thee: \* O let us live, and we     |
| shall call upon thy Name.\                                            |
| 19 Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts; \* show the light of thy       |

| 5 This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, \* when he came out of  |
| the land of Egypt, and had heard a strange language.\                 |
| 6 I eased his shoulder from the burden, \* and his hands were         |
| delivered from making the pots.\                                      |
| 7 Thou calledst upon me in troubles, and I delivered thee; \* and     |
| heard thee what time as the storm fell upon thee.\                    |
| 8 I proved thee also \* at the waters of strife.\                     |
| 9 Hear, O my people; and I will assure thee, O Israel, \* if thou     |
| wilt hearken unto me,\                                                |

| worship any other god.\                                               |
| 11 I am the LORD thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt:  |
| \* open thy mouth wide, and I shall fill it.\                         |
| 12 But my people would not hear my voice; \* and Israel would not     |
| obey me;\                                                             |
| 13 So I gave them up unto their own hearts\' lusts, \* and let them   |
| follow their own imaginations.\                                       |
| 14 O that my people would have hearkened unto me! \* for if Israel    |
| had walked in my ways,\                                               |
| 15 I should soon have put down their enemies, \* and turned my hand   |
| against their adversaries.\                                           |
| 16 The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him;  |
| \* but their time should have endured for ever.\                      |
| 17 I would have fed them also with the finest wheatflour; \* and with |
| honey out of the stony rock would I have satisfied thee.\             |

| thy ways.\                                                            |
| 6 Who going through the vale of misery use it for a well; \* and the  |
| pools are filled with water.\                                         |
| 7 They will go from strength to strength, \* and unto the God of gods |
| appeareth every one of them in Sion.\                                 |
| 8 O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; \* hearken, O God of Jacob.\   |
| 9 Behold, O God our defender, \* and look upon the face of thine      |
| anointed.\                                                            |
| 10 For one day in thy courts \* is better than a thousand.\           |
| 11 I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God, \* than to   |
| dwell in the tents of ungodliness.\                                   |
| 12 For the LORD God is a light and defence; \* the LORD will give     |
| grace and worship; and no good thing shall he withhold from them that |
| live a godly life.\                                                   |
| 13 O LORD God of hosts, \* blessed is the man that putteth his trust  |
| in thee.\                                                             |
| \                                                                     |
| **\                                                                   |
| Psalm 85. Benedixisti, Domine.**\                                     |
| LORD, thou art become gracious unto thy land; \* thou hast turned     |
| away the captivity of Jacob.\                                         |
| 2 Thou hast forgiven the offence of thy people, \* and covered all    |
| their sins.\                                                          |
| 3 Thou hast taken away all thy displeasure, \* and turned thyself     |
| from thy wrathful indignation.\                                       |
| 4 Turn us then, O God our Saviour, \* and let thine anger cease from  |
| us.\                                                                  |
| 5 Wilt thou be displeased at us for ever? \* and wilt thou stretch    |
| out thy wrath from one generation to another?\                        |
| 6 Wilt thou not turn again, and quicken us, \* that thy people may    |
| rejoice in thee?\                                                     |
| 7 Show us thy mercy, O LORD, \* and grant us thy salvation.\          |
| 8 I will hearken what the LORD God will say; \* for he shall speak    |
| peace unto his people, and to his saints, that they turn not again    |
| unto foolishness.\                                                    |
| 9 For his salvation is nigh them that fear him; \* that glory may     |
| dwell in our land.\                                                   |
| 10 Mercy and truth are met together: \* righteousness and peace have  |
| kissed each other.\                                                   |
| 11 Truth shall flourish out of the earth, \* and righteousness hath   |
| looked down from heaven.\                                             |
| 12 Yea, the LORD shall show loving-kindness; \* and our land shall    |
| give her increase.\                                                   |
| 13 Righteousness shall go before him, \* and shall direct his going   |
| in the way.                                                           |
|                                                                       |
