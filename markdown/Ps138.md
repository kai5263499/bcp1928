| **Psalm 138. Confitebor tibi.**\                                      |
| I WILL give thanks unto thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; \* even    |
| before the gods will I sing praise unto thee.\                        |
| 2 I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy Name, because |
| of thy loving-kindness and truth; \* for thou hast magnified thy      |
| Name, and thy word, above all things.\                                |
| 3 When I called upon thee, thou heardest me; \* and enduedst my soul  |
| with much strength.\                                                  |
| 4 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD; \* for they   |
| have heard the words of thy mouth.\                                   |
| 5 Yea, they shall sing of the ways of the LORD, \* that great is the  |
| glory of the LORD.\                                                   |
| 6 For though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly; \* |
| as for the proud, he beholdeth them afar off.\                        |
| 7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, yet shalt thou refresh me;   |
| \* thou shalt stretch forth thy hand upon the furiousness of mine     |
| enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.\                           |
| 8 The LORD shall make good his loving-kindness toward me; \* yea, thy |
| mercy, O LORD, endureth for ever; despise not then the works of thine |
| own hands.                                                            |
