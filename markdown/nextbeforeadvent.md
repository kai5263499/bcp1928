| 23 I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and    |
| the heavens, and they had no light.\                                  |
| 24 I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills  |
| moved lightly.\                                                       |
| 25 I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the      |
| heavens were fled.\                                                   |
| 26 I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all    |
| the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and  |
| by his fierce anger.\                                                 |
| 27 For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet |
| will I not make a full end.\                                          |
| 28 For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black:    |
| because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not repent,    |
| neither will I turn back from it.\                                    |
| 29 The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and        |
| bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks:     |
| every city shall be forsaken, and not a man dwell therein.\           |
| 30 And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest |
| thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of      |
| gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou  |
| make thyself fair; thy lovers will despise thee, they will seek thy   |

| 31 When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy      |

| 9 Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in |
| the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in    |
| the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God |
| will bring thee into judgment.\                                       |
| 10 Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy |
| flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.\                           |
| 1 Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil   |
| days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have   |
| no pleasure in them;\                                                 |

| 3 In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the     |
| strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they  |
| are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened,\         |
| 4 And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the   |
| grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and   |
| all the daughters of music shall be brought low;\                     |
| 5 Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears     |
| shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the      |
| grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man     |
| goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets:\       |
| 6 Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or |
| the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the     |
| cistern.\                                                             |

| his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.\                 |

| which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.\        |
| 10 We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve    |
| the tabernacle.\                                                      |
| 11 For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the    |
| sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.\   |
| 12 Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his   |
| own blood, suffered without the gate.\                                |

| sacrifices God is well pleased.\                                      |
| 17 Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for  |
| they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they  |
| may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for  |
| you.\                                                                 |

| shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord   |
| Jesus Christ.\                                                        |

| the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and  |
| in the water:\                                                        |

| with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.\  |
| 9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count     |
| slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any      |
| should perish, but that all should come to repentance.\               |

| 1 Surely vain are all men by nature, who are ignorant of God, and     |
| could not out of the good things that are seen know him that is:      |
| neither by considering the works did they acknowledge the             |
| workmaster;\                                                          |
| 2 But deemed either fire, or wind, or the swift air, or the circle of |
| the stars, or the violent water, or the lights of heaven, to be the   |
| gods which govern the world.\                                         |
| 3 With whose beauty if they being delighted took them to be gods; let |
| them know how much better the Lord of them is: for the first author   |
| of beauty hath created them.\                                         |
| 4 But if they were astonished at their power and virtue, let them     |
| understand by them, how much mightier he is that made them.\          |
| 5 For by the greatness and beauty of the creatures proportionably the |
| maker of them is seen.\                                               |
| 6 But yet for this they are the less to be blamed: for they           |
| peradventure err, seeking God, and desirous to find him.\             |
| 7 For being conversant in his works they search him diligently, and   |
| believe their sight: because the things are beautiful that are seen.\ |
| 8 Howbeit neither are they to be pardoned,\                           |
| 9 For if they were able to know so much, that they could aim at the   |
| world; how did they not sooner find out the Lord thereof?\            |
