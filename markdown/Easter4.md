| thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?\                   |

| grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of   |
| righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.\                 |

| not spoken also by us? And the LORD heard it.\                        |

| unto him in a dream.\                                                 |
| 7 My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.\     |
| 8 With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in   |
| dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold:        |
| wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?\ |

| and, behold, she was leprous.\                                        |
| 11 And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay not  |
| the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we have  |
| sinned.\                                                              |

| when he cometh out of his mother\'s womb.\                            |

| beseech thee.\                                                        |

| face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from  |
| the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in again.\    |
| 15 And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people   |

| 23 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the     |
| head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.\               |
| 24 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives   |
| be to their own husbands in every thing.\                             |
| 25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church,   |
| and gave himself for it;\                                             |
| 26 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by |

| 27 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having  |
| spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and   |
| without blemish.\                                                     |
| 28 So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that      |
| loveth his wife loveth himself.\                                      |
| 29 For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and        |
| cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:\                          |
| 30 For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.\   |
| 31 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall  |
| be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.\            |
| 32 This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the     |
| church.\                                                              |

| even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.\    |

| me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs    |
| which I have shown among them?\                                       |
| 12 I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and    |
| will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.\           |
| 13 And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it,    |
| (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)\   |
| 14 And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they    |
| have heard that thou LORD art among this people, that thou LORD art   |
| seen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that    |
| thou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a  |
| pillar of fire by night.\                                             |
| 15 Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the        |
| nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,\        |
| 16 Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land   |
| which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the         |
| wilderness.\                                                          |

| []{#anchor611430}18 The LORD is longsuffering, and of great mercy,    |
| forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the    |
| guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto   |
| the third and fourth generation.\                                     |

| the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people,    |
| from Egypt even until now.\                                           |

| 21 But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the     |
| glory of the LORD.\                                                   |

| which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now   |
| these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;\                 |
| 23 Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their        |
| fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:\          |
| 24 But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and  |
| hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he   |
| went; and his seed shall possess it.\                                 |
