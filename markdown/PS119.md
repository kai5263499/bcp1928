| 167 My soul hath kept thy testimonies, \* and loved them              |
| exceedingly.\                                                         |
| 168 I have kept thy commandments and testimonies; \* for all my ways  |

| XXII. Appropinquet deprecatio.\                                       |
| LET my complaint come before thee, O LORD; \* give me understanding   |
| according to thy word.\                                               |

| 171 My lips shall speak of thy praise, \* when thou hast taught me    |
| thy statutes.\                                                        |
| 172 Yea, my tongue shall sing of thy word; \* for all thy             |
| commandments are righteous.\                                          |
| 173 Let thine hand help me; \* for I have chosen thy commandments.\   |
| 174 I have longed for thy saving health, O LORD; \* and in thy law is |
| my delight.\                                                          |
| 175 O let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; \* and thy          |

| 176 I have gone astray like a sheep that is lost; \* O seek thy       |
| servant, for I do not forget thy commandments.                        |
