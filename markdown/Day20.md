| **Psalm 102. Domine, exaudi.**\                                       |
| HEAR my prayer, O LORD, \* and let my crying come unto thee.\         |
| 2 Hide not thy face from me in the time of my trouble; \* incline     |
| thine ear unto me when I call; O hear me, and that right soon.\       |
| 3 For my days are consumed away like smoke, \* and my bones are burnt |
| up as it were a firebrand.\                                           |
| 4 My heart is smitten down, and withered like grass; \* so that I     |
| forget to eat my bread.\                                              |
| 5 For the voice of my groaning, \* my bones will scarce cleave to my  |
| flesh.\                                                               |
| 6 I am become like a pelican in the wilderness, \* and like an owl    |
| that is in the desert.\                                               |
| 7 I have watched, and am even as it were a sparrow, \* that sitteth   |
| alone upon the housetop.\                                             |
| 8 Mine enemies revile me all the day long; \* and they that are mad   |
| upon me are sworn together against me.\                               |
| 9 For I have eaten ashes as it were bread, \* and mingled my drink    |
| with weeping;\                                                        |
| 10 And that, because of thine indignation and wrath; \* for thou hast |
| taken me up, and cast me down.\                                       |
| 11 My days are gone like a shadow, \* and I am withered like grass.\  |
| 12 But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever, \* and thy remembrance    |
| throughout all generations.\                                          |
| 13 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Sion; \* for it is time that |
| thou have mercy upon her, yea, the time is come.\                     |
| 14 And why? thy servants think upon her stones, \* and it pitieth     |
| them to see her in the dust.\                                         |
| 15 The nations shall fear thy Name, O LORD; \* and all the kings of   |
| the earth thy majesty;\                                               |
| 16 When the LORD shall build up Sion, \* and when his glory shall     |
| appear;\                                                              |
| 17 When he turneth him unto the prayer of the poor destitute, \* and  |
| despiseth not their desire.\                                          |
| 18 This shall be written for those that come after, \* and the people |
| which shall be born shall praise the LORD.\                           |
| 19 For he hath looked down from his sanctuary; \* out of the heaven   |
| did the LORD behold the earth;\                                       |
| 20 That he might hear the mournings of such as are in captivity, \*   |
| and deliver them that are appointed unto death;\                      |
| 21 That they may declare the Name of the LORD in Sion, \* and his     |
| worship at Jerusalem;\                                                |
| 22 When the peoples are gathered together, \* and the kingdoms also,  |
| to serve the LORD.\                                                   |
| 23 He brought down my strength in my journey, \* and shortened my     |
| days.\                                                                |
| 24 But I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of mine age;   |
| \* as for thy years, they endure throughout all generations.\         |
| 25 Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the       |
| earth, \* and the heavens are the work of thy hands.\                 |
| 26 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: \* they all shall wax    |
| old as doth a garment;\                                               |
| 27 And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be         |
| changed; \* but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.\     |
| 28 The children of thy servants shall continue, \* and their seed     |
| shall stand fast in thy sight.\                                       |
| \                                                                     |

| Psalm 103. Benedic, anima mea.**\                                     |
| PRAISE the LORD, O my soul; \* and all that is within me, praise his  |
| holy Name.\                                                           |
| 2 Praise the LORD, O my soul, \* and forget not all his benefits:\    |
| 3 Who forgiveth all thy sin, \* and healeth all thine infirmities;\   |
| 4 Who saveth thy life from destruction, \* and crowneth thee with     |
| mercy and loving-kindness;\                                           |
| 5 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things, \* making thee young and |
| lusty as an eagle.\                                                   |
| 6 The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment \* for all them that  |
| are oppressed with wrong.\                                            |
| 7 He showed his ways unto Moses, \* his works unto the children of    |
| Israel.\                                                              |
| 8 The LORD is full of compassion and mercy, \* longsuffering, and of  |
| great goodness.\                                                      |
| 9 He will not alway be chiding; \* neither keepeth he his anger for   |
| ever.\                                                                |
| 10 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; \* nor rewarded us       |
| according to our wickednesses.\                                       |
| 11 For look how high the heaven is in comparison of the earth; \* so  |
| great is his mercy also toward them that fear him.\                   |
| 12 Look how wide also the east is from the west; \* so far hath he    |
| set our sins from us.\                                                |
| 13 Yea, like as a father pitieth his own children; \* even so is the  |
| LORD merciful unto them that fear him.\                               |
| 14 For he knoweth whereof we are made; \* he remembereth that we are  |
| but dust.\                                                            |
| 15 The days of man are but as grass; \* for he flourisheth as a       |
| flower of the field.\                                                 |
| 16 For as soon as the wind goeth over it, it is gone; \* and the      |
| place thereof shall know it no more.\                                 |
| 17 But the merciful goodness of the LORD endureth for ever and ever   |
| upon them that fear him; \* and his righteousness upon children\'s    |
| children;\                                                            |
| 18 Even upon such as keep his covenant, \* and think upon his         |
| commandments to do them.\                                             |
| 19 The LORD hath prepared his seat in heaven, \* and his kingdom      |
| ruleth over all.\                                                     |
| 20 O praise the LORD, ye angels of his, ye that excel in strength; \* |
| ye that fulfil his commandment, and hearken unto the voice of his     |
| word.\                                                                |
| 21 O praise the LORD, all ye his hosts; \* ye servants of his that do |
| his pleasure.\                                                        |
| 22 O speak good of the LORD, all ye works of his, in all places of    |
| his dominion: \* praise thou the LORD, O my soul.\                    |

| **Psalm 104. Benedic, anima mea.**\                                   |
| PRAISE the LORD, O my soul: \* O LORD my God, thou art become         |
| exceeding glorious; thou art clothed with majesty and honour.\        |
| 2 Thou deckest thyself with light as it were with a garment, \* and   |
| spreadest out the heavens like a curtain.\                            |
| 3 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters, \* and maketh   |
| the clouds his chariot, and walketh upon the wings of the wind.\      |
| 4 He maketh his angels winds, \* and his ministers a flaming fire.\   |
| 5 He laid the foundations of the earth, \* that it never should move  |
| at any time.\                                                         |
| 6 Thou coveredst it with the deep like as with a garment; \* the      |
| waters stand above the hills.\                                        |
| 7 At thy rebuke they flee; \* at the voice of thy thunder they haste  |
| away.\                                                                |
| 8 They go up as high as the hills, and down to the valleys beneath;   |
| \* even unto the place which thou hast appointed for them.\           |
| 9 Thou hast set them their bounds, which they shall not pass, \*      |
| neither turn again to cover the earth.\                               |
| 10 He sendeth the springs into the rivers, \* which run among the     |
| hills.\                                                               |
| 11 All beasts of the field drink thereof, \* and the wild asses       |
| quench their thirst.\                                                 |
| 12 Beside them shall the fowls of the air have their habitation, \*   |
| and sing among the branches.\                                         |
| 13 He watereth the hills from above; \* the earth is filled with the  |
| fruit of thy works.\                                                  |
| 14 He bringeth forth grass for the cattle, \* and green herb for the  |
| service of men;\                                                      |
| 15 That he may bring food out of the earth, and wine that maketh glad |
| the heart of man; \* and oil to make him a cheerful countenance, and  |
| bread to strengthen man\'s heart.\                                    |
| 16 The trees of the LORD also are full of sap; \* even the cedars of  |
| Lebanon which he hath planted;\                                       |
| 17 Wherein the birds make their nests; \* and the firtrees are a      |
| dwelling for the stork.\                                              |
| 18 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; \* and so are the  |
| stony rocks for the conies.\                                          |
| 19 He appointed the moon for certain seasons, \* and the sun knoweth  |
| his going down.\                                                      |
| 20 Thou makest darkness that it may be night; \* wherein all the      |
| beasts of the forest do move.\                                        |
| 21 The lions, roaring after their prey, \* do seek their meat from    |
| God.\                                                                 |
| 22 The sun ariseth, and they get them away together, \* and lay them  |
| down in their dens.\                                                  |
| 23 Man goeth forth to his work, and to his labour, \* until the       |
| evening.\                                                             |
| 24 O LORD, how manifold are thy works! \* in wisdom hast thou made    |
| them all; the earth is full of thy riches.\                           |
| 25 So is the great and wide sea also; \* wherein are things creeping  |
| innumerable, both small and great beasts.\                            |
| 26 There go the ships, and there is that leviathan, \* whom thou hast |
| made to take his pastime therein.\                                    |
| 27 These wait all upon thee, \* that thou mayest give them meat in    |
| due season.\                                                          |
| 28 When thou givest it them, they gather it; \* and when thou openest |
| thy hand, they are filled with good.\                                 |
| 29 When thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: \* when thou takest  |
| away their breath, they die, and are turned again to their dust.\     |
| 30 When thou lettest thy breath go forth, they shall be made; \* and  |
| thou shalt renew the face of the earth.\                              |
| 31 The glorious majesty of the LORD shall endure for ever; \* the     |
| LORD shall rejoice in his works.\                                     |
| 32 The earth shall tremble at the look of him; \* if he do but touch  |
| the hills, they shall smoke.\                                         |
| 33 I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live; \* I will praise my   |
| God while I have my being.\                                           |
| 34 And so shall my words please him: \* my joy shall be in the LORD.\ |
| 35 As for sinners, they shall be consumed out of the earth, \* and    |
| the ungodly shall come to an end.\                                    |
| 36 Praise thou the LORD, O my soul. \* Praise the LORD.\              |
