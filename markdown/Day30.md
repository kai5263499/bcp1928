| **Psalm 144. Benedictus Dominus.**\                                   |
| BLESSED be the LORD my strength, \* who teacheth my hands to war, and |
| my fingers to fight:\                                                 |
| 2 My hope and my fortress, my castle and deliverer, my defender in    |
| whom I trust; \* who subdueth my people that is under me.\            |
| 3 LORD, what is man, that thou hast such respect unto him? \* or the  |
| son of man, that thou so regardest him?\                              |
| 4 Man is like a thing of nought; \* his time passeth away like a      |
| shadow.\                                                              |
| 5 Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down; \* touch the mountains, and |
| they shall smoke.\                                                    |
| 6 Cast forth thy lightning, and tear them; \* shoot out thine arrows, |
| and consume them.\                                                    |
| 7 Send down thine hand from above; \* deliver me, and take me out of  |
| the great waters, from the hand of strangers;\                        |
| 8 Whose mouth talketh of vanity, \* and their right hand is a right   |
| hand of wickedness.\                                                  |
| 9 I will sing a new song unto thee, O God; \* and sing praises unto   |
| thee upon a ten-stringed lute.\                                       |
| 10 Thou hast given victory unto kings, \* and hast delivered David    |
| thy servant from the peril of the sword.\                             |
| 11 Save me, and deliver me from the hand of strangers, \* whose mouth |
| talketh of vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of iniquity:\ |
| 12 That our sons may grow up as the young plants, \* and that our     |
| daughters may be as the polished corners of the temple;\              |
| 13 That our garners may be full and plenteous with all manner of      |
| store; \* that our sheep may bring forth thousands, and ten thousands |
| in our fields;\                                                       |

| no leading into captivity, and no complaining in our streets.\        |
| 15 Happy are the people that are in such a case; \* yea, blessed are  |
| the people who have the LORD for their God.\                          |

| ever and ever.\                                                       |
| 3 Great is the LORD, and marvellous worthy to be praised; \* there is |
| no end of his greatness.\                                             |
| 4 One generation shall praise thy works unto another, \* and declare  |
| thy power.\                                                           |
| 5 As for me, I will be talking of thy worship, \* thy glory, thy      |
| praise, and wondrous works;\                                          |
| 6 So that men shall speak of the might of thy marvellous acts; \* and |
| I will also tell of thy greatness.\                                   |
| 7 The memorial of thine abundant kindness shall be showed; \* and men |
| shall sing of thy righteousness.\                                     |
| 8 The LORD is gracious and merciful; \* long-suffering, and of great  |
| goodness.\                                                            |
| 9 The LORD is loving unto every man; \* and his mercy is over all his |
| works.\                                                               |
| 10 All thy works praise thee, O LORD; \* and thy saints give thanks   |
| unto thee.\                                                           |
| 11 They show the glory of thy kingdom, \* and talk of thy power;\     |
| 12 That thy power, thy glory, and mightiness of thy kingdom, \* might |
| be known unto men.\                                                   |
| 13 Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, \* and thy dominion         |
| endureth throughout all ages.\                                        |
| 14 The LORD upholdeth all such as fall, \* and lifteth up all those   |
| that are down.\                                                       |
| 15 The eyes of all wait upon thee, O Lord; \* and thou givest them    |
| their meat in due season.\                                            |
| 16 Thou openest thine hand, \* and fillest all things living with     |
| plenteousness.\                                                       |

| 18 The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him; \* yea, all     |
| such as call upon him faithfully.\                                    |
| 19 He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him; \* he also will   |
| hear their cry, and will help them.\                                  |
| 20 The LORD preserveth all them that love him; \* but scattereth      |
| abroad all the ungodly.\                                              |

| Psalm 146. Lauda, anima mea.**\                                       |
| PRAISE the LORD, O my soul: while I live, will I praise the LORD; \*  |
| yea, as long as I have any being, I will sing praises unto my God.\   |
| 2 O put not your trust in princes, nor in any child of man; \* for    |
| there is no help in them.\                                            |
| 3 For when the breath of man goeth forth, he shall turn again to his  |

| 4 Blessed is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, \* and whose |

| righteous.\                                                           |
| 9 The LORD careth for the strangers; he defendeth the fatherless and  |
| widow: \* as for the way of the ungodly, he turneth it upside down.\  |
| 10 The LORD thy God, O Sion, shall be King for evermore, \* and       |
| throughout all generations.\                                          |

| harp unto our God:\                                                   |
| 8 Who covereth the heaven with clouds, and prepareth rain for the     |
| earth; \* and maketh the grass to grow upon the mountains, and herb   |
| for the use of men;\                                                  |

| 12 Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; \* praise thy God, O Sion.\          |
| 13 For he hath made fast the bars of thy gates, \* and hath blessed   |
| thy children within thee.\                                            |
| 14 He maketh peace in thy borders, \* and filleth thee with the flour |
| of wheat.\                                                            |
| 15 He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth, \* and his word       |
| runneth very swiftly.\                                                |

| 5 Let them praise the Name of the LORD: \* for he spake the word, and |
| they were made; he commanded, and they were created.\                 |
| 6 He hath made them fast for ever and ever: \* he hath given them a   |
| law which shall not be broken.\                                       |
| 7 Praise the LORD from the earth, \* ye dragons and all deeps;\       |
