| **Psalm 105. Confitemini Domino.**\                                   |
| GIVE thanks unto the LORD, and call upon his Name; \* tell the people |
| what things he hath done.\                                            |
| 2 O let your songs be of him, and praise him; \* and let your talking |
| be of all his wondrous works.\                                        |
| 3 Rejoice in his holy Name; \* let the heart of them rejoice that     |
| seek the LORD.\                                                       |
| 4 Seek the LORD and his strength; \* seek his face evermore.\         |
| 5 Remember the marvellous works that he hath done; \* his wonders,    |
| and the judgments of his mouth;\                                      |
| 6 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, \* ye children of Jacob his       |
| chosen.\                                                              |
| 7 He is the LORD our God; \* his judgments are in all the world.\     |
| 8 He hath been alway mindful of his covenant and promise, \* that he  |
| made to a thousand generations;\                                      |
| 9 Even the covenant that he made with Abraham; \* and the oath that   |
| he sware unto Isaac;\                                                 |
| 10 And appointed the same unto Jacob for a law, \* and to Israel for  |
| an everlasting testament;\                                            |
| 11 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, \* the lot of    |
| your inheritance:\                                                    |
| 12 When there were yet but a few of them, \* and they strangers in    |
| the land;\                                                            |
| 13 What time as they went from one nation to another, \* from one     |
| kingdom to another people;\                                           |
| 14 He suffered no man to do them wrong, \* but reproved even kings    |
| for their sakes;\                                                     |
| 15 Touch not mine anointed, \* and do my prophets no harm.\           |
| 16 Moreover, he called for a dearth upon the land, \* and destroyed   |
| all the provision of bread.\                                          |
| 17 But he had sent a man before them, \* even Joseph, who was sold to |
| be a bond-servant;\                                                   |
| 18 Whose feet they hurt in the stocks; \* the iron entered into his   |
| soul;\                                                                |
| 19 Until the time came that his cause was known: \* the word of the   |
| LORD tried him.\                                                      |
| 20 The king sent, and delivered him; \* the prince of the people let  |
| him go free.\                                                         |
| 21 He made him lord also of his house, \* and ruler of all his        |
| substance;\                                                           |
| 22 That he might inform his princes after his will, \* and teach his  |
| senators wisdom.\                                                     |
| 23 Israel also came into Egypt, \* and Jacob was a stranger in the    |
| land of Ham.\                                                         |
| 24 And he increased his people exceedingly, \* and made them stronger |
| than their enemies;\                                                  |
| 25 Whose heart turned so, that they hated his people, \* and dealt    |
| untruly with his servants.\                                           |
| 26 Then sent he Moses his servant, \* and Aaron whom he had chosen.\  |
| 27 And these showed his tokens among them, \* and wonders in the land |
| of Ham.\                                                              |
| 28 He sent darkness, and it was dark; \* and they were not obedient   |
| unto his word.\                                                       |
| 29 He turned their waters into blood, \* and slew their fish.\        |
| 30 Their land brought forth frogs; \* yea, even in their kings\'      |
| chambers.\                                                            |
| 31 He spake the word, and there came all manner of flies, \* and lice |
| in all their quarters.\                                               |
| 32 He gave them hailstones for rain; \* and flames of fire in their   |
| land.\                                                                |
| 33 He smote their vines also and fig-trees; \* and destroyed the      |
| trees that were in their coasts.\                                     |
| 34 He spake the word, and the grasshoppers came, and caterpillars     |
| innumerable, \* and did eat up all the grass in their land, and       |
| devoured the fruit of their ground.\                                  |
| 35 He smote all the firstborn in their land; \* even the chief of all |
| their strength.\                                                      |
| 36 He brought them forth also with silver and gold; \* there was not  |
| one feeble person among their tribes.\                                |
| 37 Egypt was glad at their departing; \* for they were afraid of      |
| them.\                                                                |
| 38 He spread out a cloud to be a covering, \* and fire to give light  |
| in the night season.\                                                 |
| 39 At their desire he brought quails; \* and he filled them with the  |
| bread of heaven.\                                                     |
| 40 He opened the rock of stone, and the waters flowed out, \* so that |
| rivers ran in the dry places.\                                        |
| 41 For why? he remembered his holy promise; \* and Abraham his        |
| servant.\                                                             |
| 42 And he brought forth his people with joy, \* and his chosen with   |
| gladness;\                                                            |
| 43 And gave them the lands of the heathen; \* and they took the       |
| labours of the people in possession;\                                 |
| 44 That they might keep his statutes, \* and observe his laws.\       |
|                                                                       |
| []{#anchor461909}Evening Prayer.                                      |
|                                                                       |
| **Psalm 106. Confitemini Domino.**\                                   |
| O GIVE thanks unto the LORD; for he is gracious, \* and his mercy     |
| endureth for ever.\                                                   |
| 2 Who can express the noble acts of the LORD, \* or show forth all    |
| his praise?\                                                          |
| 3 Blessed are they that alway keep judgment, \* and do                |
| righteousness.\                                                       |
| 4 Remember me, O LORD, according to the favour that thou bearest unto |
| thy people; \* O visit me with thy salvation;\                        |
| 5 That I may see the felicity of thy chosen, \* and rejoice in the    |
| gladness of thy people, and give thanks with thine inheritance.\      |
| 6 We have sinned with our fathers; \* we have done amiss, and dealt   |
| wickedly.\                                                            |
| 7 Our fathers regarded not thy wonders in Egypt, neither kept they    |
| thy great goodness in remembrance; \* but were disobedient at the     |
| sea, even at the Red Sea.\                                            |
| 8 Nevertheless, he helped them for his Name\'s sake, \* that he might |
| make his power to be known.\                                          |
| 9 He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up; \* so he led them |
| through the deep, as through a wilderness.\                           |
| 10 And he saved them from the adversary\'s hand, \* and delivered     |
| them from the hand of the enemy.\                                     |
| 11 As for those that troubled them, the waters overwhelmed them; \*   |
| there was not one of them left.\                                      |
| 12 Then believed they his words, \* and sang praise unto him.\        |
| 13 But within a while they forgat his works, \* and would not abide   |
| his counsel.\                                                         |
| 14 But lust came upon them in the wilderness, \* and they tempted God |
| in the desert.\                                                       |
| 15 And he gave them their desire, \* and sent leanness withal into    |
| their soul.\                                                          |
| 16 They angered Moses also in the tents, \* and Aaron the saint of    |
| the LORD.\                                                            |
| 17 So the earth opened, and swallowed up Dathan, \* and covered the   |
| congregation of Abiram.\                                              |
| 18 And the fire was kindled in their company; \* the flame burnt up   |
| the ungodly.\                                                         |
| 19 They made a calf in Horeb, \* and worshipped the molten image.\    |
| 20 Thus they turned their glory \* into the similitude of a calf that |
| eateth hay.\                                                          |
| 21 And they forgat God their Saviour, \* who had done so great things |
| in Egypt;\                                                            |
| 22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham; \* and fearful things by the    |
| Red Sea.\                                                             |
| 23 So he said he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his chosen  |
| stood before him in the gap, \* to turn away his wrathful             |
| indignation, lest he should destroy them.\                            |
| 24 Yea, they thought scorn of that pleasant land, \* and gave no      |
| credence unto his word;\                                              |
| 25 But murmured in their tents, \* and hearkened not unto the voice   |
| of the LORD.\                                                         |
| 26 Then lift he up his hand against them, \* to overthrow them in the |
| wilderness;\                                                          |
| 27 To cast out their seed among the nations, \* and to scatter them   |
| in the lands.\                                                        |
| 28 They joined themselves unto Baal-peor, \* and ate the offerings of |
| the dead.\                                                            |
| 29 Thus they provoked him to anger with their own inventions; \* and  |
| the plague was great among them.\                                     |
| 30 Then stood up Phinehas, and interposed; \* and so the plague       |
| ceased.\                                                              |
| 31 And that was counted unto him for righteousness, \* among all      |
| posterities for evermore.\                                            |
| 32 They angered him also at the waters of strife, \* so that he       |
| punished Moses for their sakes;\                                      |
| 33 Because they provoked his spirit, \* so that he spake unadvisedly  |
| with his lips.\                                                       |
| 34 Neither destroyed they the heathen, \* as the LORD commanded       |
| them;\                                                                |
| 35 But were mingled among the heathen, \* and learned their works.\   |
| 36 Insomuch that they worshipped their idols, which became a snare    |
| unto them; \* yea, they offered their sons and their daughters unto   |
| devils;\                                                              |
| 37 And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their |
| daughters, \* whom they offered unto the idols of Canaan; and the     |
| land was defiled with blood.\                                         |
| 38 Thus were they stained with their own works, \* and went a whoring |
| with their own inventions.\                                           |
| 39 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, \* |
| insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.\                       |
| 40 And he gave them over into the hand of the heathen; \* and they    |
| that hated them were lords over them.\                                |
| 41 Their enemies oppressed them, \* and had them in subjection.\      |
| 42 Many a time did he deliver them; \* but they rebelled against him  |
| with their own inventions, and were brought down in their             |
| wickedness.\                                                          |
| 43 Nevertheless, when he saw their adversity, \* he heard their       |
| complaint.\                                                           |
| 44 He thought upon his covenant, and pitied them, according unto the  |
| multitude of his mercies; \* yea, he made all those that led them     |
| away captive to pity them.\                                           |
| 45 Deliver us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen;  |
| \* that we may give thanks unto thy holy Name, and make our boast of  |
| thy praise.\                                                          |
| 46 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, from everlasting, and world     |
| without end; \* And let all the people say, Amen.\                    |
