| ALMIGHTY God, who didst give such grace unto thy holy Apostle Saint   |
| Andrew, that he readily obeyed the calling of thy Son Jesus Christ,   |
| and followed him without delay; Grant unto us all, that we, being     |
| called by thy holy Word, may forthwith give up ourselves obediently   |
| to fulfil thy holy commandments; through the same Jesus Christ our    |
| Lord. Amen.\                                                          |
|                                                                       |
| The Epistle. Romans x. 9.                                             |
|                                                                       |
| IF thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt        |
| believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou   |
| shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness;  |
| and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the         |
| scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. For |
| there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same    |
| Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever      |
| shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. How then shall   |
| they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they   |
| believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear   |
| without a preacher? and how shall they preach, except they be sent?   |
| as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the  |
| gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things ! But they     |
| have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath      |
| believed our report? So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by  |
| the word of God. But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their    |
| sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the   |
| world. But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will      |
| provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish  |
| nation I will anger you. But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was    |
| found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that  |
| asked not after me. But to Israel he saith, All day long I have       |
| stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.\   |

| The Gospel. St. Matthew iv. 18.                                       |

| JESUS, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called  |
| Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they   |
| were fishers. And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you  |
| fishers of men. And they straightway left their nets, and followed    |
| him. And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the   |
| son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their    |
| father, mending their nets; and he called them. And they immediately  |
| left the ship and their father. and followed him.                     |
