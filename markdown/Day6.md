| **Psalm 30. Exaltabo te, Domine.**\                                   |
| I WILL magnify thee, O LORD; for thou hast set me up, \* and not made |
| my foes to triumph over me.\                                          |
| 2 O LORD my God, I cried unto thee; \* and thou hast healed me.\      |
| 3 Thou, LORD, hast brought my soul out of hell: \* thou hast kept my  |
| life, that I should not go down into the pit.\                        |
| 4 Sing praises unto the LORD, O ye saints of his; \* and give thanks  |
| unto him, for a remembrance of his holiness.\                         |
| 5 For his wrath endureth but the twinkling of an eye, and in his      |
| pleasure is life; \* heaviness may endure for a night, but joy cometh |
| in the morning.\                                                      |
| 6 And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be removed: \* thou,     |
| LORD, of thy goodness, hast made my hill so strong.\                  |
| 7 Thou didst turn thy face from me, \* and I was troubled.\           |
| 8 Then cried I unto thee, O LORD; \* and gat me to my LORD right      |
| humbly.\                                                              |
| 9 What profit is there in my blood, \* when I go down into the pit?\  |
| 10 Shall the dust give thanks unto thee? \* or shall it declare thy   |
| truth?\                                                               |
| 11 Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me; \* LORD, be thou my helper.\ |
| 12 Thou hast turned my heaviness into joy; \* thou hast put off my    |
| sackcloth, and girded me with gladness:\                              |
| 13 Therefore shall every good man sing of thy praise without ceasing. |
| \* O my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.\                  |
| \                                                                     |

| Psalm 31. In te, Domine, speravi.**\                                  |
| IN thee, O LORD, have I put my trust; let me never be put to          |
| confusion; \* deliver me in thy righteousness.\                       |
| 2 Bow down thine ear to me; \* make haste to deliver me.\             |
| 3 And be thou my strong rock, and house of defence, \* that thou      |
| mayest save me.\                                                      |
| 4 For thou art my strong rock, and my castle: \* be thou also my      |
| guide, and lead me for thy Name\'s sake.\                             |
| 5 Draw me out of the net that they have laid privily for me; \* for   |
| thou art my strength.\                                                |
| 6 Into thy hands I commend my spirit; \* for thou hast redeemed me, O |
| LORD, thou God of truth.\                                             |
| 7 I have hated them that hold of lying vanities, \* and my trust hath |
| been in the LORD.\                                                    |
| 8 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy; \* for thou hast           |
| considered my trouble, and hast known my soul in adversities.\        |
| 9 Thou hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy; \* but hast    |
| set my feet in a large room.\                                         |
| 10 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble, \* and mine eye   |
| is consumed for very heaviness; yea, my soul and my body.\            |
| 11 For my life is waxen old with heaviness, \* and my years with      |
| mourning.\                                                            |
| 12 My strength faileth me, because of mine iniquity, \* and my bones  |
| are consumed.\                                                        |
| 13 I became a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among   |
| my neighbours; \* and they of mine acquaintance were afraid of me;    |
| and they that did see me without, conveyed themselves from me.\       |
| 14 I am clean forgotten as a dead man out of mind; \* I am become     |
| like a broken vessel.\                                                |
| 15 For I have heard the blasphemy of the multitude, and fear is on    |
| every side; \* while they conspire together against me, and take      |
| their counsel to take away my life.\                                  |
| 16 But my hope hath been in thee, O LORD; \* I have said, Thou art my |
| God.\                                                                 |
| 17 My times are in thy hand; deliver me from the hand of mine         |
| enemies, \* and from them that persecute me.\                         |
| 18 Show thy servant the light of thy countenance, \* and save me for  |
| thy mercy\'s sake.\                                                   |
| 19 Let me not be confounded, O LORD, for I have called upon thee; \*  |
| let the ungodly be put to confusion, and be put to silence in the     |
| grave.\                                                               |
| 20 Let the lying lips be put to silence, \* which cruelly,            |
| disdainfully, and despitefully speak against the righteous.\          |
| 21 O how plentiful is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them  |
| that fear thee, \* and that thou hast prepared for them that put      |
| their trust in thee, even before the sons of men!\                    |
| 22 Thou shalt hide them in the covert of thine own presence from the  |
| plottings of men: \* thou shalt keep them secretly in thy tabernacle  |
| from the strife of tongues.\                                          |
| 23 Thanks be to the LORD; \* for he hath showed me marvellous great   |
| kindness in a strong city.\                                           |
| 24 But in my haste I said, \* I am cast out of the sight of thine     |
| eyes.\                                                                |
| 25 Nevertheless, thou heardest the voice of my prayer, \* when I      |
| cried unto thee.\                                                     |
| 26 O love the LORD, all ye his saints; \* for the LORD preserveth     |
| them that are faithful, and plenteously rewardeth the proud doer.\    |
| 27 Be strong, and he shall establish your heart, \* all ye that put   |
| your trust in the LORD.\                                              |
|                                                                       |
| []{#anchor489896}Evening Prayer.                                      |
|                                                                       |
| **Psalm 32. Beati quorum.**\                                          |
| BLESSED is he whose unrighteousness is forgiven, \* and whose sin is  |
| covered.\                                                             |
| 2 Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth no sin, \* and in    |
| whose spirit there is no guile.\                                      |
| 3 For whilst I held my tongue, \* my bones consumed away through my   |
| daily complaining.\                                                   |
| 4 For thy hand was heavy upon me day and night, \* and my moisture    |
| was like the drought in summer.\                                      |
| 5 I acknowledged my sin unto thee; \* and mine unrighteousness have I |
| not hid.\                                                             |
| 6 I said, I will confess my sins unto the LORD; \* and SO thou        |
| forgavest the wickedness of my sin.\                                  |
| 7 For this shall every one that is godly make his prayer unto thee,   |
| in a time when thou mayest be found; \* surely the great water-floods |
| shall not come nigh him.\                                             |
| 8 Thou art a place to hide me in; thou shalt preserve me from         |
| trouble; \* thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance.\   |
| 9 I will inform thee, and teach thee in the way wherein thou shalt    |
| go; \* and I will guide thee with mine eye.\                          |
| 10 Be ye not like to horse and mule, which have no understanding; \*  |
| whose mouths must be held with bit and bridle, else they will not     |
| obey thee.\                                                           |
| 11 Great plagues remain for the ungodly; \* but whoso putteth his     |
| trust in the LORD, mercy embraceth him on every side.\                |
| 12 Be glad, O ye righteous, and rejoice in the LORD; \* and be        |
| joyful, all ye that are true of heart.\                               |
| \                                                                     |
| **\                                                                   |
| Psalm 33. Exultate, justi.**\                                         |
| REJOICE in the LORD, O ye righteous; \* for it becometh well the just |
| to be thankful.\                                                      |
| 2 Praise the LORD with harp; \* sing praises unto him with the lute,  |
| and instrument of ten strings.\                                       |
| 3 Sing unto the Lord a new song; \* sing praises lustily unto him     |
| with a good courage.\                                                 |
| 4 For the word of the LORD is true; \* and all his works are          |
| faithful.\                                                            |
| 5 He loveth righteousness and judgment; \* the earth is full of the   |
| goodness of the LORD.\                                                |
| 6 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; \* and all the host  |
| of them by the breath of his mouth.\                                  |
| 7 He gathereth the waters of the sea together, as it were upon an     |
| heap; \* and layeth up the deep, as in a treasure-house.\             |
| 8 Let all the earth fear the LORD: \* stand in awe of him, all ye     |
| that dwell in the world.\                                             |
| 9 For he spake, and it was done; \* he commanded, and it stood fast.\ |
| 10 The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought, \* and     |
| maketh the devices of the people to be of none effect, and casteth    |
| out the counsels of princes.\                                         |
| 11 The counsel of the LORD shall endure for ever, \* and the thoughts |
| of his heart from generation to generation.\                          |
| 12 Blessed are the people whose God is the Lord JEHOVAH; \* and       |
| blessed are the folk that he hath chosen to him, to be his            |
| inheritance.\                                                         |
| 13 The LORD looketh down from heaven, and beholdeth all the children  |
| of men; \* from the habitation of his dwelling, he considereth all    |
| them that dwell on the earth.\                                        |
| 14 He fashioneth all the hearts of them, \* and understandeth all     |
| their works.\                                                         |
| 15 There is no king that can be saved by the multitude of an host; \* |
| neither is any mighty man delivered by much strength.\                |
| 16 A horse is counted but a vain thing to save a man; \* neither      |
| shall he deliver any man by his great strength.\                      |
| 17 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, \* and     |
| upon them that put their trust in his mercy;\                         |
| 18 To deliver their soul from death, \* and to feed them in the time  |
| of dearth.\                                                           |
| 19 Our soul hath patiently tarried for the LORD; \* for he is our     |
| help and our shield.\                                                 |
| 20 For our heart shall rejoice in him; \* because we have hoped in    |
| his holy Name.\                                                       |
| 21 Let thy merciful kindness, O LORD, be upon us, \* like as we do    |
| put our trust in thee.\                                               |
| \                                                                     |

| Psalm 34. Benedicam Dominum.**\                                       |
| I WILL alway give thanks unto the LORD; \* his praise shall ever be   |
| in my mouth.\                                                         |
| 2 My soul shall make her boast in the LORD; \* the humble shall hear  |
| thereof, and be glad.\                                                |
| 3 O praise the LORD with me, \* and let us magnify his Name           |
| together.\                                                            |
| 4 I sought the LORD, and he heard me; \* yea, he delivered me out of  |
| all my fear.\                                                         |
| 5 They had an eye unto him, and were lightened; \* and their faces    |
| were not ashamed.\                                                    |
| 6 Lo, the poor crieth, and the LORD heareth him; \* yea, and saveth   |
| him out of all his troubles.\                                         |
| 7 The angel of the LORD tarrieth round about them that fear him, \*   |
| and delivereth them.\                                                 |
| 8 O taste, and see, how gracious the LORD is: \* blessed is the man   |
| that trusteth in him.\                                                |
| 9 O fear the LORD, ye that are his saints; \* for they that fear him  |
| lack nothing.\                                                        |
| 10 The lions do lack, and suffer hunger; \* but they who seek the     |
| LORD shall want no manner of thing that is good.\                     |
| 11 Come, ye children, and hearken unto me; \* I will teach you the    |
| fear of the LORD.\                                                    |
| 12 What man is he that lusteth to live, \* and would fain see good    |
| days?\                                                                |
| 13 Keep thy tongue from evil, \* and thy lips, that they speak no     |
| guile.\                                                               |
| 14 Eschew evil, and do good; \* seek peace, and ensue it.\            |
| 15 The eyes of the LORD are over the righteous, \* and his ears are   |
| open unto their prayers.\                                             |
| 16 The countenance of the LORD is against them that do evil, \* to    |
| root out the remembrance of them from the earth.\                     |
| 17 The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth them, \* and delivereth    |
| them out of all their troubles.\                                      |
| 18 The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart, \* and    |
| will save such as be of an humble spirit.\                            |
| 19 Great are the troubles of the righteous; \* but the LORD           |
| delivereth him out of all.\                                           |
| 20 He keepeth all his bones, \* so that not one of them is broken.\   |
| 21 But misfortune shall slay the ungodly; \* and they that hate the   |
| righteous shall be desolate.\                                         |
| 22 The LORD delivereth the souls of his servants; \* and all they     |
| that put their trust in him shall not be destitute.                   |
|                                                                       |
