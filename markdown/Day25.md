| O THINK upon thy servant, as concerning thy word, \* wherein thou     |
| hast caused me to put my trust.\                                      |

| shrinked from thy law.\                                               |
| 52 For I remembered thine everlasting judgments, O LORD, \* and       |
| received comfort.\                                                    |
| 53 I am horribly afraid, \* for the ungodly that forsake thy law.\    |
| 54 Thy statutes have been my songs, \* in the house of my             |
| pilgrimage.\                                                          |
| 55 I have thought upon thy Name, O LORD, in the night season, \* and  |
| have kept thy law.\                                                   |
| 56 This I had, \* because I kept thy commandments.\                   |
| \                                                                     |
| \                                                                     |
| VIII. Portio mea, Domine.\                                            |
| THOU art my portion, O LORD; \* I have promised to keep thy law.\     |
| 58 I made my humble petition in thy presence with my whole heart; \*  |
| O be merciful unto me, according to thy word.\                        |
| 59 I called mine own ways to remembrance, \* and turned my feet unto  |
| thy testimonies.\                                                     |
| 60 I made haste, and prolonged not the time, \* to keep thy           |
| commandments.\                                                        |
| 61 The snares of the ungodly have compassed me about; \* but I have   |
| not forgotten thy law.\                                               |
| 62 At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee, \* because of    |
| thy righteous judgments.\                                             |
| 63 I am a companion of all them that fear thee, \* and keep thy       |
| commandments.\                                                        |
| 64 The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: \* O teach me thy         |
| statutes.\                                                            |

| IX. Bonitatem fecisti.\                                               |
| O LORD, thou hast dealt graciously with thy servant, \* according     |
| unto thy word.\                                                       |
| 66 O teach me true understanding and knowledge; \* for I have         |
| believed thy commandments.\                                           |
| 67 Before I was troubled, I went wrong; \* but now have I kept thy    |
| word.\                                                                |
| 68 Thou art good and gracious; \* O teach me thy statutes.\           |
| 69 The proud have imagined a lie against me; \* but I will keep thy   |
| commandments with my whole heart.\                                    |
| 70 Their heart is as fat as brawn; \* but my delight hath been in thy |
| law.\                                                                 |
| 71 It is good for me that I have been in trouble; \* that I may learn |
| thy statutes.\                                                        |
| 72 The law of thy mouth is dearer unto me \* than thousands of gold   |
| and silver.\                                                          |
|                                                                       |

| that I may learn thy commandments.\                                   |
| 74 They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; \* because I    |
| have put my trust in thy word.\                                       |
| 75 I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, \* and that thou of  |
| very faithfulness hast caused me to be troubled.\                     |
| 76 O let thy merciful kindness be my comfort, \* according to thy     |
| word unto thy servant.\                                               |
| 77 O let thy loving mercies come unto me, that I may live; \* for thy |
| law is my delight.\                                                   |
| 78 Let the proud be confounded, for they go wickedly about to destroy |
| me; \* but I will be occupied in thy commandments.\                   |
| 79 Let such as fear thee, and have known thy testimonies, \* be       |
| turned unto me.\                                                      |
| 80 O let my heart be sound in thy statutes, \* that I be not          |
| ashamed.\                                                             |

| 84 How many are the days of thy servant? \* when wilt thou be avenged |
| of them that persecute me?\                                           |
| 85 The proud have digged pits for me, \* which are not after thy      |

| in my trouble.\                                                       |
| 93 I will never forget thy commandments; \* for with them thou hast   |
| quickened me.\                                                        |
| 94 I am thine: O save me, \* for I have sought thy commandments.\     |
| 95 The ungodly laid wait for me, to destroy me; \* but I will         |
| consider thy testimonies.\                                            |
| 96 I see that all things come to an end; \* but thy commandment is    |

| 100 I am wiser than the aged; \* because I keep thy commandments.\    |
| 101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, \* that I may keep  |
| thy word.\                                                            |
| 102 I have not shrunk from thy judgments; \* for thou teachest me.\   |
| 103 O how sweet are thy words unto my throat; \* yea, sweeter than    |
| honey unto my mouth!\                                                 |
