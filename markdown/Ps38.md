| PSALM +\                                                              |
| \                                                                     |
|                                                                       |
| **Psalms 38. Domine, ne in furore.**\                                 |
| PUT me not to rebuke, O LORD, in thine anger; \* neither chasten me   |
| in thy heavy displeasure:\                                            |
| 2 For thine arrows stick fast in me, \* and thy hand presseth me      |
| sore.\                                                                |
| 3 There is no health in my flesh, because of thy displeasure; \*      |
| neither is there any rest in my bones, by reason of my sin.\          |
| 4 For my wickednesses are gone over my head, \* and are like a sore   |
| burden, too heavy for me to bear.\                                    |
| 5 My wounds stink, and are corrupt, \* through my foolishness.\       |
| 6 I am brought into so great trouble and misery, \* that I go         |
| mourning all the day long.\                                           |
| 7 For my loins are filled with a sore disease, \* and there is no     |
| whole part in my body.\                                               |
| 8 I am feeble and sore smitten; \* I have roared for the very         |
| disquietness of my heart.\                                            |
| 9 Lord, thou knowest all my desire; \* and my groaning is not hid     |
| from thee.\                                                           |
| 10 My heart panteth, my strength hath failed me, \* and the light of  |
| mine eyes is gone from me.\                                           |
| 11 My lovers and my neighbours did stand looking upon my trouble, \*  |
| and my kinsmen stood afar off.\                                       |
| 12 They also that sought after my life laid snares for me; \* and     |
| they that went about to do me evil talked of wickedness, and imagined |
| deceit all the day long.\                                             |
| 13 As for me, I was like a deaf man, and heard not; \* and as one     |
| that is dumb, who doth not open his mouth.\                           |
| 14 I became even as a man that heareth not, \* and in whose mouth are |
| no reproofs.\                                                         |
| 15 For in thee, O LORD, have I put my trust; \* thou shalt answer for |
| me, O Lord my God.\                                                   |
| 16 I have required that they, even mine enemies, should not triumph   |
| over me; \* for when my foot slipt, they rejoiced greatly against     |
| me.\                                                                  |
| 17 And I truly am set in the plague, \* and my heaviness is ever in   |
| my sight.\                                                            |
| 18 For I will confess my wickedness, \* and be sorry for my sin.\     |
| 19 But mine enemies live, and are mighty; \* and they that hate me    |
| wrongfully are many in number.\                                       |
| 20 They also that reward evil for good are against me; \* because I   |
| follow the thing that good is.\                                       |
| 21 Forsake me not, O LORD my God; \* be not thou far from me.         |
