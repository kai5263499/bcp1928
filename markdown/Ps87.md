| **Psalm 87. Fundamenta ejus.**\                                       |
| HER foundations are upon the holy hills: \* the LORD loveth the gates |
| of Sion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.\                        |
| 2 Very excellent things are spoken of thee, \* thou city of God.\     |
| 3 I will make mention of Egypt and Babylon, \* among them that know   |
| me.\                                                                  |
| 4 Behold, Philistia also; and Tyre, with Ethiopia; \* lo, in Sion     |
| were they born.\                                                      |
| 5 Yea, of Sion it shall be reported, this one and that one were born  |
| in her; \* and the Most High shall stablish her.\                     |
| 6 The LORD shall record it, when he writeth up the peoples; \* lo, in |
| Sion were they born.\                                                 |
| 7 The singers also and trumpeters shall make answer: \* All my fresh  |
| springs are in thee.                                                  |
