| **Psalm 56. Miserere mei, Deus.**\                                    |
| BE merciful unto me, O God, for man goeth about to devour me; \* he   |
| is daily fighting, and troubling me.\                                 |
| 2 Mine enemies are daily at hand to swallow me up; \* for they be     |
| many that fight against me, O thou Most Highest.\                     |
| 3 Nevertheless, though I am sometime afraid, \* yet put I my trust in |
| thee.\                                                                |
| 4 I will praise God, because of his word: \* I have put my trust in   |
| God, and will not fear what flesh can do unto me.\                    |
| 5 They daily mistake my words; \* all that they imagine is to do me   |
| evil.\                                                                |
| 6 They hold all together, and keep themselves close, \* and mark my   |
| steps, when they lay wait for my soul.\                               |
| 7 Shall they escape for their wickedness? \* thou, O God, in thy      |
| displeasure shalt cast them down.\                                    |
| 8 Thou tellest my wanderings; put my tears into thy bottle: \* are    |
| not these things noted in thy book?\                                  |
| 9 Whensoever I call upon thee, then shall mine enemies be put to      |
| flight: \* this I know; for God is on my side.\                       |
| 10 In God\'s word will I rejoice; \* in the LORD\'S word will I       |
| comfort me.\                                                          |
| 11 Yea, in God have I put my trust; \* I will not be afraid what man  |
| can do unto me.\                                                      |
| 12 Unto thee, O God, will I pay my vows; \* unto thee will I give     |
| thanks.\                                                              |
| 13 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, and my feet from       |
| falling, \* that I may walk before God in the light of the living.    |
