| \                                                                     |

| **Psalms 32. Beati quorum.**\                                         |
| BLESSED is he whose unrighteousness is forgiven, \* and whose sin is  |
| covered.\                                                             |
| 2 Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth no sin, \* and in    |
| whose spirit there is no guile.\                                      |
| 3 For whilst I held my tongue, \* my bones consumed away through my   |
| daily complaining.\                                                   |
| 4 For thy hand was heavy upon me day and night, \* and my moisture    |
| was like the drought in summer.\                                      |
| 5 I acknowledged my sin unto thee; \* and mine unrighteousness have I |
| not hid.\                                                             |
| 6 I said, I will confess my sins unto the LORD; \* and so thou        |
| forgavest the wickedness of my sin.\                                  |
| 7 For this shall every one that is godly make his prayer unto thee,   |
| in a time when thou mayest be found; \* surely the great water-floods |
| shall not come nigh him.\                                             |
| 8 Thou art a place to hide me in; thou shalt preserve me from         |
| trouble; \* thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance.\   |
| 9 I will inform thee, and teach thee in the way wherein thou shalt    |
| go; \* and I will guide thee with mine eye.\                          |
| 10 Be ye not like to horse and mule, which have no understanding; \*  |
| whose mouths must be held with bit and bridle, else they will not     |
| obey thee.\                                                           |
| 11 Great plagues remain for the ungodly; \* but whoso putteth his     |
| trust in the LORD, mercy embraceth him on every side.\                |
| 12 Be glad, O ye righteous, and rejoice in the LORD; \* and be        |
| joyful, all ye that are true of heart.                                |
