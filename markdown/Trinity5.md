| 17 And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good |

| impossible; but with God all things are possible.\                    |
| 27 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken    |
| all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?\                |
| 28 And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which     |
| have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit   |

| And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.\                              |

| all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of     |

| received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,\          |

| into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.\             |

| save them. And they went to another village.\                         |
| 57 And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man  |
| said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.\    |
| 58 And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air    |
| have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.\       |
| 59 And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me  |
| first to go and bury my father.\                                      |
| 60 Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and |
| preach the kingdom of God.\                                           |

| 1 Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, |
| the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a |
| one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.\   |
| 2 And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye     |
| down here. And they sat down.\                                        |
| 3 And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the  |
| country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our brother      |
| Elimelech\'s:\                                                        |
| 4 And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the          |
| inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem  |
| it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I   |
| may know: for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after  |
| thee. And he said, I will redeem it.\                                 |
| 5 Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of       |
| Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the   |
| dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.\         |
| 6 And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar     |
| mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot   |
| redeem it.\                                                           |
| 7 Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning         |

| called the month Casleu, in the hundred forty and eighth year, they   |
| rose up betimes in the morning,\                                      |

| 1 In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came      |
| Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.\      |
| 2 And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part  |
| of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of |
| Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the   |
| treasure house of his god.\                                           |
| 3 And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he |
| should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king\'s    |
| seed, and of the princes;\                                            |
| 4 Children in whom was no blemish, but wellfavoured, and skilful in   |
| all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and  |
| such as had ability in them to stand in the king\'s palace, and whom  |
| they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.\       |
| 5 And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king\'s meat,  |
| and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that  |
| at the end thereof they might stand before the king.\                 |
| 6 Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah,    |
| Mishael, and Azariah:\                                                |

| Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to |
| Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abed-nego.\                   |
| 17 As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in   |
| all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions  |
| and dreams.\                                                          |

| 21 After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when   |
| he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem,       |
| saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.\               |
| 22 So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him,    |
| Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.\   |
| 23 And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.\       |
| 24 For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made       |
| silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;\  |
| 25 Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and   |
| said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.\           |
| 26 Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost    |
| throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much    |
| people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:\      |
| 27 So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought;  |
| but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be         |
| despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and |
| the world worshippeth.\                                               |
| 28 And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and    |
| cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.\                  |
| 29 And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught    |
| Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul\'s companions in        |
| travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.\                |
| 30 And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples |
| suffered him not.\                                                    |
| 31 And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent     |
| unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the   |
| theatre.\                                                             |
| 32 Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly |
| was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come     |
| together.\                                                            |
| 33 And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him |
| forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made    |
| his defence unto the people.\                                         |
| 34 But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the |
| space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.\       |
| 35 And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of |
| Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the  |
| Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the      |
| image which fell down from Jupiter?\                                  |
| 36 Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought   |
| to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.\                               |
| 37 For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of |
| churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.\                       |
| 38 Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have |
| a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies:    |
| let them implead one another.\                                        |

| determined in a lawful assembly.\                                     |

| 1 Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of mount Ephraim,  |
| and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the   |
| son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:\                         |
| 2 And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name  |
| of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no   |
| children.\                                                            |
| 3 And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to       |
| sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli,  |
| Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.\            |
| 4 And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his |
| wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:\               |
| 5 But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but  |
| the LORD had shut up her womb.\                                       |
| 6 And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret,     |
| because the LORD had shut up her womb.\                               |
| 7 And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the |
| LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.\      |
| 8 Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and |
| why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to |
| thee than ten sons?\                                                  |
| 9 So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they    |
| had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple |
| of the LORD.\                                                         |

| wept sore.\                                                           |
| 11 And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt       |
| indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and |
| not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man    |
| child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life,   |

| This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign |
| be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.\                      |

| interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses    |
| shall be made a dunghill.\                                            |

| receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore show me   |
| the dream, and the interpretation thereof.\                           |
| 10 The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a   |

| Acts 20:1-16**\                                                       |
| 1 And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the           |
| disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.\ |
| 2 And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much      |
| exhortation, he came into Greece,\                                    |
| 3 And there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him,  |
| as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through     |
| Macedonia.\                                                           |
| 4 And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the    |
| Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and      |
| Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.\                      |
| 5 These going before tarried for us at Troas.\                        |
| 6 And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened       |
| bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven |
| days.\                                                                |
| 7 And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came         |
| together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on  |
| the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.\                 |
| 8 And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were    |
| gathered together.\                                                   |
| []{#anchor154428}9 And there sat in a window a certain young man      |
| named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long  |
| preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third      |
| loft, and was taken up dead.\                                         |
| 10 And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said,       |
| Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.\                      |
| 11 When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and     |
| eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he         |
| departed.\                                                            |
| 12 And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little        |
| comforted.\                                                           |
| 13 And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending |
| to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go       |
| afoot.\                                                               |
| 14 And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to      |
| Mitylene.\                                                            |
| 15 And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios;    |
| and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and  |
| the next day we came to Miletus.\                                     |
| 16 For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not   |
| spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him,   |
| to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.\                             |
