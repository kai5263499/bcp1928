| GOD be merciful unto us, and bless us, \* and show us the light of    |
| his countenance, and be merciful unto us;\                            |
| 2 That thy way may be known upon earth, \* thy saving health among    |
| all nations.\                                                         |
| 3 Let the peoples praise thee, O God; \* yea, let all the peoples     |
| praise thee.\                                                         |
| 4 O let the nations rejoice and be glad; \* for thou shalt judge the  |
| folk righteously, and govern the nations upon earth.\                 |
| 5 Let the peoples praise thee, O God; \* yea, let all the peoples     |
| praise thee.\                                                         |
| 6 Then shall the earth bring forth her increase; \* and God, even our |
| own God, shall give us his blessing.\                                 |
| 7 God shall bless us; \* and all the ends of the world shall fear     |
| him.                                                                  |
