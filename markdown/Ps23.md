| **Psalms 23. Dominus regit me.**\                                     |
| THE LORD is my shepherd; \* therefore can I lack nothing.\            |
| 2 He shall feed me in a green pasture, \* and lead me forth beside    |
| the waters of comfort.\                                               |
| 3 He shall convert my soul, \* and bring me forth in the paths of     |
| righteousness for his Name\'s sake.\                                  |
| 4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I     |
| will fear no evil; \* for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff     |
| comfort me.\                                                          |
| 5 Thou shalt prepare a table before me in the presence of them that   |
| trouble me; \* thou hast anointed my head with oil, and my cup shall  |
| be full.\                                                             |
| 6 Surely thy loving-kindness and mercy shall follow me all the days   |
| of my life; \* and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.    |
