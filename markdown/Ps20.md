| **Psalms 20. Exaudiat te Dominus.**\                                  |
| THE LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; \* the Name of the God of   |
| Jacob defend thee:\                                                   |
| 2 Send thee help from the sanctuary, \* and strengthen thee out of    |
| Sion:\                                                                |
| 3 Remember all thy offerings, \* and accept thy burnt-sacrifice:\     |
| 4 Grant thee thy heart\'s desire, \* and fulfil all thy mind.\        |
| 5 We will rejoice in thy salvation, and triumph in the Name of the    |
| Lord our God: \* the LORD perform all thy petitions.\                 |
| 6 Now know I that the LORD helpeth his anointed, and will hear him    |
| from his holy heaven, \* even with the wholesome strength of his      |
| right hand.\                                                          |
| 7 Some put their trust in chariots, and some in horses; \* but we     |
| will remember the Name of the LORD our God.\                          |
| 8 They are brought down and fallen; \* but we are risen and stand     |
| upright.\                                                             |
| 9 Save, LORD; and hear us, O King of heaven, \* when we call upon     |
| thee.                                                                 |
