| **Psalms 21. Domine, in virtute tua.**\                               |
| THE King shall rejoice in thy strength, O LORD; \* exceeding glad     |
| shall he be of thy salvation.\                                        |
| 2 Thou hast given him his heart\'s desire, \* and hast not denied him |
| the request of his lips.\                                             |
| 3 For thou shalt meet him with the blessings of goodness, \* and      |
| shalt set a crown of pure gold upon his head.\                        |
| 4 He asked life of thee; and thou gavest him a long life, \* even for |
| ever and ever.\                                                       |
| 5 His honour is great in thy salvation; \* glory and great worship    |
| shalt thou lay upon him.\                                             |
| 6 For thou shalt give him everlasting felicity, \* and make him glad  |
| with the joy of thy countenance.\                                     |
| 7 And why? because the King putteth his trust in the LORD; \* and in  |
| the mercy of the Most Highest he shall not miscarry.\                 |
| 8 All thine enemies shall feel thine hand; \* thy right hand shall    |
| find out them that hate thee.\                                        |
| 9 Thou shalt make them like a fiery oven in time of thy wrath: \* the |
| LORD shall destroy them in his displeasure, and the fire shall        |
| consume them.\                                                        |
| 10 Their fruit shalt thou root out of the earth, \* and their seed    |
| from among the children of men.\                                      |
| 11 For they intended mischief against thee, \* and imagined such a    |
| device as they are not able to perform.\                              |
| 12 Therefore shalt thou put them to flight, \* and the strings of thy |
| bow shalt thou make ready against the face of them.\                  |
| 13 Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength; \* so will we sing,  |
| and praise thy power.                                                 |
