| **Psalms 34. Benedicam Dominum.**\                                    |
| I WILL alway give thanks unto the LORD; \* his praise shall ever be   |
| in my mouth.\                                                         |
| 2 My soul shall make her boast in the LORD; \* the humble shall hear  |
| thereof, and be glad.\                                                |
| 3 O praise the LORD with me, \* and let us magnify his Name           |
| together.\                                                            |
| 4 I sought the LORD, and he heard me; \* yea, he delivered me out of  |
| all my fear.\                                                         |
| 5 They had an eye unto him, and were lightened; \* and their faces    |
| were not ashamed.\                                                    |
| 6 Lo, the poor crieth, and the LORD heareth him; \* yea, and saveth   |
| him out of all his troubles.\                                         |
| 7 The angel of the LORD tarrieth round about them that fear him, \*   |
| and delivereth them.\                                                 |
| 8 O taste, and see, how gracious the LORD is: \* blessed is the man   |
| that trusteth in him.\                                                |
| 9 O fear the LORD, ye that are his saints; \* for they that fear him  |
| lack nothing.\                                                        |
| 10 The lions do lack, and suffer hunger; \* but they who seek the     |
| LORD shall want no manner of thing that is good.\                     |
| 11 Come, ye children, and hearken unto me; \* I will teach you the    |
| fear of the LORD.\                                                    |
| 12 What man is he that lusteth to live, \* and would fain see good    |
| days?\                                                                |
| 13 Keep thy tongue from evil, \* and thy lips, that they speak no     |
| guile.\                                                               |
| 14 Eschew evil, and do good; \* seek peace, and ensue it.\            |
| 15 The eyes of the LORD are over the righteous, \* and his ears are   |
| open unto their prayers.\                                             |
| 16 The countenance of the LORD is against them that do evil, \* to    |
| root out the remembrance of them from the earth.\                     |
| 17 The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth them, \* and delivereth    |
| them out of all their troubles.\                                      |
| 18 The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart, \* and    |
| will save such as be of an humble spirit.\                            |
| 19 Great are the troubles of the righteous; \* but the LORD           |
| delivereth him out of all.\                                           |
| 20 He keepeth all his bones, \* so that not one of them is broken.\   |
| 21 But misfortune shall slay the ungodly; \* and they that hate the   |
| righteous shall be desolate.\                                         |
| 22 The LORD delivereth the souls of his servants; \* and all they     |
| that put their trust in him shall not be destitute.                   |
