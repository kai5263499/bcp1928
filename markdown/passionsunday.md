The Collect.

![](http://stats.superstats.com/b/ss/DAVIDMCMANNES/1){border="0"}

WE beseech thee, Almighty God, mercifully to look upon thy people; that
by thy great goodness they may be governed and preserved evermore, both
in body and soul; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\

The Epistle. Hebrews ix. 11.

CHRIST being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater
and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of
this building; neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own
blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal
redemption for us. For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes
of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the
flesh: how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal
Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from
dead works to serve the living God? And for this cause he is the
mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the
redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament,
they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.\

The Gospel. St. John viii. 46.

JESUS said, Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth,
why do ye not believe me? He that is of God heareth God\'s words: ye
therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God. Then answered the
Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and
hast a devil? Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my
Father, and ye do dishonour me. And I seek not mine own glory: there is
one that seeketh and judgeth. Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man
keep my saying, he shall never see death. Then said the Jews unto him,
Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets;
and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.
Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the
prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself? Jesus answered, If I honour
myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom
ye say, that he is your God: yet ye have not known him; but I know him:
and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you;
but I know him, and keep his saying. Your father Abraham rejoiced to see
my day: and he saw it, and was glad. Then said the Jews unto him, Thou
art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham? Jesus said unto
them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am. Then
took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out
of the temple.
