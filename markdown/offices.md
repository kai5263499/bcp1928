| Answer. My Sponsors did promise and vow three things in my name:      |
| First, that I should renounce the devil and all his works, the pomps  |
| and vanity of this wicked world, and all the sinful lusts of the      |
| flesh; Secondly, that I should believe all the Articles of the        |
| Christian Faith; And Thirdly, that I should keep God\'s holy will and |
| commandments, and walk in the same all the days of my life.\          |

| **Question.** Do you not think that you are bound so to do?\          |
| **Answer.** Yes, verily; and by God\'s help so I will. And I heartily |
| thank our heavenly Father, that he hath called me to this state of    |
| salvation, through Jesus Christ our Saviour. And I pray unto God to   |
| give me his grace, that I may continue in the same unto my life\'s    |
| end.                                                                  |

| I BELIEVE in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth: And  |
| in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord: Who was conceived by the Holy  |
| Ghost, Born of the Virgin Mary: Suffered under Pontius Pilate, Was    |
| crucified, dead, and buried: He descended into hell; The third day he |
| rose again from the dead: He ascended into heaven, And sitteth on the |
| right hand of God the Father Almighty: From thence he shall come to   |
| judge the quick and the dead. I believe in the Holy Ghost: The holy   |
| Catholic Church; The Communion of Saints: The Forgiveness of sins:    |
| The Resurrection of the body: And the Life everlasting. Amen.         |

| **Question.** What do you chiefly learn in these Articles of your     |
| Belief?\                                                              |
| **Answer.** First, I learn to believe in God the Father, who hath     |
| made me, and all the world.\                                          |
| Secondly, in God the Son, who hath redeemed me, and all mankind.\     |
| Thirdly, in God the Holy Ghost, who sanctifieth me, and all the       |
| people of God. And this Holy Trinity, One God, I praise and magnify,  |
| saying,                                                               |
