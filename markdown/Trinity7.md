| and drank wine before the thousand.\                                  |
| 2 Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the       |
| golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken   |
| out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his      |
| princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.\         |
| 3 Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the     |
| temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and  |
| his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.\           |
| []{#anchor45123}4 They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and  |
| of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.\                 |
| 5 In the same hour came forth fingers of a man\'s hand, and wrote     |
| over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the      |
| king\'s palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.\    |
| 6 Then the king\'s countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled |
| him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote |
| one against another.\                                                 |
| 7 The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans,    |
| and the soothsayers. And the king spake, and said to the wise men of  |
| Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and show me the           |
| interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a     |
| chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the     |

| 8 Then came in all the king\'s wise men: but they could not read the  |
| writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof.\      |
| 9 Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was  |
| changed in him, and his lords were astonied.\                         |
| 13 Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake and |
| said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the children of  |
| the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of        |
| Jewry?\                                                               |
| 14 I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, |
| and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in     |
| thee.\                                                                |
| 15 And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in before |
| me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the    |
| interpretation thereof: but they could not show the interpretation of |
| the thing:\                                                           |
| 16 And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations,    |
| and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing, and make     |
| known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with    |
| scarlet, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the    |
| third ruler in the kingdom.\                                          |
| 17 Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to |
| thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing |
| unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation.\             |
| 18 O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a    |
| kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour:\                         |
| 19 And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and     |
| languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and |
| whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he |
| would he put down.\                                                   |
| 20 But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride,  |
| he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from   |
| him:\                                                                 |
| 21 And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made     |
| like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they fed   |
| him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of        |
| heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of   |
| men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will.\              |
| 22 And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart,      |
| though thou knewest all this;\                                        |
| []{#anchor46681}23 But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of     |
| heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee,   |
| and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk    |
| wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of  |
| brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and  |
| the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast |
| thou not glorified:\                                                  |
| 24 Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was  |
| written.\                                                             |
| 25 And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL,       |
| UPHARSIN.\                                                            |
| 26 This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered   |
| thy kingdom, and finished it.\                                        |
| []{#anchor47944}27 TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art   |

| Persians.\                                                            |
| 29 Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet,   |
| and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation       |
| concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.\    |
| 30 In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.\     |

| 10 Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a  |
| tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great.\    |
| 11 The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto |
| heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth:\           |
| 12 The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in   |
| it was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and |
| the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh    |
| was fed of it.\                                                       |

| watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;\                       |
| 14 He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his  |
| branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts |
| get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches:\             |
| 15 Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with  |
| a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let   |
| it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the     |
| beasts in the grass of the earth:\                                    |
| 16 Let his heart be changed from man\'s, and let a beast\'s heart be  |
| given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.\                   |

| the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know     |
| that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to     |
| whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.\        |

| the dead I am called in question.\                                    |

| 9 And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the       |

| against God.\                                                         |

| Benjamite, a mighty man of power.\                                    |

| Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land  |
| of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of |
| the Benjamites, but they found them not.\                             |
| 5 And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his       |
| servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father    |
| leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.\                 |
| 6 And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of    |
| God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to  |
| pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can show us our way that |
| we should go.\                                                        |
| 7 Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we |
| bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is    |
| not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?\              |
| 8 And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here  |
| at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to    |
| the man of God, to tell us our way.\                                  |

| There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come |
| and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.\                           |

| meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon     |
| whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation:\         |
| 22 It is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy      |

| 23 And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down     |
| from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave |
| the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron |
| and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with   |
| the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the      |
| field, till seven times pass over him;\                               |
| 24 This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the  |
| most High, which is come upon my lord the king:\                      |
| 25 That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be     |
| with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass   |
| as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven    |
| times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth  |
| in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.\          |
| 26 And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots;   |
| thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known |
| that the heavens do rule.\                                            |
| 27 Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and     |
| break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by showing  |
| mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.\   |

| nor drink till they had killed Paul.\                                 |

| Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this     |
| young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.\            |
| 19 Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him     |
| aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?\   |
| 20 And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou         |
| wouldest bring down Paul tomorrow into the council, as though they    |
| would inquire somewhat of him more perfectly.\                        |
| 21 But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of  |
| them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath,   |
| that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and   |
| now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.\                 |
| 22 So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged    |
| him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shown these things to me.\   |
| 23 And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two      |
| hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten,  |

| whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people.\       |
| 18 Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I    |
| pray thee, where the seer\'s house is.\                               |
| 19 And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before me |
| unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me today, and tomorrow I   |
| will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart.\     |

| Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father\'s house?\           |

| unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed   |
| the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever,   |
| whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from    |

| 11 There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy   |

| wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king  |
| Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made master   |
| of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;\           |
| 12 Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and               |
| understanding, interpreting of dreams, and showing of hard sentences, |

| the interpretation.\                                                  |

| 5 Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with |
| me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.\          |

| unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat          |
| commanded Paul to be brought.\                                        |

| which they could not prove.\                                          |

| any thing at all.\                                                    |

| said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these      |
| things before me?\                                                    |

| to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well     |
| knowest.\                                                             |

| like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they fed   |
| him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of        |
| heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of   |

| me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.\          |
| 6 And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down |
| unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat          |
| commanded Paul to be brought.\                                        |
| 7 And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood |
| round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul,      |
| which they could not prove.\                                          |
| 8 While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, |
| neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended   |
| any thing at all.\                                                    |
| 9 But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and   |
| said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these      |
| things before me?\                                                    |
| 10 Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar\'s judgment seat, where I ought  |
| to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well     |
| knowest.\                                                             |
| []{#anchor130175}11 For if I be an offender, or have committed any    |
| thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of   |
| these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto      |
| them. I appeal unto Caesar.\                                          |
| 12 Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered,     |
| Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.\           |
| 13 And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea |
| to salute Festus.\                                                    |
| 14 And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul\'s    |
| cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by  |
| Felix:\                                                               |
| 15 About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the     |
| elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against     |
| him.\                                                                 |
| 16 To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver  |
| any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers     |
| face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the   |
| crime laid against him.\                                              |
| 17 Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the    |
| morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be        |
| brought forth.\                                                       |
| 18 Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none         |
| accusation of such things as I supposed:\                             |
| 19 But had certain questions against him of their own superstition,   |
| and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.\    |
| 20 And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him     |
| whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these        |
| matters.\                                                             |
| 21 But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of      |
| Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to         |
| Caesar.\                                                              |
| 22 Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself.   |
| Tomorrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.\                              |
| 23 And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great  |
| pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief       |
| captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus\' commandment Paul |
| was brought forth.\                                                   |
| 24 And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present  |
| with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews    |
| have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he  |
| ought not to live any longer.\                                        |
| 25 But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death,    |
| and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to   |
| send him.\                                                            |
| 26 Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I |
| have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king  |
| Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to        |
| write.\                                                               |
| 27 For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not      |
| withal to signify the crimes laid against him.\                       |
