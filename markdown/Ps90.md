| **Psalm 90. Domine, refugium.**\                                      |
| LORD, thou hast been our refuge, \* from one generation to another.\  |
| 2 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and the  |
| world were made, \* thou art God from everlasting, and world without  |
| end.\                                                                 |
| 3 Thou turnest man to destruction; \* again thou sayest, Come again,  |
| ye children of men.\                                                  |
| 4 For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is   |
| past, \* and as a watch in the night.\                                |
| 5 As soon as thou scatterest them they are even as a sleep; \* and    |
| fade away suddenly like the grass.\                                   |
| 6 In the morning it is green, and groweth up; \* but in the evening   |
| it is cut down, dried up, and withered.\                              |
| 7 For we consume away in thy displeasure, \* and are afraid at thy    |
| wrathful indignation.\                                                |
| 8 Thou hast set our misdeeds before thee; \* and our secret sins in   |
| the light of thy countenance.\                                        |
| 9 For when thou art angry all our days are gone: \* we bring our      |
| years to an end, as it were a tale that is told.\                     |
| 10 The days of our age are threescore years and ten; and though men   |
| be so strong that they come to fourscore years, \* yet is their       |
| strength then but labour and sorrow; so soon passeth it away, and we  |
| are gone.\                                                            |
| 11 But who regardeth the power of thy wrath? \* or feareth aright thy |
| indignation?\                                                         |
| 12 So teach us to number our days, \* that we may apply our hearts    |
| unto wisdom.\                                                         |
| 13 Turn thee again, O LORD, at the last, \* and be gracious unto thy  |
| servants.\                                                            |
| 14 O satisfy us with thy mercy, and that soon: \* so shall we rejoice |
| and be glad all the days of our life.\                                |
| 15 Comfort us again now after the time that thou hast plagued us; \*  |
| and for the years wherein we have suffered adversity.\                |
| 16 Show thy servants thy work, \* and their children thy glory.\      |
| 17 And the glorious majesty of the LORD our God be upon us: \*        |
| prosper thou the work of our hands upon us; O prosper thou our        |
| handy-work.                                                           |
