| THE LORD is King, and hath put on glorious apparel; \* the LORD hath  |
| put on his apparel, and girded himself with strength.\                |
| 2 He hath made the round world so sure, \* that it cannot be moved.\  |
| 3 Ever since the world began, hath thy seat been prepared: \* thou    |
| art from everlasting.\                                                |
| 4 The floods are risen, O LORD, the floods have lift up their voice;  |
| \* the floods lift up their waves.\                                   |
| 5 The waves of the sea are mighty, and rage horribly; \* but yet the  |
| LORD, who dwelleth on high, is mightier.\                             |
| 6 Thy testimonies, O LORD, are very sure: \* holiness becometh thine  |
| house for ever.                                                       |
