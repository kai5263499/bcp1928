| 1 At the same time, saith the LORD, will I be the God of all the      |
| families of Israel, and they shall be my people.\                     |
| 2 Thus saith the LORD, The people which were left of the sword found  |
| grace in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him to     |
| rest.\                                                                |
| 3 The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved    |
| thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I   |
| drawn thee.\                                                          |
| 4 Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of       |
| Israel: thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go    |
| forth in the dances of them that make merry.\                         |
| 5 Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the       |
| planters shall plant, and shall eat them as common things.\           |
| 6 For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon the mount Ephraim  |
| shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the LORD our God.\ |
| 7 For thus saith the LORD; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout    |
| among the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O     |
| LORD, save thy people, the remnant of Israel.\                        |
| 8 Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them   |
| from the coasts of the earth, and with them the blind and the lame,   |
| the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a   |
| great company shall return thither.\                                  |
| 9 They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead    |
| them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight |
| way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and |
| Ephraim is my firstborn.\                                             |
| 10 Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare it in the     |
| isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him,    |
| and keep him, as a shepherd doth his flock.\                          |
| 11 For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand   |
| of him that was stronger than he.\                                    |
| 12 Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and      |
| shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat, and for   |
| wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd:    |
| and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not       |
| sorrow any more at all.\                                              |

| their brethren the Jews.\                                             |
| 2 For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are      |
| many: therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and live.\ |
| 3 Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands,        |
| vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the         |
| dearth.\                                                              |

| tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards.\                      |
| 5 Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as  |
| their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our       |
| daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought unto  |
| bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other |
| men have our lands and vineyards.\                                    |
| 6 And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.\       |

| rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. |
| And I set a great assembly against them.\                             |
| 8 And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our        |
| brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even |
| sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they     |
| their peace, and found nothing to answer.\                            |
| 9 Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the |
| fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?\  |
| 10 I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them  |
| money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.\             |
| 11 Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their    |

| them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and    |
| took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise.\ |
| 13 Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his |
| house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even    |

| feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the |
| hairs of her head.\                                                   |

| 17 Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in |
| Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and |
| encamped in Mizpeh.\                                                  |
| 29 Then the spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over |
| Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from      |
| Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon.\          |
| 30 And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt    |
| without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands,\          |
| 31 Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my  |
| house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon,  |
| shall surely be the LORD\'S, and I will offer it up for a burnt       |
| offering.\                                                            |
| 32 So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight        |
| against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.\            |
| 33 And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even |
| twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great |
| slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the         |
| children of Israel.\                                                  |
| 34 And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his       |
| daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she  |
| was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.\      |
| 35 And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes,    |
| and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou  |
| art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the  |
| LORD, and I cannot go back.\                                          |
| 36 And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth    |
| unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of |
| thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of     |
| thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon.\                        |

| the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.\            |
| 38 And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went |
| with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.\  |
| 39 And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned    |
| unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had   |
| vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,\           |

| 1 And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city   |
| and village, preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of |
| God: and the twelve were with him,\                                   |
| 2 And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and        |
| infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,\   |
| 3 And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod\'s steward, and Susanna, and     |
| many others, which ministered unto him of their substance.\           |
| 4 And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him   |
| out of every city, he spake by a parable:\                            |
| 5 A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the |
| way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured  |
| it.\                                                                  |
| 6 And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it      |
| withered away, because it lacked moisture.\                           |
| 7 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and   |
| choked it.\                                                           |
| 8 And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an     |
| hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that     |
| hath ears to hear, let him hear.\                                     |
| 9 And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?\   |
| 10 And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the     |
| kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not |
| see, and hearing they might not understand.\                          |
| 11 Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.\             |
| 12 Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil,   |
| and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should        |
| believe and be saved.\                                                |
| 13 They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word |
| with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in   |
| time of temptation fall away.\                                        |
| 14 And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have   |
| heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures   |
| of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.\                      |
| 15 But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good  |
| heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with     |
| patience.\                                                            |

| 10 And there came out of them a wicked root Antiochus surnamed        |
| Epiphanes, son of Antiochus the king, who had been an hostage at      |
| Rome, and he reigned in the hundred and thirty and seventh year of    |
| the kingdom of the Greeks.\                                           |
| 11 In those days went there out of Israel wicked men, who persuaded   |
