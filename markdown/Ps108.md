| **Psalm 108. Paratum cor meum.**\                                     |
| O GOD, my heart is ready, my heart is ready; \* I will sing, and give |
| praise with the best member that I have.\                             |
| 2 Awake, thou lute and harp; \* I myself will awake right early.\     |
| 3 I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the peoples; \* I will  |
| sing praises unto thee among the nations.\                            |
| 4 For thy mercy is greater than the heavens, \* and thy truth         |
| reacheth unto the clouds.\                                            |
| 5 Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens, \* and thy glory above    |
| all the earth;\                                                       |
| 6 That thy beloved may be delivered: \* let thy right hand save them, |
| and hear thou me.\                                                    |
| 7 God hath spoken in his holiness; \* I will rejoice therefore, and   |
| divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.\                  |
| 8 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; \* Ephraim also is the        |
| strength of my head; Judah is my lawgiver;\                           |
| 9 Moab is my wash-pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; \* upon     |
| Philistia will I triumph.\                                            |
| 10 Who will lead me into the strong city? \* and who will bring me    |
| into Edom?\                                                           |
| 11 Hast not thou forsaken us, O God? \* and wilt not thou, O God, go  |
| forth with our hosts?\                                                |
| 12 O help us against the enemy: \* for vain is the help of man.\      |
| 13 Through God we shall do great acts; \* and it is he that shall     |
| tread down our enemies.                                               |
