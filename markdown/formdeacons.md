###### *¶ When the day appointed by the Bishop is come, thereshall be a Sermon, or Exhortation, declaring the Duty and Officeof such as come to be admitted Deacons; how necessary that Orderis in the Church of Christ, and also, how the People ought toesteem them in their Office.  ¶ The Sermon being ended, a Priest shall present unto theBishop, sitting in his chair near to the Holy Table, such as desireto be ordained Deacons, each of them being decently habited, sayingthese words,*

\
REVEREND Father in God, I present unto you these persons present,to be
admitted Deacons.

*¶ The Bishop*

\
TAKE heed that the persons, whom ye present unto us, be apt andmeet, for
their learning and godly conversation, to exercise theirMinistry duly,
to the honour of God, and the edifying of his Church.

*¶ The Priest shall answer,*

\
I HAVE inquired concerning them, and also examined them, and thinkthem
so to be.

*¶ Then the Bishop shall say unto the People,*

\
BRETHREN, if there be any of you who knoweth any Impediment, ornotable
Crime, in any of these persons presented to be orderedDeacons, for the
which he ought not to be admitted to that Office,let him come forth in
the Name of God, and show what the Crimeor Impediment is.

###### *¶ And if any great Crime or Impediment be objected,the Bishop shall cease from Ordering that person, until such timeas the party accused shall be found clear of that Crime.  ¶ Then the Bishop (commending such as shall be found meetto be Ordered, to the Prayers of the congregation) shall, withthe Clergy and People present, say the Litany.  ¶ And NOTE, That after the Suffrage, That it may please theeto illuminate all Bishops, etc., shall be said the following Suffrage:*

\
THAT it may please thee to bless these thy servants, now to beadmitted
to the Order of Deacons, and to pour thy grace upon them;that they may
duly execute their Office, to the edifying of thyChurch, and the glory
of thy holy Name;

###### *¶ And NOTE further, That in the discretion of theBishop, instead of the Litany appointed, may be said the Litanyfor Ordinations.  ¶ Then shall be said the Service for the Communion, withthe Collect, Epistle, and Gospel, as followeth.*

*The Collect.*

ALMIGHTY God, who by thy divine providence hast appointed diversOrders
of Ministers in thy Church, and didst inspire thine Apostlesto choose
into the Order of Deacons the first Martyr Saint Stephen,with others;
Mercifully behold these thy servants now called tothe like Office and
Administration: so replenish them with thetruth of thy Doctrine, and
adorn them with innocency of life,that, both by word and good example,
they may faithfully servethee in this Office, to the glory of thy Name,
and the edificationof thy Church; through the merits of our Saviour
Jesus Christ,who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Ghost, now
andfor ever. *Amen.\
*

*The Epistle.* 1 Timothy iii. 8.

LIKEWISE must the deacons be grave, not double tongued, notgiven to much
wine, not greedy of filthy lucre; holding the mysteryof the faith in a
pure conscience. And let these also first beproved; then let them use
the office of a deacon, being foundblameless. Even so must their wives
be grave, not slanderers,sober, faithful in all things. Let the deacons
be the husbandsof one wife, ruling their children and their own houses
well.For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase
tothemselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith whichis in
Christ Jesus.

*¶ Or else.*

\
*The Epistle.* Acts vi. 2.

THEN the twelve called the multitude of the disciples untothem, and
said, It is not reason that we should leave the wordof God, and serve
tables. Wherefore, brethren, look ye out amongyou seven men of honest
report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom,whom we may appoint over this
business. But we will give ourselvescontinually to prayer, and to the
ministry of the word. And thesaying pleased the whole multitude: and
they chose Stephen, aman full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and
Philip, and Prochorus,and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas
a proselyteof Antioch: whom they set before the apostles: and when they
hadprayed, they laid their hands on them. And the word of God
increased;and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem
greatly;and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.

###### *¶ Then, the People being sealed, the Bishop shallexamine every one of those who are to be Ordered, in the presenceof the People, after this manner following*

###### * ¶ Then, the People standing, the Bishop shall lay his Handsseverally upon the Head of every one to be made Deacon, humblykneeling before him, and shall say,*

\
TAKE thou Authority to execute the Office of a Deacon in the Churchof
God committed unto thee; In the Name of the Father, and ofthe Son, and

preach the same, if thou be thereto licensed by the Bishophimself.

*\
¶ Then one of them, appointed by the Bishop, shall read theGospel.*

*The Gospel.* St. Luke xii. 35.

LET your loins be girded about, and your lights burning; andye
yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when hewill return
from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh,they may open unto
him immediately. Blessed are those servants,whom the lord when he cometh
shall find watching: verily I sayunto you, that he shall gird himself,
and make them to sit downto meat, and will come forth and serve them.
And if he shall comein the second watch, or come in the third watch, and
find themso, blessed are those servants.

###### *¶ Then shall the Bishop proceed in the Communion;and all who are Ordered shall tarry, and receive the Holy Communionthe same day, with the Bishop.  ¶ The Communion ended, after the last Collect, and immediatelybefore the Benediction, shall be said this Collect following.*

vouchsafed to accept and take these thy servants unto theOffice of
Deacons in thy Church; Make them, we beseech thee, OLord, to be modest,
humble, and constant in their Ministration,to have a ready will to
observe all spiritual Discipline; thatthey, having always the testimony
of a good conscience, and continuingever stable and strong in thy Son
Christ, may so well behave themselvesin this inferior Office, that they
may be found worthy to be calledunto the higher Ministries in thy
Church; through the same thySon our Saviour Jesus Christ, to whom be
glory and honour, worldwithout end. *Amen.*\
\
THE Peace of God, which passeth all understanding. keep your heartsand
minds in the knowledge and love of God, and of his Son JesusChrist our
Lord: And the Blessing of God Almighty, the Father,the Son, and the Holy
Ghost, be amongst you, and remain with youalways. *Amen.*

###### *¶ And here it must be declared unto the Deacon, thathe must continue in that Office of a Deacon the space of a wholeyear, (except for reasonable causes it shall otherwise seem goodunto the Bishop,) to the intent he may be perfect and well expertin the things appertaining to the Ecclesiastical Administration.In executing whereof if he be found faithful and diligent, hemay be admitted by his Diocesan to the Order of Priesthood, atthe times appointed in the Canon; or else, on urgent occasion,upon some other day, in the face of the Church, in such mannerand form as hereafter followeth.*
