The Collect.

GRANT, O Lord, that, in all our sufferings here upon earth for the
testimony of thy truth, we may stedfastly look up to heaven, and by
faith behold the glory that shall be revealed; and, being filled with
the Holy Ghost, may learn to love and bless our persecutors by the
example of thy first Martyr Saint Stephen, who prayed for his murderers
to thee, O blessed Jesus, who standest at the right hand of God to
succour all those who suffer for thee. our only Mediator and Advocate.
Amen.\

For the Epistle. Acts vii. 55.

STEPHEN, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven,
and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,
and said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing
on the right hand of God. Then they cried out with a loud voice, and
stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord, and cast him out
of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes
at a young man\'s feet, whose name was Saul. And they stoned Stephen,
calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. And he
kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to
their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.\

The Gospel. St. Matthew xxiii. 34.

BEHOLD, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of
them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in
your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city: that upon you may
come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of
righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye
slew between the temple and the altar. Verily I say unto you, All these
things shall come upon this generation. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou
that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee,
how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen
gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! Behold, your
house is left unto you desolate. For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me
henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of
the Lord.
