| 1 Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of |

| to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.\                               |
| 2 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out  |

| with fire, and the bush was not consumed.\                            |

| him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he      |
| said, Here am I.\                                                     |

| he was afraid to look upon God.\                                      |
| 7 And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people   |
| which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their       |
| taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;\                               |
| 8 And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the           |
| Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and |
| a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of   |
| the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the           |
| Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.\                      |

| oppress them.\                                                        |
| 10 Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou   |
| mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.\    |
| 11 And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh,  |
| and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?\   |
| 12 And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a    |
| token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth  |
| the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.\      |
| 13 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of  |
| Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me |
| unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I    |
| say unto them?\                                                       |
