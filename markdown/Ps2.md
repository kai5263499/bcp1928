| PSALM +\                                                              |
| \                                                                     |
|                                                                       |
| **Psalms 2. Quare fremuerunt gentes?**\                               |
| WHY do the heathen so furiously rage together? \* and why do the      |
| people imagine a vain thing?\                                         |
| 2 The kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take counsel        |
| together \* against the LORD, and against his Anointed:\              |
| 3 Let us break their bonds asunder, \* and cast away their cords from |
| us.\                                                                  |
| 4 He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh them to scorn: \* the Lord   |
| shall have them in derision.\                                         |
| 5 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, \* and vex them in his  |
| sore displeasure:\                                                    |
| 6 Yet have I set my King \* upon my holy hill of Sion.\               |
| 7 I will rehearse the decree; \* the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art |
| my Son, this day have I begotten thee.\                               |
| 8 Desire of me, and I shall give thee the nations for thine           |
| inheritance, \* and the utmost parts of the earth for thy             |
| possession.\                                                          |
| 9 Thou shalt bruise them with a rod of iron, \* and break them in     |
| pieces like a potter\'s vessel.\                                      |
| 10 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings; \* be instructed, ye that are   |
| judges of the earth.\                                                 |
| 11 Serve the LORD in fear, \* and rejoice unto him with reverence.\   |
| 12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and so ye perish from the right    |
| way, if his wrath be kindled, yea but a little. \* Blessed are all    |
| they that put their trust in him.                                     |
