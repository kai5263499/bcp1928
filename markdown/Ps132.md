| **Psalm 132. Memento, Domine.**\                                      |
| LORD, remember David, \* and all his trouble:\                        |
| 2 How he sware unto the LORD, \* and vowed a vow unto the Almighty    |
| God of Jacob:\                                                        |
| 3 I will not come within the tabernacle of mine house, \* nor climb   |
| up into my bed;\                                                      |
| 4 I will not suffer mine eyes to sleep, nor mine eyelids to slumber;  |
| \* neither the temples of my head to take any rest;\                  |
| 5 Until I find out a place for the temple of the LORD; \* an          |
| habitation for the Mighty God of Jacob.\                              |
| 6 Lo, we heard of the same at Ephratah, \* and found it in the wood.\ |
| 7 We will go into his tabernacle, \* and fall low on our knees before |
| his footstool.\                                                       |
| 8 Arise, O LORD, into thy resting-place; \* thou, and the ark of thy  |
| strength.\                                                            |
| 9 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; \* and let thy       |
| saints sing with joyfulness.\                                         |
| 10 For thy servant David\'s sake, \* turn not away the face of thine  |
| anointed.\                                                            |
| 11 The LORD hath made a faithful oath unto David, \* and he shall not |
| shrink from it:\                                                      |
| 12 Of the fruit of thy body \* shall I set upon thy throne.\          |
| 13 If thy children will keep my covenant, and my testimonies that I   |
| shall teach them; \* their children also shall sit upon thy throne    |
| for evermore.\                                                        |
| 14 For the LORD hath chosen Sion to be an habitation for himself; \*  |
| he hath longed for her.\                                              |
| 15 This shall be my rest for ever: \* here will I dwell, for I have a |
| delight therein.\                                                     |
| 16 I will bless her victuals with increase, \* and will satisfy her   |
| poor with bread.\                                                     |
| 17 I will deck her priests with health, \* and her saints shall       |
| rejoice and sing.\                                                    |
| 18 There shall I make the horn of David to flourish: \* I have        |
| ordained a lantern for mine anointed.\                                |
| 19 As for his enemies, I shall clothe them with shame; \* but upon    |
| himself shall his crown flourish.                                     |
