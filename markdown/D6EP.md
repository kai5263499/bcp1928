**Evening Prayer.\
Psalm 32. Beati quorum.**\
BLESSED is he whose unrighteousness is forgiven, \* and whose sin is
covered.\
2 Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth no sin, \* and in whose
spirit there is no guile.\
3 For whilst I held my tongue, \* my bones consumed away through my
daily complaining.\
4 For thy hand was heavy upon me day and night, \* and my moisture was
like the drought in summer.\
5 I acknowledged my sin unto thee; \* and mine unrighteousness have I
not hid.\
6 I said, I will confess my sins unto the LORD; \* and SO thou forgavest
the wickedness of my sin.\
7 For this shall every one that is godly make his prayer unto thee, in a
time when thou mayest be found; \* surely the great water-floods shall
not come nigh him.\
8 Thou art a place to hide me in; thou shalt preserve me from trouble;
\* thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance.\
9 I will inform thee, and teach thee in the way wherein thou shalt go;
\* and I will guide thee with mine eye.\
10 Be ye not like to horse and mule, which have no understanding; \*
whose mouths must be held with bit and bridle, else they will not obey
thee.\
11 Great plagues remain for the ungodly; \* but whoso putteth his trust
in the LORD, mercy embraceth him on every side.\
12 Be glad, O ye righteous, and rejoice in the LORD; \* and be joyful,
all ye that are true of heart.\

**Psalm 33. Exultate, justi.**\
REJOICE in the LORD, O ye righteous; \* for it becometh well the just to
be thankful.\
2 Praise the LORD with harp; \* sing praises unto him with the lute, and
instrument of ten strings.\
3 Sing unto the Lord a new song; \* sing praises lustily unto him with a
good courage.\
4 For the word of the LORD is true; \* and all his works are faithful.\
5 He loveth righteousness and judgment; \* the earth is full of the
goodness of the LORD.\
6 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; \* and all the host of
them by the breath of his mouth.\
7 He gathereth the waters of the sea together, as it were upon an heap;
\* and layeth up the deep, as in a treasure-house.\
8 Let all the earth fear the LORD: \* stand in awe of him, all ye that
dwell in the world.\
9 For he spake, and it was done; \* he commanded, and it stood fast.\
10 The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought, \* and maketh
the devices of the people to be of none effect, and casteth out the
counsels of princes.\
11 The counsel of the LORD shall endure for ever, \* and the thoughts of
his heart from generation to generation.\
12 Blessed are the people whose God is the Lord JEHOVAH; \* and blessed
are the folk that he hath chosen to him, to be his inheritance.\
13 The LORD looketh down from heaven, and beholdeth all the children of
men; \* from the habitation of his dwelling, he considereth all them
that dwell on the earth.\
14 He fashioneth all the hearts of them, \* and understandeth all their
works.\
15 There is no king that can be saved by the multitude of an host; \*
neither is any mighty man delivered by much strength.\
16 A horse is counted but a vain thing to save a man; \* neither shall
he deliver any man by his great strength.\
17 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, \* and upon
them that put their trust in his mercy;\
18 To deliver their soul from death, \* and to feed them in the time of
dearth.\
19 Our soul hath patiently tarried for the LORD; \* for he is our help
and our shield.\
20 For our heart shall rejoice in him; \* because we have hoped in his
holy Name.\
21 Let thy merciful kindness, O LORD, be upon us, \* like as we do put
our trust in thee.\

**Psalm 34. Benedicam Dominum.**\
I WILL alway give thanks unto the LORD; \* his praise shall ever be in
my mouth.\
2 My soul shall make her boast in the LORD; \* the humble shall hear
thereof, and be glad.\
3 O praise the LORD with me, \* and let us magnify his Name together.\
4 I sought the LORD, and he heard me; \* yea, he delivered me out of all
my fear.\
5 They had an eye unto him, and were lightened; \* and their faces were
not ashamed.\
6 Lo, the poor crieth, and the LORD heareth him; \* yea, and saveth him
out of all his troubles.\
7 The angel of the LORD tarrieth round about them that fear him, \* and
delivereth them.\
8 O taste, and see, how gracious the LORD is: \* blessed is the man that
trusteth in him.\
9 O fear the LORD, ye that are his saints; \* for they that fear him
lack nothing.\
10 The lions do lack, and suffer hunger; \* but they who seek the LORD
shall want no manner of thing that is good.\
11 Come, ye children, and hearken unto me; \* I will teach you the fear
of the LORD.\
12 What man is he that lusteth to live, \* and would fain see good
days?\
13 Keep thy tongue from evil, \* and thy lips, that they speak no
guile.\
14 Eschew evil, and do good; \* seek peace, and ensue it.\
15 The eyes of the LORD are over the righteous, \* and his ears are open
unto their prayers.\
16 The countenance of the LORD is against them that do evil, \* to root
out the remembrance of them from the earth.\
17 The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth them, \* and delivereth them
out of all their troubles.\
18 The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart, \* and will
save such as be of an humble spirit.\
19 Great are the troubles of the righteous; \* but the LORD delivereth
him out of all.\
20 He keepeth all his bones, \* so that not one of them is broken.\
21 But misfortune shall slay the ungodly; \* and they that hate the
righteous shall be desolate.\
22 The LORD delivereth the souls of his servants; \* and all they that
put their trust in him shall not be destitute.
