| 1 Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of  |
| Mary and her sister Martha.\                                          |
| 2 (It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped  |
| his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)\             |
| 3 Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom  |
| thou lovest is sick.\                                                 |
| 4 When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death,    |
| but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified      |
| thereby.\                                                             |
| 5 Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.\               |
| 6 When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days     |
| still in the same place where he was.\                                |
| 7 Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea    |

| stone thee; and goest thou thither again?\                            |
| []{#anchor352857}9 Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the  |
| day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth   |
| the light of this world.\                                             |
| 10 But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no  |
| light in him.\                                                        |
| 11 These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our       |
| friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of        |
| sleep.\                                                               |
| 12 Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.\     |
| 13 Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had     |
| spoken of taking of rest in sleep.\                                   |
| 14 Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.\               |
| 15 And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent   |
| ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.\                     |
