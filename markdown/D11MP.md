**Psalm 56. Miserere mei, Deus.**\
BE merciful unto me, O God, for man goeth about to devour me; \* he is
daily fighting, and troubling me.\
2 Mine enemies are daily at hand to swallow me up; \* for they be many
that fight against me, O thou Most Highest.\
3 Nevertheless, though I am sometime afraid, \* yet put I my trust in
thee.\
4 I will praise God, because of his word: \* I have put my trust in God,
and will not fear what flesh can do unto me.\
5 They daily mistake my words; \* all that they imagine is to do me
evil.\
6 They hold all together, and keep themselves close, \* and mark my
steps, when they lay wait for my soul.\
7 Shall they escape for their wickedness? \* thou, O God, in thy
displeasure shalt cast them down.\
8 Thou tellest my wanderings; put my tears into thy bottle: \* are not
these things noted in thy book?\
9 Whensoever I call upon thee, then shall mine enemies be put to flight:
\* this I know; for God is on my side.\
10 In God\'s word will I rejoice; \* in the LORD\'S word will I comfort
me.\
11 Yea, in God have I put my trust; \* I will not be afraid what man can
do unto me.\
12 Unto thee, O God, will I pay my vows; \* unto thee will I give
thanks.\
13 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, and my feet from falling,
\* that I may walk before God in the light of the living.\

**Psalm 57. Miserere mei, Deus.**\
BE merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me; for my soul trusteth in
thee; \* and under the shadow of thy wings shall be my refuge, until
this tyranny be overpast.\
2 I will call unto the Most High God, \* even unto the God that shall
perform the cause which I have in hand.\
3 He shall send from heaven, \* and save me from the reproof of him that
would eat me up.\
4 God shall send forth his mercy and truth: \* my soul is among lions;\
5 And I lie even among the children of men, that are set on fire, \*
whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.\
6 Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens; \* and thy glory above all
the earth.\
7 They have laid a net for my feet, and pressed down my soul; \* they
have digged a pit before me, and are fallen into the midst of it
themselves.\
8 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed; \* I will sing and give
praise.\
9 Awake up, my glory; awake, lute and harp: \* I myself will awake right
early.\
10 I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the peoples; \* and I
will sing unto thee among the nations.\
11 For the greatness of thy mercy reacheth unto the heavens, \* and thy
truth unto the clouds.\
12 Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens; \* and thy glory above all
the earth.\

**Psalm 58. Si vere utique.**\
ARE your minds set upon righteousness, O ye congregation? \* and do ye
judge the thing that is right, O ye sons of men?\
2 Yea, ye imagine mischief in your heart upon the earth, \* and your
hands deal with wickedness.\
3 The ungodly are froward, even from their mother\'s womb; \* as soon as
they are born, they go astray, and speak lies.\
4 They are as venomous as the poison of a serpent, \* even like the deaf
adder, that stoppeth her ears;\
5 Which refuseth to hear the voice of the charmer, \* charm he never so
wisely.\
6 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouths; \* smite the jaw-bones of
the lions, O LORD.\
7 Let them fall away like water that runneth apace; \* when they shoot
their arrows, let them be rooted out.\
8 Let them consume away like a snail, and be like the untimely fruit of
a woman; \* and let them not see the sun.\
9 Or ever your pots be made hot with thorns, \* he shall take them away
with a whirlwind, the green and the burning alike.\
10 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance; \* he shall
wash his footsteps in the blood of the ungodly.\
11 So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous;
\* doubtless there is a God that judgeth the earth.
