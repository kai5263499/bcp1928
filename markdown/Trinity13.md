| 1 And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said |
| unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other |
| poor.\                                                                |
| 2 The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:\                  |
| 3 But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he    |
| had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and    |
| with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own   |
| cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.\           |
| []{#anchor113768}4 And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and  |
| he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for  |
| the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man\'s    |
| lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.\               |
| 5 And David\'s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said |
| to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing      |
| shall surely die:\                                                    |

| and because he had no pity.\                                          |

| of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out |
| of the hand of Saul;\                                                 |
| 8 And I gave thee thy master\'s house, and thy master\'s wives into   |
| thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if     |
| that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such  |
| and such things.\                                                     |

| evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, |
| and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the   |
| sword of the children of Ammon.\                                      |

| in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by    |
| the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more |
| abundantly to you-ward.\                                              |

| and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex         |
| himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?\                      |
| 19 But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived    |
| that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is   |
| the child dead? And they said, He is dead.\                           |

| when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.\              |
| 22 And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for |
| I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the     |

| 1 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod |

| 2 Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen |
| his star in the east, and are come to worship him.\                   |
| 3 When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and    |
| all Jerusalem with him.\                                              |
| 4 And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the   |
| people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.\    |
| 5 And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is      |
| written by the prophet,\                                              |

| 1 And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots  |
| and horses, and fifty men to run before him.\                         |
| 2 And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate:    |
| and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the   |
| king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what    |
| city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of    |
| Israel.\                                                              |

| would do him justice!\                                                |

| 6 And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king  |
| for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.\      |

| 1 Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, |
| epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from      |
| you?\                                                                 |
| 2 Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all     |

| 3 Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ |
| ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the    |
| living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the       |
| heart.\                                                               |
| 4 And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:\                 |
| []{#anchor200966}5 Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think   |
| any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;\            |
| 6 Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of   |
| the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit |
| giveth life.\                                                         |
| 7 But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones,   |
| was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly     |
| behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which      |
| glory was to be done away:\                                           |
| 8 How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?\   |
| 9 For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth    |
| the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.\                   |
| 10 For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this         |
| respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.\                      |
| 11 For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which  |
| remaineth is glorious.\                                               |

| 13 And not as Moses, which put a veil over his face, that the         |
| children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which |
| is abolished:\                                                        |
| 14 But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the     |
| same veil untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which     |
| veil is done away in Christ.\                                         |
| 15 But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their |
| heart.\                                                               |

| the image of God, should shine unto them.\                            |

| 7 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency   |

| 15 For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might   |
| through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.\        |
| 16 For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish,   |
| yet the inward man is renewed day by day.\                            |

| cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to    |
| bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:\       |

| now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for   |

| Ecclesiasticus 19:4-18**\                                             |
| 4 He that is hasty to give credit is lightminded; and he that sinneth |
| shall offend against his own soul.\                                   |
| 5 Whoso taketh pleasure in wickedness shall be condemned: but he that |
| resisteth pleasures crowneth his life.\                               |
| 6 He that can rule his tongue shall live without strife; and he that  |
| hateth babbling shall have less evil.\                                |
| 7 Rehearse not unto another that which is told unto thee, and thou    |
| shalt fare never the worse.\                                          |
| 8 Whether it be to friend or foe, talk not of other men\'s lives; and |
| if thou canst without offence, reveal them not.\                      |
| 9 For he heard and observed thee, and when time cometh he will hate   |
| thee.\                                                                |
| 10 If thou hast heard a word, let it die with thee; and be bold, it   |
| will not burst thee.\                                                 |
| 11 A fool travaileth with a word, as a woman in labour of a child.\   |
| 12 As an arrow that sticketh in a man\'s thigh, so is a word within a |
| fool\'s belly.\                                                       |
| 13 Admonish a friend, it may be he hath not done it: and if he have   |
| done it, that he do it no more.\                                      |
| 14 Admonish thy friend, it may be he hath not said it: and if he      |
| have, that he speak it not again.\                                    |
| 15 Admonish a friend: for many times it is a slander, and believe not |
| every tale.\                                                          |
| 16. There is one that slippeth in his speech, but not from his heart; |
| and who is he that hath not offended with his tongue?\                |
| 17 Admonish thy neighbour before thou threaten him; and not being     |
| angry, give place to the law of the most High.\                       |
| 18 The fear of the Lord is the first step to be accepted \[of him,\]  |
| and wisdom obtaineth his love.\                                       |

| 12 Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he        |
| departed into Galilee;\                                               |
| 13 And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is     |
| upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:\        |
| 14 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, |
| saying,\                                                              |
| 15 The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the |
| sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;\                         |
| 16 The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them      |
| which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.\      |
| []{#anchor317182}17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, |
| Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\                        |
| 18 And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon  |
| called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for |
| they were fishers.\                                                   |
| 19 And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of  |
| men.\                                                                 |
| 20 And they straightway left their nets, and followed him.\           |
| 21 And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son |
| of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their        |
| father, mending their nets; and he called them.\                      |
| 22 And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed  |
| him.\                                                                 |
| 23 And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues,    |
| and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of    |
| sickness and all manner of disease among the people.\                 |
| 24 And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him  |
| all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments,    |
| and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were      |
| lunatic, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.\           |
| 25 And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee,    |
| and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from     |
| beyond Jordan.\                                                       |
