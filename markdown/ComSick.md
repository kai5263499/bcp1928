| ###### *¶ Forasmuch as all mortal men ar                              |
| e subject to many sudden perils, diseases and sicknesses, and ever un |
| certain what time they shall depart out of this life; therefore, to t |
| he intent they may be always in readiness to die, whensoever it shall |
|  please Almighty God to call them, the Ministers shall diligently fro |
| m time to time, but especially in the time of pestilence, or other in |
| fectious sickness, exhort their parishioners to the often receiving o |
| f the Holy Communion of the Body and Blood of our Saviour Christ, whe |
| n it shall be publicly administered in the Church; that so doing, the |
| y may, in case of sudden visitation, have the less cause to be disqui |
| eted for lack of the same. But if the sick person be not able to come |
|  to the Church, and yet is desirous to receive the Communion in his h |
| ouse; then he must give timely notice to the Minister, signifying als |
| o how many there are to communicate with him; and all things necessar |
| y being prepared, the Minister shall there celebrate the Holy Communi |
| on, beginning with the Collect, Epistle, and Gospel, here following.* |
|                                                                       |

| ALMIGHTY, everliving God, Maker of mankind, who dost correct those    |
| whom thou dost love, and chastise every one whom thou dost receive;   |
| We beseech thee to have mercy upon this thy servant visited with      |
| thine hand, and to grant that he may take his sickness patiently, and |
| recover his bodily health, if it be thy gracious will; and that,      |
| whensoever his soul shall depart from the body, it may be without     |
| spot presented unto thee; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\       |
|                                                                       |

| MY son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when   |
| thou art rebuked of him: for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and  |
| scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.\                               |
|                                                                       |

| VERILY, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and          |
| believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not   |
| come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.           |
|                                                                       |
| *¶ Or the following Collect, Epistle, and Gospel.*                    |
|                                                                       |

| O LORD, holy Father, by whose loving-kindness our souls and bodies    |
| are renewed; Mercifully look upon this thy servant, that, every cause |
| of sickness being removed, he may be restored to soundness of health; |
| through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\                                 |
|                                                                       |

|                                                                       |
| THESE things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the  |
| Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye   |
| may believe on the name of the Son of God. And this is the confidence |
| that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, |
| he heareth us: and if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we  |
| know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.\              |

| JESUS said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me   |
| hath everlasting life. I am that bread of life. Your fathers did eat  |
| manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This is the bread which cometh |
| down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. I am the   |
| living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this      |
| bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my   |
| flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.                   |

| render it expedient to shorten the Service, the following form shall  |
| suffice: The Confession and the Absolution; Lift up your hearts, etc. |

| O ALMIGHTY Father, Lord of heaven and earth, we confess that we have  |

| God, after thy great goodness; according to the multitude of thy      |
| mercies, do away our offences and cleanse us from our sins; for Jesus |
