| **Psalms 11. In Domino confido.**\                                    |
| IN the LORD put I my trust; \* how say ye then to my soul, that she   |
| should flee as a bird unto the hill?\                                 |
| 2 For lo, the ungodly bend their bow, and make ready their arrows     |
| within the quiver, \* that they may privily shoot at them which are   |
| true of heart.\                                                       |
| 3 If the foundations be destroyed, \* what can the righteous do?\     |
| 4 The LORD is in his holy temple; \* the LORD\'S seat is in heaven.\  |
| 5 His eyes consider the poor, \* and his eyelids try the children of  |
| men.\                                                                 |
| 6 The LORD approveth the righteous: \* but the ungodly, and him that  |
| delighteth in wickedness, doth his soul abhor.\                       |
| 7 Upon the ungodly he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, storm    |
| and tempest: \* this shall be their portion to drink.\                |
| 8 For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; \* his countenance     |
| will behold the thing that is just.                                   |
