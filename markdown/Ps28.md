| **Psalms 28. Ad te, Domine.**\                                        |
| UNTO thee will I cry, O LORD, my strength: \* think no scorn of me;   |
| lest, if thou make as though thou hearest not, I become like them     |
| that go down into the pit.\                                           |
| 2 Hear the voice of my humble petitions, when I cry unto thee; \*     |
| when I hold up my hands towards the mercyseat of thy holy temple.\    |
| 3 O pluck me not away, neither destroy me with the ungodly and wicked |
| doers, \* which speak friendly to their neighbours, but imagine       |
| mischief in their hearts.\                                            |
| 4 Reward them according to their deeds, \* and according to the       |
| wickedness of their own inventions.\                                  |
| 5 Recompense them after the work of their hands; \* pay them that     |
| they have deserved.\                                                  |
| 6 For they regard not in their mind the works of the LORD, nor the    |
| operation of his hands; \* therefore shall he break them down, and    |
| not build them up.\                                                   |
| 7 Praised be the LORD; \* for he hath heard the voice of my humble    |
| petitions.\                                                           |
| 8 The LORD is my strength, and my shield; my heart hath trusted in    |
| him, and I am helped; \* therefore my heart danceth for joy, and in   |
| my song will I praise him.\                                           |
| 9 The LORD is my strength, \* and he is the wholesome defence of his  |
| anointed.\                                                            |
| 10 O save thy people, and give thy blessing unto thine inheritance:   |
| \* feed them, and set them up for ever.                               |
