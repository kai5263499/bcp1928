| **Psalm 145. Exaltabo te, Deus.**\                                    |
| I WILL magnify thee, O God, my King; \* and I will praise thy Name    |
| for ever and ever.\                                                   |
| 2 Every day will I give thanks unto thee; \* and praise thy Name for  |
| ever and ever.\                                                       |
| 3 Great is the LORD, and marvellous worthy to be praised; \* there is |
| no end of his greatness.\                                             |
| 4 One generation shall praise thy works unto another, \* and declare  |
| thy power.\                                                           |
| 5 As for me, I will be talking of thy worship, \* thy glory, thy      |
| praise, and wondrous works;\                                          |
| 6 So that men shall speak of the might of thy marvellous acts; \* and |
| I will also tell of thy greatness.\                                   |
| 7 The memorial of thine abundant kindness shall be showed; \* and men |
| shall sing of thy righteousness.\                                     |
| 8 The LORD is gracious and merciful; \* long-suffering, and of great  |
| goodness.\                                                            |
| 9 The LORD is loving unto every man; \* and his mercy is over all his |
| works.\                                                               |
| 10 All thy works praise thee, O LORD; \* and thy saints give thanks   |
| unto thee.\                                                           |
| 11 They show the glory of thy kingdom, \* and talk of thy power;\     |
| 12 That thy power, thy glory, and mightiness of thy kingdom, \* might |
| be known unto men.\                                                   |
| 13 Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, \* and thy dominion         |
| endureth throughout all ages.\                                        |
| 14 The LORD upholdeth all such as fall, \* and lifteth up all those   |
| that are down.\                                                       |
| 15 The eyes of all wait upon thee, O Lord; \* and thou givest them    |
| their meat in due season.\                                            |
| 16 Thou openest thine hand, \* and fillest all things living with     |
| plenteousness.\                                                       |
| 17 The LORD is righteous in all his ways, \* and holy in all his      |
| works.\                                                               |
| 18 The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him; \* yea, all     |
| such as call upon him faithfully.\                                    |
| 19 He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him; \* he also will   |
| hear their cry, and will help them.\                                  |
| 20 The LORD preserveth all them that love him; \* but scattereth      |
| abroad all the ungodly.\                                              |
| 21 My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD; \* and let all flesh  |
| give thanks unto his holy Name for ever and ever.                     |
