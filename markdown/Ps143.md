| **Psalm 143. Domine, exaudi.**\                                       |
| HEAR my prayer, O LORD, and consider my desire; \* hearken unto me    |
| for thy truth and righteousness\' sake.\                              |
| 2 And enter not into judgment with thy servant; \* for in thy sight   |
| shall no man living be justified.\                                    |
| 3 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down |
| to the ground; \* he hath laid me in the darkness, as the men that    |
| have been long dead.\                                                 |
| 4 Therefore is my spirit vexed within me, \* and my heart within me   |
| is desolate.\                                                         |
| 5 Yet do I remember the time past; I muse upon all thy works; \* yea, |
| I exercise myself in the works of thy hands.\                         |
| 6 I stretch forth my hands unto thee; \* my soul gaspeth unto thee as |
| a thirsty land.\                                                      |
| 7 Hear me, O LORD, and that soon; for my spirit waxeth faint: \* hide |
| not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the  |
| pit.\                                                                 |
| 8 O let me hear thy loving-kindness betimes in the morning; for in    |
| thee is my trust: \* show thou me the way that I should walk in; for  |
| I lift up my soul unto thee.\                                         |
| 9 Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies; \* for I flee unto thee to   |
| hide me.\                                                             |
| 10 Teach me to do the thing that pleaseth thee; for thou art my God:  |
| \* let thy loving Spirit lead me forth into the land of               |
| righteousness.\                                                       |
| 11 Quicken me, O LORD, for thy Name\'s sake; \* and for thy           |
| righteousness\' sake bring my soul out of trouble.\                   |
| 12 And of thy goodness slay mine enemies, \* and destroy all them     |
| that vex my soul; for I am thy servant.                               |
