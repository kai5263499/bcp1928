| **Psalm 139. Domine, probasti.**\                                     |
| O LORD, thou hast searched me out, and known me. \* Thou knowest my   |
| down-sitting, and mine uprising; thou understandest my thoughts long  |
| before.\                                                              |
| 2 Thou art about my path, and about my bed; \* and art acquainted     |
| with all my ways.\                                                    |
| 3 For lo, there is not a word in my tongue, \* but thou, O LORD,      |
| knowest it altogether.\                                               |
| 4 Thou hast beset me behind and before, \* and laid thine hand upon   |
| me.\                                                                  |
| 5 Such knowledge is too wonderful and excellent for me; \* I cannot   |
| attain unto it.\                                                      |
| 6 Whither shall I go then from thy Spirit? \* or whither shall I go   |
| then from thy presence?\                                              |
| 7 If I climb up into heaven, thou art there; \* if I go down to hell, |
| thou art there also.\                                                 |
| 8 If I take the wings of the morning, \* and remain in the uttermost  |
| parts of the sea;\                                                    |
| 9 Even there also shall thy hand lead me, \* and thy right hand shall |
| hold me.\                                                             |
| 10 If I say, Peradventure the darkness shall cover me; \* then shall  |
| my night be turned to day.\                                           |
| 11 Yea, the darkness is no darkness with thee, but the night is as    |
| clear as the day; \* the darkness and light to thee are both alike.\  |
| 12 For my reins are thine; \* thou hast covered me in my mother\'s    |
| womb.\                                                                |
| 13 I will give thanks unto thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully   |
| made: \* marvellous are thy works, and that my soul knoweth right     |
| well.\                                                                |
| 14 My bones are not hid from thee, \* though I be made secretly, and  |
| fashioned beneath in the earth.\                                      |
| 15 Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being imperfect; \* and in    |
| thy book were all my members written;\                                |
| 16 Which day by day were fashioned, \* when as yet there was none of  |
| them.\                                                                |
| 17 How dear are thy counsels unto me, O God; \* O how great is the    |
| sum of them!\                                                         |
| 18 If I tell them, they are more in number than the sand: \* when I   |
| wake up, I am present with thee.\                                     |
| 19 Wilt thou not slay the wicked, O God? \* Depart from me, ye        |
| blood-thirsty men.\                                                   |
| 20 For they speak unrighteously against thee; \* and thine enemies    |
| take thy Name in vain.\                                               |
| 21 Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? \* and am not I        |
| grieved with those that rise up against thee?\                        |
| 22 Yea, I hate them right sore; \* even as though they were mine      |
| enemies.\                                                             |
| 23 Try me, O God, and seek the ground of my heart; \* prove me, and   |
| examine my thoughts.\                                                 |
| 24 Look well if there be any way of wickedness in me; \* and lead me  |
| in the way everlasting.\                                              |
| \                                                                     |

| Psalm 140. Eripe me, Domine.**\                                       |
| DELIVER me, O LORD, from the evil man; \* and preserve me from the    |
| wicked man;\                                                          |

| poison is under their lips.\                                          |
| 4 Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the ungodly; \* preserve me from |
| the wicked men, who are purposed to overthrow my goings.\             |
| 5 The proud have laid a snare for me, and spread a net abroad with    |
| cords; \* yea, and set traps in my way.\                              |
| 6 I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God, \* hear the voice of my      |
| prayers, O LORD.\                                                     |
| 7 O LORD God, thou strength of my health; \* thou hast covered my     |
| head in the day of battle.\                                           |
| 8 Let not the ungodly have his desire, O LORD; \* let not his         |
| mischievous imagination prosper, lest they be too proud.\             |
| 9 Let the mischief of their own lips fall upon the head of them \*    |
| that compass me about.\                                               |
| 10 Let hot burning coals fall upon them; \* let them be cast into the |
| fire, and into the pit, that they never rise up again.\               |
| 11 A man full of words shall not prosper upon the earth: \* evil      |
| shall hunt the wicked person to overthrow him.\                       |
| 12 Sure I am that the LORD will avenge the poor, \* and maintain the  |
| cause of the helpless.\                                               |
| 13 The righteous also shall give thanks unto thy Name; \* and the     |
| just shall continue in thy sight.\                                    |

| **Psalm 141. Domine, clamavi.**\                                      |
| LORD, I call upon thee; haste thee unto me, \* and consider my voice, |
| when I cry unto thee.\                                                |
| 2 Let my prayer be set forth in thy sight as the incense; \* and let  |
| the lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice.\                  |
| 3 Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth, \* and keep the door of my    |
| lips.\                                                                |
| 4 O let not mine heart be inclined to any evil thing; \* let me not   |
| be occupied in ungodly works with the men that work wickedness,       |
| neither let me eat of such things as please them.\                    |
| 5 Let the righteous rather smite me friendly, and reprove me; \* yea, |
| let not my head refuse their precious balms.\                         |
| 6 As for the ungodly, \* I will pray yet against their wickedness.\   |
| 7 Let their judges be overthrown in stony places, \* that they may    |
| hear my words; for they are sweet.\                                   |

| breaketh and heweth wood upon the earth.\                             |
| 9 But mine eyes look unto thee, O LORD God; \* in thee is my trust; O |
| cast not out my soul.\                                                |
| 10 Keep me from the snare that they have laid for me, \* and from the |
| traps of the wicked doers.\                                           |

| Psalm 142. Voce mea ad Dominum.**\                                    |
| I CRIED unto the LORD with my voice; \* yea, even unto the LORD did I |
| make my supplication.\                                                |
| 2 I poured out my complaints before him, \* and showed him of my      |
| trouble.\                                                             |
| 3 When my spirit was in heaviness, thou knewest my path; \* in the    |
| way wherein I walked, have they privily laid a snare for me.\         |
| 4 I looked also upon my right hand, \* and saw there was no man that  |
| would know me.\                                                       |
| 5 I had no place to flee unto, \* and no man cared for my soul.\      |
| 6 I cried unto thee, O LORD, and said, \* Thou art my hope, and my    |
| portion in the land of the living.\                                   |
| 7 Consider my complaint; \* for I am brought very low.\               |
| 8 O deliver me from my persecutors; \* for they are too strong for    |
| me.\                                                                  |
| 9 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks unto thy Name;  |
| \* which thing if thou wilt grant me, then shall the righteous resort |
| unto my company.\                                                     |

| Psalm 143. Domine, exaudi.**\                                         |
| HEAR my prayer, O LORD, and consider my desire; \* hearken unto me    |
| for thy truth and righteousness\' sake.\                              |
| 2 And enter not into judgment with thy servant; \* for in thy sight   |
| shall no man living be justified.\                                    |
| 3 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down |
| to the ground; \* he hath laid me in the darkness, as the men that    |
| have been long dead.\                                                 |
| 4 Therefore is my spirit vexed within me, \* and my heart within me   |
| is desolate.\                                                         |
| 5 Yet do I remember the time past; I muse upon all thy works; \* yea, |
| I exercise myself in the works of thy hands.\                         |
| 6 I stretch forth my hands unto thee; \* my soul gaspeth unto thee as |
| a thirsty land.\                                                      |
| 7 Hear me, O LORD, and that soon; for my spirit waxeth faint: \* hide |
| not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the  |
| pit.\                                                                 |
| 8 O let me hear thy loving-kindness betimes in the morning; for in    |
| thee is my trust: \* show thou me the way that I should walk in; for  |
| I lift up my soul unto thee.\                                         |
| 9 Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies; \* for I flee unto thee to   |
| hide me.\                                                             |
| 10 Teach me to do the thing that pleaseth thee; for thou art my God:  |
| \* let thy loving Spirit lead me forth into the land of               |
| righteousness.\                                                       |
| 11 Quicken me, O LORD, for thy Name\'s sake; \* and for thy           |
| righteousness\' sake bring my soul out of trouble.\                   |
| 12 And of thy goodness slay mine enemies, \* and destroy all them     |
| that vex my soul; for I am thy servant.                               |
