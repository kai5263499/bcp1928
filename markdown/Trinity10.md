| 13 For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not  |
| to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the          |
| righteousness of faith.\                                              |
| 14 For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and |
| the promise made of none effect:\                                     |

| of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is |
| the father of us all,\                                                |

| calleth those things which be not as though they were.\               |

| strong in faith, giving glory to God;\                                |
| 21 And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able  |

| 1 And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before       |
| Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin |
| before thy father, that he seeketh my life?\                          |
| 2 And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my    |
| father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will show   |
| it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not    |
| so.\                                                                  |
| 3 And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth    |
| that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan |
| know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the LORD liveth, and as   |
| thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.\           |
| 4 Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will |
| even do it for thee.\                                                 |
| 5 And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and |
| I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I |
| may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.\             |
| 6 If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave |
| of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there is a yearly  |
| sacrifice there for all the family.\                                  |
| 7 If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he |
| be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him.\          |
| 12 And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have    |
| sounded my father about tomorrow any time, or the third day, and,     |
| behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, |
| and show it thee;\                                                    |
| 13 The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my      |
| father to do thee evil, then I will show it thee, and send thee away, |
| that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with thee, as he hath   |
| been with my father.\                                                 |
| 14 And thou shalt not only while yet I live show me the kindness of   |
| the LORD, that I die not:\                                            |
| 15 But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for     |
| ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every   |
| one from the face of the earth.\                                      |
| 16 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let   |
| the LORD even require it at the hand of David\'s enemies.\            |
| 17 And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him:    |
| for he loved him as he loved his own soul.\                           |
| 18 Then Jonathan said to David, Tomorrow is the new moon: and thou    |
| shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.\                     |
| 19 And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down      |
| quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the |
| business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.\            |
| 20 And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I     |
| shot at a mark.\                                                      |
| 21 And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows.   |
| If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side  |
| of thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and   |
| no hurt; as the LORD liveth.\                                         |
| 22 But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are       |
| beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.\           |
| 23 And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of,        |
| behold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever.\                    |

| 11 And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus     |
| Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.\                  |
| 12 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by  |
| sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:\     |
| 13 (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed    |
| when there is no law.\                                                |
| 14 Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that |
| had not sinned after the similitude of Adam\'s transgression, who is  |
| the figure of him that was to come.\                                  |
| 15 But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through   |
| the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the  |
| gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto  |
| many.\                                                                |
| 16 And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the      |
| judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many     |
| offences unto justification.\                                         |
| 17 For if by one man\'s offence death reigned by one; much more they  |
| which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness     |
| shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)\                           |
| 18 Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to   |
| condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came  |
| upon all men unto justification of life.\                             |
| 19 For as by one man\'s disobedience many were made sinners, so by    |
| the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.\                   |
| 20 Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where |
| sin abounded, grace did much more abound:\                            |
| 21 That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign     |
| through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.\    |

| the king sat him down to eat meat.\                                   |
| 25 And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a     |
| seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul\'s side,  |

| yesterday, nor today?\                                                |

| go to Bethlehem:\                                                     |
| 29 And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a         |
| sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be     |
| there: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get      |

| 30 Then Saul\'s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto  |
| him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that    |
| thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto    |
| the confusion of thy mother\'s nakedness?\                            |
| 31 For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt |
| not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him |
| unto me, for he shall surely die.\                                    |
| 32 And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him,          |
| Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?\                      |
| 33 And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew |
| that it was determined of his father to slay David.\                  |
| 34 So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no   |
| meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David,       |
| because his father had done him shame.\                               |
| 35 And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into    |
| the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with     |
| him.\                                                                 |

| shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.\              |
| 37 And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan |
| had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow    |

| 9 Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man    |
| planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a   |
| far country for a long time.\                                         |
| 10 And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they   |
| should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat |
| him, and sent him away empty.\                                        |
| 11 And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and     |
| entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.\                   |
| 12 And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast him |
| out.\                                                                 |
| 13 Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send   |
| my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him.\ |
| 14 But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves,   |
| saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance |
| may be ours.\                                                         |
| 15 So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What         |
| therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?\               |
| 16 He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the     |
| vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.\   |
| 17 And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written,   |
| The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of |
| the corner?\                                                          |
| 18 Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on       |
| whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.\               |
| 19 And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay  |
| hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he  |
| had spoken this parable against them.\                                |
| 20 And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign     |
| themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so  |
| they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.\ |
| 21 And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and   |
| teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but       |
| teachest the way of God truly:\                                       |
| 22 Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?\           |
| 23 But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt   |
| ye me?\                                                               |
| 24 Show me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They      |
| answered and said, Caesar\'s.\                                        |
| 25 And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things     |
| which be Caesar\'s, and unto God the things which be God\'s.\         |

| 5 For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death,  |
| we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:\                |
| 6 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body |
| of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.\  |
| 7 For he that is dead is freed from sin.\                             |

| 10 For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, |
| he liveth unto God.\                                                  |
| 11 Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but |
| alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.\                        |
| 12 Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should    |
| obey it in the lusts thereof.\                                        |
| 13 Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness    |
| unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from |
| the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.\ |
| 14 For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the |
| law, but under grace.\                                                |
| 15 What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but     |
| under grace? God forbid.\                                             |
| 16 Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey,    |
| his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of |
| obedience unto righteousness?\                                        |
| 17 But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have  |
| obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.\ |
| 18 Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of           |
| righteousness.\                                                       |
| 19 I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your   |
| flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness    |
| and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members         |
| servants to righteousness unto holiness.\                             |
| 20 For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from            |
| righteousness.\                                                       |
| 21 What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? |
| for the end of those things is death.\                                |
| 22 But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye   |
| have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.\         |
| 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life |

| gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.\                        |
| 11 Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of        |
| Ahitub, and all his father\'s house, the priests that were in Nob:    |
| and they came all of them to the king.\                               |
| 12 And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here |
| I am, my lord.\                                                       |
| 13 And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and |
| the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and |
| hast inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie  |
| in wait, as at this day?\                                             |
| 14 Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful |
| among all thy servants as David, which is the king\'s son-in-law, and |
| goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine house?\              |
| 15 Did I then begin to inquire of God for him? be it far from me: let |
| not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house  |
| of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or       |
| more.\                                                                |
| 16 And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all |
| thy father\'s house.\                                                 |
| 17 And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and |
| slay the priests of the LORD; because their hand also is with David,  |
| and because they knew when he fled, and did not show it to me. But    |
| the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon  |
| the priests of the LORD.\                                             |
| 18 And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests.   |
| And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew   |
| on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.\  |
| 19 And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the    |
| sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and      |
| asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.\                        |
| 20 And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named          |
| Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.\                             |
| 21 And Abiathar showed David that Saul had slain the LORD\'S          |
| priests.\                                                             |
| 22 And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the    |
| Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned  |
| the death of all the persons of thy father\'s house.\                 |

| 27 Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there   |
| is any resurrection; and they asked him,\                             |
| 28 Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man\'s brother die,    |
| having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should   |
| take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.\                   |
| 29 There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife,    |
| and died without children.\                                           |
| 30 And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.\           |
| 31 And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and     |
| they left no children, and died.\                                     |
| 32 Last of all the woman died also.\                                  |
| 33 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven |
| had her to wife.\                                                     |
| 34 And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world     |
| marry, and are given in marriage:\                                    |
| 35 But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and |
| the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in       |
| marriage:\                                                            |
| 36 Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; |
| and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.\ |
| 37 Now that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when  |
| he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the |
| God of Jacob.\                                                        |

| 1 Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how |
| that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?\          |
| 2 For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her      |

| loosed from the law of her husband.\                                  |
| 3 So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another     |

| she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she   |
| be married to another man.\                                           |
| 4 Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the   |
| body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who |
| is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.\  |
| 5 For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by   |
| the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.\    |
| 6 But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we   |
| were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the  |
| oldness of the letter.\                                               |

| 1 Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits,   |
| as the grapegleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat: my  |
| soul desired the firstripe fruit.\                                    |
| 2 The good man is perished out of the earth: and there is none        |
| upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every    |
| man his brother with a net.\                                          |
| 3 That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, |
| and the judge asketh for a reward; and the great man, he uttereth his |
| mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.\                              |
| 4 The best of them is as a brier: the most upright is sharper than a  |
| thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation cometh; now   |
| shall be their perplexity.\                                           |
| 5 Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep    |
| the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.\             |
| 6 For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against |
| her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man\'s   |
| enemies are the men of his own house.\                                |
| 7 Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God of my  |
| salvation: my God will hear me.\                                      |
| 8 Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise;   |
| when I sit in darkness, the LORD shall be a light unto me.\           |
| 9 I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned      |
| against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he |
| will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his              |

| had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.\              |
| 4 And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and      |
| pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they    |
| pitched in Giboa.\                                                    |

| his heart greatly trembled.\                                          |

| neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.\                     |
| 7 Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a       |

| servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar   |

| 8 And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went,  |
| and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he     |
| said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring   |
| me him up, whom I shall name unto thee.\                              |

| life, to cause me to die?\                                            |
| 10 And Saul sware to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth,     |
| there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.\             |
| 11 Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, |
| Bring me up Samuel.\                                                  |

| And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.\ |
| 14 And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man |
| cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that   |
| it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed  |
| himself.\                                                             |
| 15 And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me  |
| up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make |
| war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no      |
| more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called     |
| thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.\           |

| 1 There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ  |
| Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.\           |
| 2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free |
| from the law of sin and death.\                                       |
| 3 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the      |

| for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:\                                 |
| 4 That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who     |

| Spirit is life because of righteousness.\                             |
| 11 But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell  |

| the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.\          |
| 14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of  |
| God.\                                                                 |
| 15 For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but  |
| ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,        |
| Father.\                                                              |
| 16 The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the |
| children of God:\                                                     |
| 17 And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with    |
| Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also         |
| glorified together.\                                                  |
