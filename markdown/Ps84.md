| **Psalm 84. Quam dilecta!**\                                          |
| O HOW amiable are thy dwellings, \* thou LORD of hosts!\              |
| 2 My soul hath a desire and longing to enter into the courts of the   |
| LORD; \* my heart and my flesh rejoice in the living God.\            |
| 3 Yea, the sparrow hath found her an house, and the swallow a nest,   |
| where she may lay her young; \* even thy altars, O LORD of hosts, my  |
| King and my God.\                                                     |
| 4 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house; \* they will be alway     |
| praising thee.\                                                       |
| 5 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; \* in whose heart are |
| thy ways.\                                                            |
| 6 Who going through the vale of misery use it for a well; \* and the  |
| pools are filled with water.\                                         |
| 7 They will go from strength to strength, \* and unto the God of gods |
| appeareth every one of them in Sion.\                                 |
| 8 O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; \* hearken, O God of Jacob.\   |
| 9 Behold, O God our defender, \* and look upon the face of thine      |
| anointed.\                                                            |
| 10 For one day in thy courts \* is better than a thousand.\           |
| 11 I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God, \* than to   |
| dwell in the tents of ungodliness.\                                   |
| 12 For the LORD God is a light and defence; \* the LORD will give     |
| grace and worship; and no good thing shall he withhold from them that |
| live a godly life.\                                                   |
| 13 O LORD God of hosts, \* blessed is the man that putteth his trust  |
| in thee.                                                              |
