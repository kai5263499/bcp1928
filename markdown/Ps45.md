| **Psalms 45. Eructavit cor meum.**\                                   |
| MY heart overfloweth with a good matter; I speak the things which I   |
| have made concerning the King. \* My tongue is the pen of a ready     |
| writer.\                                                              |
| 2 Thou art fairer than the children of men; \* full of grace are thy  |
| lips, because God hath blessed thee for ever.\                        |
| 3 Gird thee with thy sword upon thy thigh, O thou Most Mighty, \*     |
| according to thy worship and renown.\                                 |
| 4 Good luck have thou with thine honour: \* ride on, because of the   |
| word of truth, of meekness, and righteousness; and thy right hand     |
| shall teach thee terrible things.\                                    |
| 5 Thy arrows are very sharp in the heart of the King\'s enemies, \*   |
| and the people shall be subdued unto thee.\                           |
| 6 Thy seat, O God, endureth for ever; \* the sceptre of thy kingdom   |
| is a right sceptre.\                                                  |
| 7 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; \* wherefore     |
| God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above  |
| thy fellows.\                                                         |
| 8 All thy garments smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia; \* out of the   |
| ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.\                     |
| 9 Kings\' daughters are among thy honourable women; \* upon thy right |
| hand doth stand the queen in a vesture of gold, wrought about with    |
| divers colours.\                                                      |
| 10 Hearken, O daughter, and consider; incline thine ear; \* forget    |
| also thine own people, and thy father\'s house.\                      |
| 11 So shall the King have pleasure in thy beauty; \* for he is thy    |
| Lord, and worship thou him.\                                          |
| 12 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; \* like as    |
| the rich also among the people shall make their supplication before   |
| thee.\                                                                |
| 13 The King\'s daughter is all glorious within; \* her clothing is of |
| wrought gold.\                                                        |
| 14 She shall be brought unto the King in raiment of needlework: \*    |
| the virgins that be her fellows shall bear her company, and shall be  |
| brought unto thee.\                                                   |
| 15 With joy and gladness shall they be brought, \* and shall enter    |
| into the King\'s palace.\                                             |
| 16 Instead of thy fathers, thou shalt have children, \* whom thou     |
| mayest make princes in all lands.\                                    |
| 17 I will make thy Name to be remembered from one generation to       |
| another; \* therefore shall the people give thanks unto thee, world   |
| without end.                                                          |
