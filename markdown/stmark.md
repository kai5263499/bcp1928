| O ALMIGHTY God, who hast instructed thy holy Church with the heavenly |
| doctrine of thy Evangelist Saint Mark; Give us grace that, being not  |
| like children carried away with every blast of vain doctrine, we may  |
| be established in the truth of thy holy Gospel; through Jesus Christ  |
| our Lord. Amen.\                                                      |
|                                                                       |
| The Epistle. Ephesians 4:7-16                                         |
|                                                                       |
| 7 But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of |
| the gift of Christ.\                                                  |
| 8 Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity   |
| captive, and gave gifts unto men.\                                    |
| 9 (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first  |
| into the lower parts of the earth?\                                   |
| 10 He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all  |
| heavens, that he might fill all things.)\                             |
| 11 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some,          |
| evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;\                         |
| 12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry,    |
| for the edifying of the body of Christ:\                              |
| 13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge   |
| of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the        |
| stature of the fulness of Christ:\                                    |
| 14 That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and     |
| carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and |
| cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;\             |
| 15 But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all        |
| things, which is the head, even Christ:\                              |
| 16 From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by    |
| that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working  |
| in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the    |
| edifying of itself in love.\                                          |
|                                                                       |
| The Gospel. St. John 15:1 - 11                                        |
|                                                                       |
| 1 I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.\               |
| 2 Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every |
| branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth     |
| more fruit.\                                                          |
| 3 Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.\    |
| 4 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of       |
| itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide  |
| in me.\                                                               |
| 5 I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in |
| him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do     |
| nothing.\                                                             |
| 6 If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is      |
| withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they  |
| are burned.\                                                          |
| 7 If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye  |
| will, and it shall be done unto you.\                                 |
| 8 Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye |
| be my disciples.\                                                     |
| 9 As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my |
| love.\                                                                |
| 10 If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I   |
| have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.\           |
| 11 These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in   |
| you, and that your joy might be full.                                 |
|                                                                       |
