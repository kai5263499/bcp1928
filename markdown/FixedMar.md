| 1 Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which   |
| the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God      |
| said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?\                  |
| 2 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the |
| trees of the garden:\                                                 |
| 3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden,   |
| God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it,     |
| lest ye die.\                                                         |
| 4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:\      |
| 5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes    |
| shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.\     |
| 6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it |
| was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise,  |
| she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her    |
| husband with her; and he did eat.\                                    |
| 7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were |
| naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves        |
| aprons.\                                                              |
| 8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in   |
| the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the    |
| presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.\            |
| 9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art     |
| thou?\                                                                |
| 10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid,    |
| because I was naked; and I hid myself.\                               |
| 11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten   |
| of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?\   |
| 12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she    |
| gave me of the tree, and I did eat.\                                  |
| 13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast  |
| done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.\    |
| 14 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done     |
| this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the  |
| field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the  |
| days of thy life:\                                                    |
| 15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy  |
| seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise    |
| his heel.\                                                            |

| Romans 5:12-21**\                                                     |
| 12 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by  |
| sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:\     |
| 13 (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed    |
| when there is no law.\                                                |
| 14 Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that |
| had not sinned after the similitude of Adam\'s transgression, who is  |
| the figure of him that was to come.\                                  |
| 15 But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through   |
| the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the  |
| gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto  |
| many.\                                                                |
| 16 And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the      |
| judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many     |
| offences unto justification.\                                         |
| 17 For if by one man\'s offence death reigned by one; much more they  |
| which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness     |
| shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)\                           |
| 18 Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to   |
| condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came  |
| upon all men unto justification of life.\                             |
| []{#anchor511000}19 For as by one man\'s disobedience many were made  |
| sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.\    |
| 20 Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where |
| sin abounded, grace did much more abound:\                            |
| 21 That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign     |
| through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.\    |

| 5 For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to      |
| come, whereof we speak.\                                              |
| 6 But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that     |
| thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?\  |
| 7 Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him  |
| with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy        |
| hands:\                                                               |
| 8 Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that  |
| he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put   |
| under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.\          |
| 9 But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for   |
| the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the |
| grace of God should taste death for every man.\                       |
| 10 For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all    |
| things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of      |
| their salvation perfect through sufferings.\                          |
| 11 For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all   |
| of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,\     |
| 12 Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of  |
| the church will I sing praise unto thee.\                             |
| 13 And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the |
| children which God hath given me.\                                    |
| 14 Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood,   |
| he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he |
| might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;\   |
| 15 And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime |
| subject to bondage.\                                                  |
| 16 For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on |
| him the seed of Abraham.\                                             |
| 17 Wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his   |
| brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in     |
| things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the  |

| Matthew 1:18-23**\                                                    |
| 18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother |
| Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found |
| with child of the Holy Ghost.\                                        |
| 19 Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make |
| her a public example, was minded to put her away privily.\            |
| 20 But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the     |
| Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, |
| fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived |
| in her is of the Holy Ghost.\                                         |
| 21 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name      |
| JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.\                 |
| 22 Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken |
| of the Lord by the prophet, saying,\                                  |
| 23 Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, |
| and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is,    |
| God with us.\                                                         |
