| **Psalm 61. Exaudi, Deus.**\                                          |
| HEAR my crying, O God, \* give ear unto my prayer.\                   |
| 2 From the ends of the earth will I call upon thee, \* when my heart  |
| is in heaviness.\                                                     |
| 3 O set me up upon the rock that is higher than I; \* for thou hast   |
| been my hope, and a strong tower for me against the enemy.\           |
| 4 I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever, \* and my trust shall be   |
| under the covering of thy wings.\                                     |
| 5 For thou, O Lord, hast heard my desires, \* and hast given an       |
| heritage unto those that fear thy Name.\                              |
| 6 Thou shalt grant the King a long life, \* that his years may endure |
| throughout all generations.\                                          |
| 7 He shall dwell before God for ever: \* O prepare thy loving mercy   |
| and faithfulness, that they may preserve him.\                        |
| 8 So will I alway sing praise unto thy Name, \* that I may daily      |
| perform my vows.                                                      |
