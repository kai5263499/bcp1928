**Psalm 71. In te, Domine, speravi.**\
IN thee, O LORD, have I put my trust; let me never be put to confusion,
\* but rid me and deliver me in thy righteousness; incline thine ear
unto me, and save me.\
2 Be thou my stronghold, whereunto I may alway resort: \* thou hast
promised to help me, for thou art my house of defence, and my castle.\
3 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the ungodly, \* out of the
hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.\
4 For thou, O Lord GOD, art the thing that I long for: \* thou art my
hope, even from my youth.\
5 Through thee have I been holden up ever since I was born: \* thou art
he that took me out of my mother\'s womb: my praise shall be alway of
thee.\
6 I am become as it were a monster unto many, \* but my sure trust is in
thee.\
7 O let my mouth be filled with thy praise, \* that I may sing of thy
glory and honour all the day long.\
8 Cast me not away in the time of age; \* forsake me not when my
strength faileth me.\
9 For mine enemies speak against me; \* and they that lay wait for my
soul take their counsel together, saying,\
10 God hath forsaken him; \* persecute him, and take him, for there is
none to deliver him.\
11 Go not far from me, O God; \* my God, haste thee to help me.\
12 Let them be confounded and perish that are against my soul; \* let
them be covered with shame and dishonour that seek to do me evil.\
13 As for me, I will patiently abide alway, \* and will praise thee more
and more.\
14 My mouth shall daily speak of thy righteousness and salvation; \* for
I know no end thereof.\
15 I will go forth in the strength of the Lord GOD, \* and will make
mention of thy righteousness only.\
16 Thou, O God, hast taught me from my youth up until now; \* therefore
will I tell of thy wondrous works.\
17 Forsake me not, O God, in mine old age, when I am gray-headed, \*
until I have showed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to
all them that are yet for to come.\
18 Thy righteousness, O God, is very high, \* and great things are they
that thou hast done: O God, who is like unto thee!\
19 O what great troubles and adversities hast thou showed me ! and yet
didst thou turn and refresh me; \* yea, and broughtest me from the deep
of the earth again.\
20 Thou hast brought me to great honour, \* and comforted me on every
side:\
21 Therefore will I praise thee, and thy faithfulness, O God, playing
upon an instrument of music: \* unto thee will I sing upon the harp, O
thou Holy One of Israel.\
22 My lips will be glad when I sing unto thee; \* and so will my soul
whom thou hast delivered.\
23 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long; \*
for they are confounded and brought unto shame that seek to do me evil.\

**Psalm 72. Deus, judicium.**\
GIVE the King thy judgments, O God, \* and thy righteousness unto the
King\'s son.\
2 Then shall he judge thy people according unto right, \* and defend the
poor.\
3 The mountains also shall bring peace, \* and the little hills
righteousness unto the people.\
4 He shall keep the simple folk by their right, \* defend the children
of the poor, and punish the wrong doer.\
5 They shall fear thee, as long as the sun and moon endureth, \* from
one generation to another.\
6 He shall come down like the rain upon the mown grass, \* even as the
drops that water the earth.\
7 In his time shall the righteous flourish; \* yea, and abundance of
peace, so long as the moon endureth.\
8 His dominion shall be also from the one sea to the other, \* and from
the River unto the world\'s end.\
9 They that dwell in the wilderness shall kneel before him; \* his
enemies shall lick the dust.\
10 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall give presents; \* the
kings of Arabia and Saba shall bring gifts.\
11 All kings shall fall down before him; \* all nations shall do him
service.\
12 For he shall deliver the poor when he crieth; \* the needy also, and
him that hath no helper.\
13 He shall be favourable to the simple and needy, \* and shall preserve
the souls of the poor.\
14 He shall deliver their souls from falsehood and wrong; \* and dear
shall their blood be in his sight.\
15 He shall live, and unto him shall be given of the gold of Arabia; \*
prayer shall be made ever unto him, and daily shall he be praised.\
16 There shall be an heap of corn in the earth, high upon the hills ;
the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: \* and they of the city
shall flourish like grass upon the earth.\
17 His Name shall endure for ever; his Name shall remain under the sun
among the posterities, which shall be blessed in him; \* and all the
nations shall praise him.\
18 Blessed be the LORD God, even the God of Israel, \* which only doeth
wondrous things;\
19 And blessed be the Name of his majesty for ever: \* and all the earth
shall be filled with his majesty. Amen, Amen.
