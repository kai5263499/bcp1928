**Psalm 119. (Cont)\
XIV. Lucerna pedibus meis.**\
THY word is a lantern unto my feet, \* and a light unto my paths.\
106 I have sworn, and am stedfastly purposed, \* to keep thy righteous
judgments.\
107 I am troubled above measure: \* quicken me, O LORD, according to thy
word.\
108 Let the free-will offerings of my mouth please thee, O LORD; \* and
teach me thy judgments.\
109 My soul is alway in my hand; \* yet do I not forget thy law.\
110 The ungodly have laid a snare for me; \* but yet I swerved not from
thy commandments.\
111 Thy testimonies have I claimed as mine heritage for ever; \* and
why? they are the very joy of my heart.\
112 I have applied my heart to fulfil thy statutes alway, \* even unto
the end.\

**XV. Iniquos odio habui.**\
I HATE them that imagine evil things; \* but thy law do I love.\
114 Thou art my defence and shield; \* and my trust is in thy word.\
115 Away from me, ye wicked; \* I will keep the commandments of my God.\
116 O stablish me according to thy word, that I may live; \* and let me
not be disappointed of my hope.\
117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe; \* yea, my delight shall be
ever in thy statutes.\
118 Thou hast trodden down all them that depart from thy statutes; \*
for they imagine but deceit.\
119 Thou puttest away all the ungodly of the earth like dross; \*
therefore I love thy testimonies.\
120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; \* and I am afraid of thy
judgments.\

**XVI. Feci judicium.**\
I DEAL with the thing that is lawful and right; \* O give me not over
unto mine oppressors.\
122 Make thou thy servant to delight in that which is good, \* that the
proud do me no wrong.\
123 Mine eyes are wasted away with looking for thy health, \* and for
the word of thy righteousness.\
124 O deal with thy servant according unto thy loving mercy, \* and
teach me thy statutes.\
125 I am thy servant; O grant me understanding, \* that I may know thy
testimonies.\
126 It is time for thee, LORD, to lay to thine hand; \* for they have
destroyed thy law.\
127 For I love thy commandments \* above gold and precious stones.\
128 Therefore hold I straight all thy commandments; \* and all false
ways I utterly abhor.\

**XVII. Mirabilia.**\
THY testimonies are wonderful; \* therefore doth my soul keep them.\
130 When thy word goeth forth, \* it giveth light and understanding unto
the simple.\
131 I opened my mouth, and drew in my breath; \* for my delight was in
thy commandments.\
132 O look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, \* as thou usest to do
unto those that love thy Name.\
133 Order my steps in thy word; \* and so shall no wickedness have
dominion over me.\
134 O deliver me from the wrongful dealings of men; \* and so shall I
keep thy commandments.\
135 Show the light of thy countenance upon thy servant, \* and teach me
thy statutes.\
136 Mine eyes gush out with water, \* because men keep not thy law.\

**XVIII. Justus es, Domine.**\
RIGHTEOUS art thou, O LORD; \* and true are thy judgments.\
138 The testimonies that thou hast commanded \* are exceeding righteous
and true.\
139 My zeal hath even consumed me; \* because mine enemies have
forgotten thy words.\
140 Thy word is tried to the uttermost, \* and thy servant loveth it.\
141 I am small and of no reputation; \* yet do I not forget thy
commandments.\
142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, \* and thy law is
the truth.\
143 Trouble and heaviness have taken hold upon me; \* yet is my delight
in thy commandments.\
144 The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: \* O grant me
understanding, and I shall live.
