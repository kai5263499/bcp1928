###### * ¶ Then shall the Minister, and the People with him, say the Lord\'s Prayer.*

\
Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive those who
trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us
from evil. Amen.

######  *¶ The Minister may, at his discretion, omit all that followeth, to the Prayer,* We humbly beseech thee, O Father, etc.

\
O Lord, deal not with us according to our sins. **\
Neither reward us according to our iniquities.**\
\
Let us pray.\
O God, merciful Father, who despisest not the sighing of a contrite
heart, nor the desire of such as are sorrowful; Mercifully assist our
prayers which we make before thee in all our troubles and adversities,
whensoever they oppress us; and graciously hear us, that those evils
which the craft and subtilty of the devil or man worketh against us,
may, by thy good providence, be brought to nought; that we thy servants,
being hurt by no persecutions, may evermore give thanks unto thee in thy
holy Church; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\
\
¶ Minister and People.\
**O Lord, arise, help us, and deliver us for thy Name\'s sake.**\
\
Minister.\
O God, we have heard with our ears, and our fathers have declared unto
us, the noble works that thou didst in their days, and in the old time
before them.\
\
¶ Minister and People.\
**O Lord, arise, help us, and deliver us for thine honour.**\
\
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost; **\
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without
end. Amen.**\
From our enemies defend us, O Christ. **\
Graciously look upon our afflictions.**\
With pity behold the sorrows of our hearts. **\
Mercifully forgive the sins of thy people.**\
Favourably with mercy hear our prayers. **\
O Son of David, have mercy upon us.**\
Both now and ever vouchsafe to hear us, O Christ. **\
Graciously hear us, O Christ; graciously hear us, O Lord Christ.**\
\
O Lord, let thy mercy be showed upon us;\
**As we do put our trust in thee.**\
\
Let us pray.\
We humbly beseech thee, O Father, mercifully to look upon our
infirmities; and, for the glory of thy Name, turn from us all those
evils that we most justly have deserved; and grant, that in all our
troubles we may put our whole trust and confidence in thy mercy, and
evermore serve thee in holiness and pureness of living, to thy honour
and glory; through our only Mediator and Advocate, Jesus Christ our
Lord. Amen.\
