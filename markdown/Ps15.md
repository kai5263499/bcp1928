| **Psalms 15 . Domine, quis habitabit?**\                              |
| LORD, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? \* or who shall rest upon    |
| thy holy hill?\                                                       |
| 2 Even he that leadeth an uncorrupt life, \* and doeth the thing      |
| which is right, and speaketh the truth from his heart.\               |
| 3 He that hath used no deceit in his tongue, nor done evil to his     |
| neighbour, \* and hath not slandered his neighbour.\                  |
| 4 He that setteth not by himself, but is lowly in his own eyes, \*    |
| and maketh much of them that fear the LORD.\                          |
| 5 He that sweareth unto his neighbour, and disappointeth him not, \*  |
| though it were to his own hindrance.\                                 |
| 6 He that hath not given his money upon usury, \* nor taken reward    |
| against the innocent.\                                                |
| 7 Whoso doeth these things \* shall never fall.                       |
