| **Psalm 116. Dilexi, quoniam.**\                                      |
| MY delight is in the LORD; \* because he hath heard the voice of my   |
| prayer;\                                                              |
| 2 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me; \* therefore will I call  |
| upon him as long as I live.\                                          |
| 3 The snares of death compassed me round about, \* and the pains of   |
| hell gat hold upon me.\                                               |
| 4 I found trouble and heaviness; then called I upon the Name of the   |
| LORD; \* O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.\                    |
| 5 Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; \* yea, our God is merciful.\  |
| 6 The LORD preserveth the simple: \* I was in misery, and he helped   |
| me.\                                                                  |
| 7 Turn again then unto thy rest, O my soul; \* for the LORD hath      |
| rewarded thee.\                                                       |
| 8 And why? thou hast delivered my soul from death, \* mine eyes from  |
| tears, and my feet from falling.\                                     |
| 9 I will walk before the LORD \* in the land of the living.\          |
| 10 I believed, and therefore will I speak; but I was sore troubled:   |
| \* I said in my haste, All men are liars.\                            |
| 11 What reward shall I give unto the LORD \* for all the benefits     |
| that he hath done unto me?\                                           |
| 12 I will receive the cup of salvation, \* and call upon the Name of  |
| the LORD.\                                                            |
| 13 I will pay my vows now in the presence of all his people: \* right |
| dear in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.\            |
| 14 Behold, O LORD, how that I am thy servant; \* I am thy servant,    |
| and the son of thine handmaid; thou hast broken my bonds in sunder.\  |
| 15 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, \* and will    |
| call upon the Name of the LORD.\                                      |
| 16 I will pay my vows unto the LORD, in the sight of all his people,  |
| \* in the courts of the LORD\'S house; even in the midst of thee, O   |
| Jerusalem. Praise the LORD.                                           |
