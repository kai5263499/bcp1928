| **Psalm 122. Laetatus sum.**\                                         |
| I WAS glad when they said unto me, \* We will go into the house of    |
| the LORD.\                                                            |
| 2 Our feet shall stand in thy gates, \* O Jerusalem.\                 |
| 3 Jerusalem is built as a city \* that is at unity in itself.\        |
| 4 For thither the tribes go up, even the tribes of the LORD, \* to    |
| testify unto Israel, to give thanks unto the Name of the LORD.\       |
| 5 For there is the seat of judgment, \* even the seat of the house of |
| David.\                                                               |
| 6 O pray for the peace of Jerusalem; \* they shall prosper that love  |
| thee.\                                                                |
| 7 Peace be within thy walls, \* and plenteousness within thy          |
| palaces.\                                                             |
| 8 For my brethren and companions\' sakes, \* I will wish thee         |
| prosperity.\                                                          |
| 9 Yea, because of the house of the LORD our God, \* I will seek to do |
| thee good.                                                            |
