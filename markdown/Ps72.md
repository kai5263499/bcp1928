| **Psalm 72. Deus, judicium.**\                                        |
| GIVE the King thy judgments, O God, \* and thy righteousness unto the |
| King\'s son.\                                                         |
| 2 Then shall he judge thy people according unto right, \* and defend  |
| the poor.\                                                            |
| 3 The mountains also shall bring peace, \* and the little hills       |
| righteousness unto the people.\                                       |
| 4 He shall keep the simple folk by their right, \* defend the         |
| children of the poor, and punish the wrong doer.\                     |
| 5 They shall fear thee, as long as the sun and moon endureth, \* from |
| one generation to another.\                                           |
| 6 He shall come down like the rain upon the mown grass, \* even as    |
| the drops that water the earth.\                                      |
| 7 In his time shall the righteous flourish; \* yea, and abundance of  |
| peace, so long as the moon endureth.\                                 |
| 8 His dominion shall be also from the one sea to the other, \* and    |
| from the River unto the world\'s end.\                                |
| 9 They that dwell in the wilderness shall kneel before him; \* his    |
| enemies shall lick the dust.\                                         |
| 10 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall give presents; \* the |
| kings of Arabia and Saba shall bring gifts.\                          |
| 11 All kings shall fall down before him; \* all nations shall do him  |
| service.\                                                             |
| 12 For he shall deliver the poor when he crieth; \* the needy also,   |
| and him that hath no helper.\                                         |
| 13 He shall be favourable to the simple and needy, \* and shall       |
| preserve the souls of the poor.\                                      |
| 14 He shall deliver their souls from falsehood and wrong; \* and dear |
| shall their blood be in his sight.\                                   |
| 15 He shall live, and unto him shall be given of the gold of Arabia;  |
| \* prayer shall be made ever unto him, and daily shall he be          |
| praised.\                                                             |
| 16 There shall be an heap of corn in the earth, high upon the hills ; |
| the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: \* and they of the city   |
| shall flourish like grass upon the earth.\                            |
| 17 His Name shall endure for ever; his Name shall remain under the    |
| sun among the posterities, which shall be blessed in him; \* and all  |
| the nations shall praise him.\                                        |
| 18 Blessed be the LORD God, even the God of Israel, \* which only     |
| doeth wondrous things;\                                               |
| 19 And blessed be the Name of his majesty for ever: \* and all the    |
| earth shall be filled with his majesty. Amen, Amen.                   |
