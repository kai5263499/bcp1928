| **Psalms 130. De profundis.\                                          |
| **OUT of the deep have I called unto thee, O LORD; \* Lord, hear my   |
| voice.\                                                               |
| 2 O let thine ears consider well \* the voice of my complaint.\       |
| 3 If thou, LORD, wilt be extreme to mark what is done amiss, \* O     |
| Lord, who may abide it?\                                              |
| 4 For there is mercy with thee; \* therefore shalt thou be feared.\   |
| 5 I look for the LORD; my soul doth wait for him; \* in his word is   |
| my trust.\                                                            |
| 6 My soul fleeth unto the Lord before the morning watch; \* I say,    |
| before the morning watch.\                                            |
| 7 O Israel, trust in the LORD; for with the LORD there is mercy, \*   |
| and with him is plenteous redemption.\                                |
| 8 And he shall redeem Israel \* from all his sins.                    |
