| **Psalm 82. Deus stetit.**\                                           |
| GOD standeth in the congregation of princes; \* he is a Judge among   |
| gods.\                                                                |
| 2 How long will ye give wrong judgment, \* and accept the persons of  |
| the ungodly?\                                                         |
| 3 Defend the poor and fatherless; \* see that such as are in need and |
| necessity have right.\                                                |
| 4 Deliver the outcast and poor; \* save them from the hand of the     |
| ungodly.\                                                             |
| 5 They know not, neither do they understand, but walk on still in     |
| darkness: \* all the foundations of the earth are out of course.\     |
| 6 I have said, Ye are gods, \* and ye are all the children of the     |
| Most Highest.\                                                        |
| 7 But ye shall die like men, \* and fall like one of the princes.\    |
| 8 Arise, O God, and judge thou the earth; \* for thou shalt take all  |
| nations to thine inheritance.                                         |
