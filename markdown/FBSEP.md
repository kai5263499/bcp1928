::: {align="center"}
[¶ This version of Evening Prayer - commonly called **The Sedona
Rite** - is in accordance with the rubrics of the 1928 Book of Common
Prayer. Various prayers have been consolidated into this Rite and all
are found in the BCP. The \"Prayer for All Conditions of Mankind\" is a
compilation of the Office\'s prayers, with additions coming from the
\"Family Prayer\" and \"Prayers\" sections of the BCP. The parts that
are bracketed and italicised indicate how the office can be shortened,
as necessary. We suggest the shortened version for those who are new to
the recitation of the office, and recommend the lengthening of the
prayers as you are able to do so.]{.style11}

CONFESSION

ALMIGHTY and most merciful Father; We have erred, and strayed from thy
ways like lost sheep. We have followed too much the devices and desires
of our own hearts. We have offended against thy holy laws. We have left
undone those things which we ought to have done; And we have done those
things which we ought not to have done; And there is no health in us.
But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us, miserable offenders. Spare thou
those, O God, who confess their faults. Restore thou those who are
penitent; According to thy promises declared unto mankind In Christ
Jesus our Lord. And grant, O most merciful Father, for his sake; That we
may hereafter live a godly, righteous, and sober life, To the glory of
thy holy Name. Amen.

**LORD'S PRAYER**

Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive those who
trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us
from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for
ever and ever. Amen.\
\
O Lord, open thou our lips.**\
And our mouth shall show forth thy praise.**\
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;**\
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without
end. Amen.**\
Praise ye the Lord.\
**The Lord\'s Name be praised.**

**Magnificat. St. Luke i. 46.**\

My soul doth magnify the Lord, \* and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my
Saviour.\
For he hath regarded \* the lowliness of his handmaiden.

For behold, from henceforth \* all generations shall call me blessed.\
For he that is mighty hath magnified me; \* and holy is his Name.\
And his mercy is on them that fear him \* throughout all generations.\
He hath showed strength with his arm; \* he hath scattered the proud in
the imagination of their hearts.\
He hath put down the mighty from their seat, \* and hath exalted the
humble and meek;\
He hath filled the hungry with good things; \* and the rich he hath sent
empty away.\
He remembering his mercy hath holpen his servant Israel; \* as he
promised to our forefathers, Abraham and his seed, for ever.\
GLORY be to the Father, and to the Son, \* and to the Holy Ghost;\
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, \* world without
end. Amen.

**Nunc dimittis. St. Luke ii. 29.\
**

LORD, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, \* according to thy
word.\
For mine eyes have seen \* thy salvation,\
Which thou hast prepared \* before the face of all people;\
To be a light to lighten the Gentiles, \* and to be the glory of thy
people Israel.\
GLORY be to the Father, and to the Son, \* and to the Holy Ghost;\
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, \* world without
end. Amen.

**\
The Apostles\' Creed.**

\
I Believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth:

And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord: Who was conceived by the Holy
Ghost, Born of the Virgin Mary: Suffered under Pontius Pilate, Was
crucified, dead, and buried: He descended into hell; The third day he
rose again from the dead: He ascended into heaven, And sitteth on the
right hand of God the Father Almighty: From thence he shall come to
judge the quick and the dead.

I believe in the Holy Ghost: The holy Catholic Church; The Communion of
Saints: The Forgiveness of sins: The Resurrection of the body: And the
Life + everlasting. Amen.

\
O Lord, show thy mercy upon us.\
**And grant us thy salvation.**\
O Lord, save the State.\
**And mercifully hear us when we call upon thee.**\
Endue thy Ministers with righteousness.\
**And make thy chosen people joyful.**\
O Lord, save thy people.\
**And bless thine inheritance.**\
Give peace in our time, O Lord.\
**For it is thou, Lord, only, that makest us dwell in safety.**\
O God, make clean our hearts within us.\
**And take not thy Holy Spirit from us.**\

**A Collect for Peace.**

O God, from whom all holy desires, all good counsels, and all just works
do proceed; Give unto thy servants that peace which the world cannot
give; that our hearts may be set to obey thy commandments, and also that
by thee, we, being defended from the fear of our enemies, may pass our
time in rest and quietness; through the merits of Jesus Christ our
Saviour. Amen.

\
\
**A Collect for Aid against Perils.**

Lighten our darkness, we beseech thee, O Lord; and by thy great mercy
defend us from all perils and dangers of this night; for the love of thy
only Son, our Saviour, Jesus Christ. Amen.

**A Prayer for all Conditions of Mankind**.\

O GOD, the Creator and Preserver of all mankind, we humbly beseech thee
for all sorts and conditions of men; that thou wouldest be pleased to
make thy ways known unto them, thy saving health unto all nations. Grant
to all in authority wisdom and strength to know and to do thy will. Fill
them with the love of truth and righteousness; and make them ever
mindful of their calling to serve the people in thy fear.

MORE especially we pray for thy holy Church universal. Send down upon
our Bishops, and other Clergy, and upon the Congregations committed to
their charge, the healthful Spirit of thy grace; and, that they may
truly please thee, pour upon them the continual dew of thy blessing \[,
*that thy Church may be so guided and governed by thy good Spirit, that
all who profess and call themselves Christians may be led into the way
of truth, and hold the faith in unity of spirit, in the bond of peace,
and in righteousness of life*\].

AND we commend to thy fatherly goodness all those who are any ways
afflicted, or distressed, in mind, body, or estate. \[*Remember in pity
such as are this day destitute, homeless, or forgotten of their
fellow-men. Bless the congregation of thy poor. Uplift those who are
cast down. Mightily befriend innocent sufferers, and sanctify to them
the endurance of their wrongs. Cheer with hope all discouraged and
unhappy people, and by thy heavenly grace preserve from falling those
whose poverty tempteth them to sin; though they be troubled on every
side, suffer them not to be distressed; though they be perplexed, save
them from despair. Pardon those who have done or wish us evil, and give
them repentance and better minds. Comfort and succour all prisoners,
especially those who are condemned to die. Give them a right
understanding of themselves, and of thy promises; that, trusting wholly
in thy mercy, they may not place their confidence anywhere but in thee.
Relieve the distressed, protect the innocent, awaken the guilty; and
forasmuch as thou alone bringest light out of darkness, and good out of
evil, grant to these thy servants, that by the power of thy Holy Spirit
they may be set free from the chains of sin, and may be brought to
newness of life.*\]\
\
AND be merciful, O Lord, to all whose duties are difficult or
burdensome, and comfort them concerning their toil. Protect the efforts
of sober and honest industry. Bless those who labour in works of mercy,
in schools of good learning, who care for the aged, little children, the
sick and the afflicted, and remember those who travel this day by land,
sea and air.

AND we beseech thee graciously to behold and bless those whom we love,
now absent from us. Defend them from all dangers of soul and body; and
grant that both they and we, drawing nearer to thee, may be bound
together by thy love in the communion of thy Holy Spirit, and in the
fellowship of all thy saints.

AND we do give thee most humble and hearty thanks for all thy goodness
and lovingkindness to us, and to all men; We bless thee for our
creation, preservation, and all the blessings of this life; but above
all, for thine inestimable love in the redemption of the world by our
Lord Jesus Christ; for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.

AND, we beseech thee, give us that due sense of all thy mercies, that
our hearts may be unfeignedly thankful; and that we show forth thy
praise, not only with our lips, but in our lives, by giving up our
selves to thy service, and by walking before thee in holiness and
righteousness all our days.

AND finally, we beseech thee to continue thy gracious protection to us
this night. Defend us from all dangers and mischiefs, and from the fear
of them; that we may enjoy such refreshing sleep as may fit us for the
duties of the coming day. And grant us grace always to live in such a
state that we may never be afraid to die; so that, living and dying, we
may be thine, through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom, with thee and the
Holy Ghost, be all honour and glory, world without end. Amen.

**A Prayer of St. Chrysostom.**\

Almighty God, who hast given us grace at this time with one accord to
make our common supplications unto thee; and dost promise that when two
or three are gathered together in thy Name thou wilt grant their
requests; Fulfil now, O Lord, the desires and petitions of thy servants,
as may be most expedient for them; granting us in this world knowledge
of thy truth, and in the world to come life everlasting. Amen.

**2 Cor. xiii. 14.**\

THE grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the
fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. Amen.
