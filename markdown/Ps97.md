| **Psalm 97. Dominus regnavit.**\                                      |
| THE LORD is King, the earth may be glad thereof; \* yea, the          |
| multitude of the isles may be glad thereof.\                          |
| 2 Clouds and darkness are round about him: \* righteousness and       |
| judgment are the habitation of his seat.\                             |
| 3 There shall go a fire before him, \* and burn up his enemies on     |
| every side.\                                                          |
| 4 His lightnings gave shine unto the world: \* the earth saw it, and  |
| was afraid.\                                                          |
| 5 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD; \* at the    |
| presence of the Lord of the whole earth.\                             |
| 6 The heavens have declared his righteousness, \* and all the peoples |
| have seen his glory.\                                                 |
| 7 Confounded be all they that worship carved images, and that delight |
| in vain gods: \* worship him, all ye gods.\                           |
| 8 Sion heard of it, and rejoiced; and the daughters of Judah were     |
| glad, \* because of thy judgments, O LORD.\                           |
| 9 For thou, LORD, art higher than all that are in the earth: \* thou  |
| art exalted far above all gods.\                                      |
| 10 O ye that love the LORD, see that ye hate the thing which is evil: |
| \* the Lord preserveth the souls of his saints; he shall deliver them |
| from the hand of the ungodly.\                                        |
| 11 There is sprung up a light for the righteous, \* and joyful        |
| gladness for such as are true-hearted.\                               |
| 12 Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; \* and give thanks for a        |
| remembrance of his holiness.                                          |
