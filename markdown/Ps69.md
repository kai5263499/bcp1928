| **Psalm 69. Salvum me fac.**\                                         |
| SAVE me, O God; \* for the waters are come in, even unto my soul.\    |
| 2 I stick fast in the deep mire, where no ground is; \* I am come     |
| into deep waters, so that the floods run over me.\                    |
| 3 I am weary of crying; my throat is dry; \* my sight faileth me for  |
| waiting so long upon my God.\                                         |
| 4 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my     |
| head; \* they that are mine enemies, and would destroy me guiltless,  |
| are mighty.\                                                          |
| 5 I paid them the things that I never took: \* God, thou knowest my   |
| simpleness, and my faults are not hid from thee.\                     |
| 6 Let not them that trust in thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed    |
| for my cause; \* let not those that seek thee be confounded through   |
| me, O Lord God of Israel.\                                            |
| 7 And why? for thy sake have I suffered reproof; \* shame hath        |
| covered my face.\                                                     |
| 8 I am become a stranger unto my brethren, \* even an alien unto my   |
| mother\'s children.\                                                  |
| 9 For the zeal of thine house hath even eaten me; \* and the rebukes  |
| of them that rebuked thee are fallen upon me.\                        |
| 10 I wept, and chastened myself with fasting, \* and that was turned  |
| to my reproof.\                                                       |
| 11 I put on sackcloth also, \* and they jested upon me.\              |
| 12 They that sit in the gate speak against me, \* and the drunkards   |
| make songs upon me.\                                                  |
| 13 But, LORD, I make my prayer unto thee \* in an acceptable time.\   |
| 14 Hear me, O God, in the multitude of thy mercy, \* even in the      |
| truth of thy salvation.\                                              |
| 15 Take me out of the mire, that I sink not; \* O let me be delivered |
| from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.\                  |
| 16 Let not the water-flood drown me, neither let the deep swallow me  |
| up; \* and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.\                   |
| 17 Hear me, O LORD, for thy loving-kindness is comfortable; \* turn   |
| thee unto me according to the multitude of thy mercies.\              |
| 18 And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: \* O  |
| haste thee, and hear me.\                                             |
| 19 Draw nigh unto my soul, and save it; \* O deliver me, because of   |
| mine enemies.\                                                        |
| 20 Thou hast known my reproach, my shame, and my dishonour: \* mine   |
| adversaries are all in thy sight.\                                    |
| 21 Reproach hath broken my heart; I am full of heaviness: \* I looked |
| for some to have pity on me, but there was no man, neither found I    |
| any to comfort me.\                                                   |
| 22 They gave me gall to eat; \* and when I was thirsty they gave me   |
| vinegar to drink.\                                                    |
| 23 Let their table be made a snare to take themselves withal; \* and  |
| let the things that should have been for their wealth be unto them an |
| occasion of falling.\                                                 |
| 24 Let their eyes be blinded, that they see not; \* and ever bow thou |
| down their backs.\                                                    |
| 25 Pour out thine indignation upon them, \* and let thy wrathful      |
| displeasure take hold of them.\                                       |
| 26 Let their habitation be void, \* and no man to dwell in their      |
| tents.\                                                               |
| 27 For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; \* and they talk    |
| how they may vex them whom thou hast wounded.\                        |
| 28 Let them fall from one wickedness to another, \* and not come into |
| thy righteousness.\                                                   |
| 29 Let them be wiped out of the book of the living, \* and not be     |
| written among the righteous.\                                         |
| 30 As for me, when I am poor and in heaviness, \* thy help, O God,    |
| shall lift me up.\                                                    |
| 31 I will praise the Name of God with a song, \* and magnify it with  |
| thanksgiving.\                                                        |
| 32 This also shall please the LORD \* better than a bullock that hath |
| horns and hoofs.\                                                     |
| 33 The humble shall consider this, and be glad: \* seek ye after God, |
| and your soul shall live.\                                            |
| 34 For the LORD heareth the poor, \* and despiseth not his            |
| prisoners.\                                                           |
| 35 Let heaven and earth praise him: \* the sea, and all that moveth   |
| therein.\                                                             |
| 36 For God will save Sion, and build the cities of Judah, \* that men |
| may dwell there, and have it in possession.\                          |
| 37 The posterity also of his servants shall inherit it; \* and they   |
| that love his Name shall dwell therein.                               |
