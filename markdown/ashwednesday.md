The Collect.

![cdeer](http://stats.superstats.com/b/ss/DAVIDMCMANNES/1){border="0"}

[]{#anchor1121543}ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, who hatest nothing that
thou hast made, and dost forgive the sins of all those who are penitent;
Create and make in us new and contrite hearts, that we, worthily
lamenting our sins and acknowledging our wretchedness, may obtain of
thee, the God of all mercy, perfect remission and forgiveness; through
Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

###### *¶ This Collect is to be said every day in Lent, after the Collect appointed for the day, until Palm Sunday.*

For the Epistle. Joel ii. 12.

TURN ye even to me, saith the LORD, with all your heart, and with
fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning: and rend your heart, and
not your garments, and turn unto the LORD your God: for he is gracious
and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth him of
the evil. Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing
behind him; even a meat-offering and a drink-offering unto the LORD your
God? Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly:
gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders,
gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom
go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet. Let the
priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and the
altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O LORD, and give not thine
heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them: wherefore
should they say among the people, Where is their God?\

The Gospel. St. Matthew vi. 16.

WHEN ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they
disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I
say unto you, They have their reward. But thou, when thou fastest,
anoint thine head, and wash thy face; that thou appear not unto men to
fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which
seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly. Lay not up for yourselves
treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where
thieves break through and steal: but lay up for yourselves treasures in
heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do
not break through nor steal: for where your treasure is, there will your
heart be also.

###### * ¶ The same Collect, Epistle, and Gospel shall serve for every day after, unto the next Sunday, except upon the Feast of St. Matthias.*
