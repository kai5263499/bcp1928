| surely keep his sins \[in remembrance.\]\                             |
| 2 Forgive thy neighbour the hurt that he hath done unto thee, so      |
| shall thy sins also be forgiven when thou prayest.\                   |
| 3 One man beareth hatred against another, and doth he seek pardon     |

| 7 Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that   |
| offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!\       |
| []{#anchor394560}8 Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut |
| them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter     |
| into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to |
| be cast into everlasting fire.\                                       |
| 9 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee:  |
| it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than    |
| having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.\                           |
| 10 Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say  |
| unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my |
| Father which is in heaven.\                                           |
| 11 For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.\           |
| 12 How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be   |
| gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into    |
| the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?\                |
| 13 And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth  |
| more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not        |
| astray.\                                                              |
| 14 Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that |
| one of these little ones should perish.\                              |
| 15 Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell   |
| him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou |
| hast gained thy brother.\                                             |
| 16 But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, |
| that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be         |
| established.\                                                         |
| 17 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but |
| if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen  |
| man and a publican.\                                                  |
| 18 Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be  |
| bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be      |
| loosed in heaven.\                                                    |
| 19 Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as   |
| touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of  |
| my Father which is in heaven.\                                        |
| 20 For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am  |
| I in the midst of them.\                                              |

| Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.\         |
| 7 For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the   |

| from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other    |
| gods,\                                                                |

| shall not do this thing.\                                             |
| 13 Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all   |
| the prophets, and by all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil    |
| ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the  |
| law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my     |

| their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them;   |
| and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the heathen |
| that were round about them, concerning whom the LORD had charged      |
| them, that they should not do like them.\                             |
| 16 And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made |
| them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove, and worshipped |
| all the host of heaven, and served Baal.\                             |

| wipeth a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down.\                |

| have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:\                  |
| 14 But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should   |
| not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.\                       |
| 15 For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou          |
| shouldest receive him for ever;\                                      |
| 16 Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved,      |
| specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and  |
| in the Lord?\                                                         |

| 18 If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee aught, put that on mine     |
| account;\                                                             |

| I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self       |
| besides.\                                                             |

| bowels in the Lord.\                                                  |

| and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he    |
| read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which    |
| was found in the house of the LORD.\                                  |

| testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul, |
| to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. |

| the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of  |
| the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and   |
| for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them     |
| without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of   |
| them unto Beth-el.\                                                   |

| the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber  |
| of Nathan-melech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and       |

| and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the   |
| abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.\           |

| filled their places with the bones of men.\                           |

| 37 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we     |
| thee an hungered, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?\     |
| 38 When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and       |
| clothed thee?\                                                        |
| 39 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?\       |
| 40 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto     |
| you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my    |
| brethren, ye have done it unto me.\                                   |
| 41 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, |
| ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his      |
| angels:\                                                              |
| 42 For I was an hungered, and ye gave me no meat; I was thirsty, and  |
| ye gave me no drink:\                                                 |
| 43 I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me  |
| not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.\                     |
| 44 Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an |
| hungered, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, |
| and did not minister unto thee?\                                      |
| 45 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch |
| as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.\  |
| 46 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the       |
| righteous into life eternal.\                                         |
