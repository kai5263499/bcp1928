| **Psalm 100. Jubilate Deo.**\                                         |
| O BE joyful in the LORD, all ye lands: \* serve the LORD with         |
| gladness, and come before his presence with a song.\                  |
| 2 Be ye sure that the LORD he is God; it is he that hath made us, and |
| not we ourselves; \* we are his people, and the sheep of his          |
| pasture.\                                                             |
| 3 O go your way into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts |
| with praise; \* be thankful unto him, and speak good of his Name.\    |
| 4 For the LORD is gracious, his mercy is everlasting; \* and his      |
| truth endureth from generation to generation.                         |
