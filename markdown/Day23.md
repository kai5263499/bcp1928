| **Psalm 110. Dixit Dominus.**\                                        |
| THE LORD said unto my Lord, \* Sit thou on my right hand, until I     |
| make thine enemies thy footstool.\                                    |
| 2 The LORD shall send the rod of thy power out of Sion: \* be thou    |
| ruler, even in the midst among thine enemies.\                        |
| 3 In the day of thy power shall thy people offer themselves willingly |
| with an holy worship: \* thy young men come to thee as dew from the   |
| womb of the morning.\                                                 |
| 4 The LORD sware, and will not repent, \* Thou art a Priest for ever  |
| after the order of Melchizedek.\                                      |
| 5 The Lord upon thy right hand \* shall wound even kings in the day   |
| of his wrath.\                                                        |
| 6 He shall judge among the heathen; \* he shall fill the places with  |
| the dead bodies, and smite in sunder the heads over divers            |
| countries.\                                                           |

| up his head.\                                                         |

| Psalm 111. Confitebor tibi.**\                                        |
| I WILL give thanks unto the LORD with my whole heart, \* secretly     |
| among the faithful, and in the congregation.\                         |
| 2 The works of the LORD are great, \* sought out of all them that     |
| have pleasure therein.\                                               |
| 3 His work is worthy to be praised and had in honour, \* and his      |
| righteousness endureth for ever.\                                     |
| 4 The merciful and gracious LORD hath so done his marvellous works,   |
| \* that they ought to be had in remembrance.\                         |
| 5 He hath given meat unto them that fear him; \* he shall ever be     |
| mindful of his covenant.\                                             |
| 6 He hath showed his people the power of his works, \* that he may    |
| give them the heritage of the heathen.\                               |
| 7 The works of his hands are verity and judgment; \* all his          |
| commandments are true.\                                               |

| equity.\                                                              |
| 9 He sent redemption unto his people; \* he hath commanded his        |
| covenant for ever; holy and reverend is his Name.\                    |
| 10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; \* a good         |
| understanding have all they that do thereafter; his praise endureth   |
| for ever.\                                                            |

| Psalm 112. Beatus vir.**\                                             |
| BLESSED is the man that feareth the LORD; \* he hath great delight in |
| his commandments.\                                                    |
| 2 His seed shall be mighty upon earth; \* the generation of the       |
| faithful shall be blessed.\                                           |
| 3 Riches and plenteousness shall be in his house; \* and his          |
| righteousness endureth for ever.\                                     |
| 4 Unto the godly there ariseth up light in the darkness; \* he is     |
| merciful, loving, and righteous.\                                     |
| 5 A good man is merciful, and lendeth; \* and will guide his words    |
| with discretion.\                                                     |
| 6 For he shall never be moved: \* and the righteous shall be had in   |
| everlasting remembrance.\                                             |
| 7 He will not be afraid of any evil tidings; \* for his heart         |
| standeth fast, and believeth in the LORD.\                            |
| 8 His heart is stablished, and will not shrink, \* until he see his   |
| desire upon his enemies.\                                             |
| 9 He hath dispersed abroad, and given to the poor. \* and his         |
| righteousness remaineth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with      |
| honour.\                                                              |
| 10 The ungodly shall see it, and it shall grieve him; \* he shall     |
| gnash with his teeth, and consume away; the desire of the ungodly     |
| shall perish.\                                                        |

| Psalm 113. Laudate, pueri.**\                                         |

| 4 The LORD is high above all nations, \* and his glory above the      |

| **Psalm 114. In exitu Israel.**\                                      |
| WHEN Israel came out of Egypt, \* and the house of Jacob from among   |
| the strange people,\                                                  |
| 2 Judah was his sanctuary, \* and Israel his dominion.\               |
| 3 The sea saw that, and fled; \* Jordan was driven back.\             |
| 4 The mountains skipped like rams, \* and the little hills like young |
| sheep.\                                                               |
| 5 What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? \* and thou       |
| Jordan, that thou wast driven back?\                                  |
| 6 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams? \* and ye little hills,    |
| like young sheep?\                                                    |
| 7 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord: \* at the         |
| presence of the God of Jacob;\                                        |
| 8 Who turned the hard rock into a standing water, \': and the         |
| flint-stone into a springing well.\                                   |
| \                                                                     |

| Psalm 115. Non nobis, Domine.**\                                      |
| NOT unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy Name give the praise;  |
| \* for thy loving mercy, and for thy truth\'s sake.\                  |
| 2 Wherefore shall the heathen say, \* Where is now their God?\        |
| 3 As for our God, he is in heaven: \* he hath done whatsoever pleased |
| him.\                                                                 |
| 4 Their idols are silver and gold, \* even the work of men\'s hands.\ |
| 5 They have mouths, and speak not; \* eyes have they, and see not.\   |
| 6 They have ears, and hear not; \* noses have they, and smell not.\   |
| 7 They have hands, and handle not; feet have they, and walk not; \*   |
| neither speak they through their throat.\                             |
| 8 They that make them are like unto them; \* and so are all such as   |
| put their trust in them.\                                             |
| 9 But thou, house of Israel, trust thou in the LORD; \* he is their   |
| helper and defender.\                                                 |
| 10 Ye house of Aaron, put your trust in the LORD; \* he is their      |
| helper and defender.\                                                 |
| 11 Ye that fear the LORD, put your trust in the LORD; \* he is their  |
| helper and defender.\                                                 |
| 12 The LORD hath been mindful of us, and he shall bless us; \* even   |
| he shall bless the house of Israel, he shall bless the house of       |
| Aaron.\                                                               |
| 13 He shall bless them that fear the LORD, \* both small and great.\  |
| 14 The LORD shall increase you more and more, \* you and your         |
| children.\                                                            |
| 15 Ye are the blessed of the LORD, \* who made heaven and earth.\     |
| 16 All the whole heavens are the LORD\'S; \* the earth hath he given  |
| to the children of men.\                                              |
| 17 The dead praise not thee, O LORD, \* neither all they that go down |
| into silence.\                                                        |
| 18 But we will praise the LORD, \* from this time forth for evermore. |
| Praise the LORD.\                                                     |
