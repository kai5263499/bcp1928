| **Psalm 118. Confitemini Domino.**\                                   |
| O GIVE thanks unto the LORD, for he is gracious; \* because his mercy |
| endureth for ever.\                                                   |
| 2 Let Israel now confess that he is gracious, \* and that his mercy   |
| endureth for ever.\                                                   |
| 3 Let the house of Aaron now confess, \* that his mercy endureth for  |
| ever.\                                                                |
| 4 Yea, let them now that fear the LORD confess, \* that his mercy     |
| endureth for ever.\                                                   |
| 5 I called upon the LORD in trouble; \* and the LORD heard me at      |
| large.\                                                               |
| 6 The LORD is on my side; \* I will not fear what man doeth unto me.\ |
| 7 The LORD taketh my part with them that help me; \* therefore shall  |
| I see my desire upon mine enemies.\                                   |
| 8 It is better to trust in the LORD, \* than to put any confidence in |
| man.\                                                                 |
| 9 It is better to trust in the LORD, \* than to put any confidence in |
| princes.\                                                             |
| 10 All nations compassed me round about; \* but in the Name of the    |
| LORD will I destroy them.\                                            |
| 11 They kept me in on every side, they kept me in, I say, on every    |
| side; \* but in the Name of the LORD will I destroy them.\            |
| 12 They came about me like bees, and are extinct even as the fire     |
| among the thorns; \* for in the Name of the LORD I will destroy       |
| them.\                                                                |
| 13 Thou hast thrust sore at me, that I might fall; \* but the LORD    |
| was my help.\                                                         |
| 14 The LORD is my strength, and my song; \* and is become my          |
| salvation.\                                                           |
| 15 The voice of joy and health is in the dwellings of the righteous;  |
| \* the right hand of the LORD bringeth mighty things to pass.\        |
| 16 The right hand of the LORD hath the pre-eminence; \* the right     |
| hand of the LORD bringeth mighty things to pass.\                     |
| 17 I shall not die, but live, \* and declare the works of the LORD.\  |
| 18 The LORD hath chastened and corrected me; \* but he hath not given |
| me over unto death.\                                                  |
| 19 Open me the gates of righteousness, \* that I may go into them,    |
| and give thanks unto the LORD.\                                       |
| 20 This is the gate of the LORD, \* the righteous shall enter into    |
| it.\                                                                  |
| 21 I will thank thee; for thou hast heard me, \* and art become my    |
| salvation.\                                                           |
| 22 The same stone which the builders refused, \* is become the        |
| head-stone in the comer.\                                             |
| 23 This is the LORD\'S doing, \* and it is marvellous in our eyes.\   |
| 24 This is the day which the LORD hath made; \* we will rejoice and   |
| be glad in it.\                                                       |
| 25 Help me now, O LORD: \* O LORD, send us now prosperity.\           |
| 26 Blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the LORD: \* we have      |
| wished you good luck, we that are of the house of the LORD.\          |
| 27 God is the LORD, who hath showed us light: \* bind the sacrifice   |
| with cords, yea, even unto the horns of the altar.\                   |
| 28 Thou art my God, and I will thank thee; \* thou art my God, and I  |
| will praise thee.\                                                    |
| 29 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is gracious, \* and his mercy  |
| endureth for ever.                                                    |
