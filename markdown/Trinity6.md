| hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.\       |
| 17 And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the   |

| servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.\        |
| 18 And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king\'s         |
| household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera |
| fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;\               |
| 19 And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me,   |

| take it to his heart.\                                                |

| meet my lord the king.\                                               |

| nigh; neither shall the people go up with him.\                       |
| 3 And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and   |
| all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and    |
| said, All the words which the LORD hath said will we do.\             |
| 4 And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in the |

| according to the twelve tribes of Israel.\                            |
| 5 And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered      |

| the blood he sprinkled on the altar.\                                 |
| 7 And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of   |

| []{#anchor355970}19 For when Moses had spoken every precept to all    |
| the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of   |
| goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both   |
| the book, and all the people,\                                        |
| 20 Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined |
| unto you.\                                                            |
| 21 Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the  |
| vessels of the ministry.\                                             |
| 22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and        |
| without shedding of blood is no remission.\                           |
| 23 It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the      |
| heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things        |
| themselves with better sacrifices than these.\                        |
| 24 For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands,    |
| which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to     |
| appear in the presence of God for us:\                                |
| 25 Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest     |
| entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;\        |
| 26 For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the   |
| world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put   |
| away sin by the sacrifice of himself.\                                |
| 27 And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the    |
| judgment:\                                                            |
| 28 So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them |
| that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto    |
| salvation.\                                                           |

| launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the day       |
| following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:\                  |

| sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to      |
| unlade her burden.\                                                   |

| Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.\      |
| 5 And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our   |
| way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children,     |
| till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and   |
| prayed.\                                                              |

| unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the            |
| evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him.\          |
| 9 And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.\  |
| 10 And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a   |
| certain prophet, named Agabus.\                                       |
| 11 And when he was come unto us, he took Paul\'s girdle, and bound    |
| his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall |
| the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall |
| deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.\                          |
| 12 And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place,   |
| besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.\                              |
| []{#anchor414492}13 Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to   |

| at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.\    |

| when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines:   |
| and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.\      |
| 3 And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel   |

| with the ark of the covenant of God.\                                 |

| What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the         |
| Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD was come into   |

| cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds   |
| of music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: |

| 16 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the king, O |
| Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter.\    |
| 17 If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the  |
| burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O    |

| speak unto the people.\                                               |
| 40 And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and   |
| beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a     |
| great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,\      |

| they kept the more silence: and he saith,)\                           |
| 3 I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in         |

| taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and |

| into prisons both men and women.\                                     |
| 5 As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of |

| Jerusalem, for to be punished.\                                       |

| Saul, why persecutest thou me?\                                       |
| 8 And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus |

| Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all   |
| things which are appointed for thee to do.\                           |
| 11 And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by |
| the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.\            |
| 12 And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good  |
| report of all the Jews which dwelt there,\                            |
| 13 Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive   |
| thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.\                   |

| wherefore they cried so against him.\                                 |
| 25 And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion    |
| that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, |
| and uncondemned?\                                                     |
| 26 When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, |
| saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.\          |
| 27 Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou  |
| a Roman? He said, Yea.\                                               |
| 28 And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this   |
| freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.\                         |
| 29 Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined |
| him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was |
| a Roman, and because he had bound him.\                               |
