| **Psalm 149. Cantate Domino.**\                                       |
| O SING unto the LORD a new song; \* let the congregation of saints    |
| praise him.\                                                          |
| 2 Let Israel rejoice in him that made him, \* and let the children of |
| Sion be joyful in their King.\                                        |
| 3 Let them praise his Name in the dance: \* let them sing praises     |
| unto him with tabret and harp.\                                       |
| 4 For the LORD hath pleasure in his people, \* and helpeth the        |
| meek-hearted.\                                                        |
| 5 Let the saints be joyful with glory; \* let them rejoice in their   |
| beds.\                                                                |
| 6 Let the praises of God be in their mouth; \* and a two-edged sword  |
| in their hands;\                                                      |
| 7 To be avenged of the nations, \* and to rebuke the peoples;\        |
| 8 To bind their kings in chains, \* and their nobles with links of    |
| iron;\                                                                |
| 9 To execute judgment upon them; as it is written, \* Such honour     |
| have all his saints.                                                  |
