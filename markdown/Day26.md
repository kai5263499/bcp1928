| XIV\. Lucerna pedibus meis.\                                          |
| THY word is a lantern unto my feet, \* and a light unto my paths.\    |
| 106 I have sworn, and am stedfastly purposed, \* to keep thy          |
| righteous judgments.\                                                 |
| 107 I am troubled above measure: \* quicken me, O LORD, according to  |
| thy word.\                                                            |
| 108 Let the free-will offerings of my mouth please thee, O LORD; \*   |
| and teach me thy judgments.\                                          |
| 109 My soul is alway in my hand; \* yet do I not forget thy law.\     |
| 110 The ungodly have laid a snare for me; \* but yet I swerved not    |
| from thy commandments.\                                               |
| 111 Thy testimonies have I claimed as mine heritage for ever; \* and  |
| why? they are the very joy of my heart.\                              |
| 112 I have applied my heart to fulfil thy statutes alway, \* even     |
| unto the end.\                                                        |
| \                                                                     |
| \                                                                     |
| XV. Iniquos odio habui.\                                              |
| I HATE them that imagine evil things; \* but thy law do I love.\      |
| 114 Thou art my defence and shield; \* and my trust is in thy word.\  |
| 115 Away from me, ye wicked; \* I will keep the commandments of my    |
| God.\                                                                 |
| 116 O stablish me according to thy word, that I may live; \* and let  |
| me not be disappointed of my hope.\                                   |
| 117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe; \* yea, my delight shall be |
| ever in thy statutes.\                                                |
| 118 Thou hast trodden down all them that depart from thy statutes; \* |
| for they imagine but deceit.\                                         |
| 119 Thou puttest away all the ungodly of the earth like dross; \*     |
| therefore I love thy testimonies.\                                    |
| 120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; \* and I am afraid of thy    |
| judgments.\                                                           |
| \                                                                     |

| XVI. Feci judicium.\                                                  |
| I DEAL with the thing that is lawful and right; \* O give me not over |
| unto mine oppressors.\                                                |
| 122 Make thou thy servant to delight in that which is good, \* that   |
| the proud do me no wrong.\                                            |
| 123 Mine eyes are wasted away with looking for thy health, \* and for |
| the word of thy righteousness.\                                       |
| 124 O deal with thy servant according unto thy loving mercy, \* and   |
| teach me thy statutes.\                                               |
| 125 I am thy servant; O grant me understanding, \* that I may know    |
| thy testimonies.\                                                     |
| 126 It is time for thee, LORD, to lay to thine hand; \* for they have |
| destroyed thy law.\                                                   |
| 127 For I love thy commandments \* above gold and precious stones.\   |
| 128 Therefore hold I straight all thy commandments; \* and all false  |
| ways I utterly abhor.\                                                |
| \                                                                     |
| \                                                                     |
| XVII. Mirabilia.\                                                     |
| THY testimonies are wonderful; \* therefore doth my soul keep them.\  |
| 130 When thy word goeth forth, \* it giveth light and understanding   |
| unto the simple.\                                                     |
| 131 I opened my mouth, and drew in my breath; \* for my delight was   |
| in thy commandments.\                                                 |
| 132 O look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, \* as thou usest to |
| do unto those that love thy Name.\                                    |
| 133 Order my steps in thy word; \* and so shall no wickedness have    |
| dominion over me.\                                                    |
| 134 O deliver me from the wrongful dealings of men; \* and so shall I |
| keep thy commandments.\                                               |
| 135 Show the light of thy countenance upon thy servant, \* and teach  |
| me thy statutes.\                                                     |
| 136 Mine eyes gush out with water, \* because men keep not thy law.\  |
| \                                                                     |
| \                                                                     |
| XVIII. Justus es, Domine.\                                            |
| RIGHTEOUS art thou, O LORD; \* and true are thy judgments.\           |
| 138 The testimonies that thou hast commanded \* are exceeding         |
| righteous and true.\                                                  |
| 139 My zeal hath even consumed me; \* because mine enemies have       |
| forgotten thy words.\                                                 |
| 140 Thy word is tried to the uttermost, \* and thy servant loveth     |
| it.\                                                                  |
| 141 I am small and of no reputation; \* yet do I not forget thy       |
| commandments.\                                                        |
| 142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, \* and thy law |
| is the truth.\                                                        |
| 143 Trouble and heaviness have taken hold upon me; \* yet is my       |
| delight in thy commandments.\                                         |
| 144 The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: \* O grant   |
| me understanding, and I shall live.\                                  |

| XIX\. Clamavi in toto corde meo.\                                     |
| I CALL with my whole heart; \* hear me, O LORD; I will keep thy       |
| statutes.\                                                            |

| trust.\                                                               |
| 148 Mine eyes prevent the night watches; \* that I might be occupied  |
| in thy word.\                                                         |
| 149 Hear my voice, O LORD, according unto thy lovingkindness; \*      |
| quicken me, according to thy judgments.\                              |
| 150 They draw nigh that of malice persecute me, \* and are far from   |
| thy law.\                                                             |
| 151 Be thou nigh at hand, O LORD; \* for all thy commandments are     |
| true.\                                                                |
| 152 As concerning thy testimonies, I have known long since, \* that   |
| thou hast grounded them for ever.\                                    |
| \                                                                     |

| O CONSIDER mine adversity, and deliver me, \* for I do not forget thy |

| 155 Health is far from the ungodly; \* for they regard not thy        |
| statutes.\                                                            |
| 156 Great is thy mercy, O LORD; \* quicken me, as thou art wont.\     |
| 157 Many there are that trouble me, and persecute me; \* yet do I not |
| swerve from thy testimonies.\                                         |
| 158 It grieveth me when I see the transgressors; \* because they keep |
| not thy law.\                                                         |
| 159 Consider, O LORD, how I love thy commandments; \* O quicken me,   |
| according to thy loving-kindness.\                                    |
| 160 Thy word is true from everlasting; \* all the judgments of thy    |
| righteousness endure for evermore.\                                   |
| \                                                                     |

| 172 Yea, my tongue shall sing of thy word; \* for all thy             |
| commandments are righteous.\                                          |
| 173 Let thine hand help me; \* for I have chosen thy commandments.\   |
| 174 I have longed for thy saving health, O LORD; \* and in thy law is |
| my delight.\                                                          |

| judgments shall help me.\                                             |
