**Psalm 6. Domine, ne in furore.**\
O LORD, rebuke me not in thine indignation, \* neither chasten me in thy
displeasure.\
2 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am weak; \* O LORD, heal me, for my
bones are vexed.\
3 My soul also is sore troubled: \* but, LORD, how long wilt thou punish
me?\
4 Turn thee, O LORD, and deliver my soul; \* O save me, for thy mercy\'s
sake.\
5 For in death no man remembereth thee; \* and who will give thee thanks
in the pit?\
6 I am weary of my groaning; \* every night wash I my bed, and water my
couch with my tears.\
7 My beauty is gone for very trouble, \* and worn away because of all
mine enemies.\
8 Away from me, all ye that work iniquity; \* for the LORD hath heard
the voice of my weeping.\
9 The LORD hath heard my petition; \* the LORD will receive my prayer.\
10 All mine enemies shall be confounded, and sore vexed; \* they shall
be turned back, and put to shame suddenly.\

**Psalm 7. Domine, Deus meus.**\
O LORD my God, in thee have I put my trust: \* save me from all them
that persecute me, and deliver me;\
2 Lest he devour my soul like a lion, and tear it in pieces, \* while
there is none to help.\
3 O LORD my God, if I have done any such thing; \* or if there be any
wickedness in my hands;\
4 If I have rewarded evil unto him that dealt friendly with me; \* (yea,
I have delivered him that without any cause is mine enemy;)\
5 Then let mine enemy persecute my soul, and take me; \* yea, let him
tread my life down upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust.\
6 Stand up, O LORD, in thy wrath, and lift up thyself, because of the
indignation of mine enemies; \* arise up for me in the judgment that
thou hast commanded.\
7 And so shall the congregation of the peoples come about thee: \* for
their sakes therefore lift up thyself again.\
8 The LORD shall judge the peoples: give sentence with me, O LORD, \*
according to my righteousness, and according to the innocency that is in
me.\
9 O let the wickedness of the ungodly come to an end; \* but guide thou
the just.\
10 For the righteous God \* trieth the very hearts and reins.\
11 My help cometh of God, \* who preserveth them that are true of
heart.\
12 God is a righteous Judge, strong, and patient; \* and God is provoked
every day.\
13 If a man will not turn, he will whet his sword; \* he hath bent his
bow, and made it ready.\
14 He hath prepared for him the instruments of death; \* he ordaineth
his arrows against the persecutors.\
15 Behold, the ungodly travaileth with iniquity; \* he hath conceived
mischief, and brought forth falsehood.\
16 He hath graven and digged up a pit, \* and is fallen himself into the
destruction that he made for other.\
17 For his travail shall come upon his own head, \* and his wickedness
shall fall on his own pate.\
18 I will give thanks unto the LORD, according to his righteousness; \*
and I will praise the Name of the LORD Most High.\

**Psalm 8. Domine, Dominus noster.**\
O LORD our Governor, how excellent is thy Name in all the world; \* thou
that hast set thy glory above the heavens!\
2 Out of the mouth of very babes and sucklings hast thou ordained
strength, because of thine enemies, \* that thou mightest still the
enemy and the avenger.\
3 When I consider thy heavens, even the work of thy fingers; \* the moon
and the stars which thou hast ordained;\
4 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? \* and the son of man, that
thou visitest him?\
5 Thou madest him lower than the angels, \* to crown him with glory and
worship.\
6 Thou makest him to have dominion of the works of thy hands; \* and
thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet:\
7 All sheep and oxen; \* yea, and the beasts of the field;\
8 The fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea; \* and whatsoever
walketh through the paths of the seas.\
9 O LORD our Governor, \* how excellent is thy Name in all the world!
