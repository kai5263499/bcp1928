| O GOD, whom year by year we praise for the dedication of this church; |
| Hear, we beseech thee, the prayers of thy people, and grant that      |
| whosoever shall worship before thee in this place, may obtain thy     |
| merciful aid and protection; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\    |

| LAYING aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies,  |
| and all evil speakings, as newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of  |
| the word, that ye may grow thereby: if so be ye have tasted that the  |
| Lord is gracious. To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed  |
| indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious, ye also, as lively    |
| stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer  |
| up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.\          |

| JESUS went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold    |
| and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the             |
| money-changers, and the seats of them that sold doves, and said unto  |
| them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer;    |
| but ye have made it a den of thieves. And the blind and the lame came |
| to him in the temple; and he healed them. And when the chief priests  |
| and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children    |
| crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they   |
| were sore displeased, and said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? |
| And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth  |
| of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?                    |
|                                                                       |
