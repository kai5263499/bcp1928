| **Psalms 36. Dixit injustus.**\                                       |
| MY heart showeth me the wickedness of the ungodly, \* that there is   |
| no fear of God before his eyes.\                                      |
| 2 For he flattereth himself in his own sight, \* until his abominable |
| sin be found out.\                                                    |
| 3 The words of his mouth are unrighteous and full of deceit: \* he    |
| hath left off to behave himself wisely, and to do good.\              |
| 4 He imagineth mischief upon his bed, and hath set himself in no good |
| way; \* neither doth he abhor any thing that is evil.\                |
| []{#anchor1874161}5 Thy mercy, O LORD, reacheth unto the heavens, \*  |
| and thy faithfulness unto the clouds.\                                |
| 6 Thy righteousness standeth like the strong mountains: \* thy        |
| judgments are like the great deep.\                                   |
| 7 Thou, LORD, shalt save both man and beast: how excellent is thy     |
| mercy, O God! \* and the children of men shall put their trust under  |
| the shadow of thy wings.\                                             |
| 8 They shall be satisfied with the plenteousness of thy house; \* and |
| thou shalt give them drink of thy pleasures, as out of the river.\    |
| 9 For with thee is the well of life; \* and in thy light shall we see |
| light.\                                                               |
| 10 O continue forth thy loving-kindness unto them that know thee, \*  |
| and thy righteousness unto them that are true of heart.\              |
| 11 O let not the foot of pride come against me; \* and let not the    |
| hand of the ungodly cast me down.\                                    |
| 12 There are they fallen, all that work wickedness; \* they are cast  |
| down, and shall not be able to stand.                                 |
