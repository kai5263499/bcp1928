| 4 Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be |
| made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough       |

| grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field:\ |
| 7 The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the   |
| LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people is grass.\                    |

| 1 After these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at   |
| the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise showed he himself.\             |
| 2 There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and     |
| Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other  |
| of his disciples.\                                                    |
| 3 Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a-fishing. They say unto him, We  |
| also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship           |
| immediately; and that night they caught nothing.\                     |
| 4 But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but    |
| the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.\                            |
| 5 Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They        |
| answered him, No.\                                                    |
| 6 And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship,  |
| and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to |
| draw it for the multitude of fishes.\                                 |
| 7 Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is    |
| the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt    |
| his fisher\'s coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself |
| into the sea.\                                                        |
| 8 And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not   |
| far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net   |
| with fishes.\                                                         |
| 9 As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals    |
| there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.\                             |
| 10 Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now         |
| caught.\                                                              |
| 11 Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great        |
| fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so     |
| many, yet was not the net broken.\                                    |
| 12 Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples    |
| durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.\           |
| 13 Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish     |
| likewise.\                                                            |
| 14 This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to his        |
| disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.\                    |
| 15 So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of  |
| Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord;  |
| thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.\     |
| 16 He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest |
| thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. |
| He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.\                                    |
| 17 He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou |
| me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest |
| thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou    |
| knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.\       |
| 18 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou        |
| girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou   |
| shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall   |
| gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.\                 |

| 12 But Moses\' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it    |
| under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, |
| the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his     |
| hands were steady until the going down of the sun.\                   |

| 17 And Moses\' father-in-law said unto him, The thing that thou doest |
| is not good.\                                                         |
| 18 Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is     |
| with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to |
| perform it thyself alone.\                                            |
| 19 Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall |
| be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest    |
| bring the causes unto God:\                                           |
| 20 And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt show them |
| the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.\      |
| 21 Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such   |
| as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over   |
| them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of    |
| fifties, and rulers of tens:\                                         |
| 22 And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be,     |
| that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small   |
| matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they  |
| shall bear the burden with thee.\                                     |
| []{#anchor3442279}23 If thou shalt do this thing, and God command     |
| thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall |
| also go to their place in peace.\                                     |
| 24 So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all  |
| that he had said.\                                                    |

| fifties, and rulers of tens.\                                         |
| 26 And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they    |
| brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.\   |

| 1 For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God,   |
| who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and        |
| blessed him;\                                                         |

| Salem, which is, King of peace;\                                      |

| God; abideth a priest continually.\                                   |

| Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.\                                |
| 5 And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the       |
| office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the    |
| people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they  |
| come out of the loins of Abraham:\                                    |
| 6 But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of    |
| Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.\                      |
| 7 And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.\   |
| 8 And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them,  |
| of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.\                              |
| 9 And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, paid tithes   |
| in Abraham.\                                                          |

| him.\                                                                 |
| []{#anchor3439582}11 If therefore perfection were by the Levitical    |

| the children of Israel;\                                              |

| before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.\     |
| 16 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there    |
| were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and   |
| the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that  |
| was in the camp trembled.\                                            |

| descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the      |
| smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.\              |
| 19 And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder   |
| and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.\            |

| 12 For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a     |
| change also of the law.\                                              |
| 13 For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another       |
| tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.\                 |
| 14 For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah; of which      |
| tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.\                     |
| 15 And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of   |
| Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,\                            |
| 16 Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after  |
| the power of an endless life.\                                        |
| 17 For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of   |
| Melchisedec.\                                                         |
| 18 For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before |
| for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.\                       |
| 19 For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better  |
| hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.\                        |

| 21 (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an     |
| oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent,   |
| Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)\          |
| 22 By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.\         |
| 23 And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered   |
| to continue by reason of death:\                                      |
| 24 But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable     |
| priesthood.\                                                          |
| 25 Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come  |
| unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for       |
| them.\                                                                |

| evildoer, or as a busybody in other men\'s matters.\                  |

| let him glorify God on this behalf.\                                  |
| 17 For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: |

| Egypt, out of the house of bondage.\                                  |

| shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy       |

| that is within thy gates:\                                            |

| 1 Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have     |
| such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of    |
| the Majesty in the heavens;\                                          |
| 2 A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the  |
| Lord pitched, and not man.\                                           |
| 3 For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices:    |
| wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to      |
| offer.\                                                               |
| 4 For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that     |
| there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:\             |
| 5 Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses  |
| was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for,  |
| See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern     |
| shown to thee in the mount.\                                          |
| 6 But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much     |
| also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established   |
| upon better promises.\                                                |

| have been sought for the second.\                                     |
| 8 For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith |
| the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel    |
| and with the house of Judah:\                                         |
| 9 Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the |
| day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of      |
| Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them |
| not, saith the Lord.\                                                 |
| []{#anchor3411410}10 For this is the covenant that I will make with   |
| the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my   |
| laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be   |
| to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:\                     |
| 11 And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man    |
| his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the   |
| least to the greatest.\                                               |

| 1 And He said unto Moses, Come up unto the LORD, thou, and Aaron,     |
| Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye |
| afar off.\                                                            |
| 2 And Moses alone shall come near the LORD: but they shall not come   |
| nigh; neither shall the people go up with him.\                       |
| []{#anchor3403034}3 And Moses came and told the people all the words  |
| of the LORD, and all the judgments: and all the people answered with  |
| one voice, and said, All the words which the LORD hath said will we   |
| do.\                                                                  |
| 4 And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in the |
| morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars,     |
| according to the twelve tribes of Israel.\                            |
| 5 And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered      |
| burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the      |
| LORD.\                                                                |
| 6 And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basins; and half of |
| the blood he sprinkled on the altar.\                                 |
| []{#anchor3405136}7 And he took the book of the covenant, and read in |
| the audience of the people: and they said, All that the LORD hath     |
| said will we do, and be obedient.\                                    |
| 8 And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, |
| Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with you   |
| concerning all these words.\                                          |
| 9 Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the |
| elders of Israel:\                                                    |
| 10 And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it |
| were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of     |
| heaven in his clearness.\                                             |
| 11 And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his      |
| hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink.\                      |
| 16 And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud    |
| covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of  |
| the midst of the cloud.\                                              |
| 17 And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire on  |
| the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.\          |
| 18 And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up into    |
| the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.\   |

| Hebrews 9:1-14**\                                                     |
| 1 Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine        |
| service, and a worldly sanctuary.\                                    |
| 2 For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the         |
| candlestick, and the table, and the showbread; which is called the    |
| sanctuary.\                                                           |
| 3 And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the       |
| Holiest of all;\                                                      |
| 4 Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid   |
| round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and |
| Aaron\'s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;\            |
| 5 And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of      |
| which we cannot now speak particularly.\                              |
| 6 Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always   |
| into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.\         |
| 7 But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not |
| without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of    |
| the people:\                                                          |
| 8 The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of    |
| all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet  |
| standing:\                                                            |
| 9 Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered |
| both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the       |
| service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;\                    |
| []{#anchor3401167}10 Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers |
| washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of    |
| reformation.\                                                         |
| 11 But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a  |
| greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to  |
| say, not of this building;\                                           |
| 12 Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he  |
| entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal          |
| redemption for us.\                                                   |
| 13 For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer |
| sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:\   |
| []{#anchor3398789}14 How much more shall the blood of Christ, who     |
| through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge |
| your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?\             |

| to the woman, What hast thou brought forth?\                          |

| of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my   |
| hands command ye me.\                                                 |
| 12 I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my hands,  |
| have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.\ |
| 15 Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the    |
| Saviour.\                                                             |
| 16 They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they      |
| shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols.\             |
| 17 But Israel shall be saved in the LORD with an everlasting          |
| salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end.\ |
| 18 For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that |

| is none else.\                                                        |
