| 1 Let us now praise famous men, and our fathers that begat us.\       |
| 2 The Lord hath wrought great glory by them through his great power   |
| from the beginning.\                                                  |
| 3 Such as did bear rule in their kingdoms, men renowned for their     |
| power, giving counsel by their understanding, and declaring           |
| prophecies:\                                                          |

| learning meet for the people, wise and eloquent in their              |

| though they had never been; and are become as though they had never   |
| been born, and their children after them.\                            |
| 10 But these were merciful men, whose righteousness hath not been     |
| forgotten.\                                                           |

| in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.\                    |
| 39 And these all, having obtained a good report through faith,        |
| received not the promise:\                                            |

| 1 Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud  |
| of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth   |

| 1 Corinthians 4:1-16**\                                               |
| 1 Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and      |
| stewards of the mysteries of God.\                                    |
| 2 Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.\ |
| 3 But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of     |
| you, or of man\'s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.\          |
| 4 For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he |
| that judgeth me is the Lord.\                                         |
| 5 Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who   |
| both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make |
| manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have    |
| praise of God.\                                                       |
| 6 And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to       |
| myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not   |
| to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be    |
| puffed up for one against another.\                                   |
| 7 For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that |
| thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou   |
| glory, as if thou hadst not received it?\                             |
| 8 Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without  |
| us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with    |

| 9 For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it     |
| were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world,  |
| and to angels, and to men.\                                           |
| 10 We are fools for Christ\'s sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are |
| weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised.\     |
| 11 Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are    |
| naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;\          |
| 12 And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless;   |
| being persecuted, we suffer it:\                                      |
| 13 Being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world,  |
| and are the offscouring of all things unto this day.\                 |
| 14 I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I    |
| warn you.\                                                            |

| not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the |
