| **Psalm 60. Deus, repulisti nos.**\                                   |
| O GOD, thou hast cast us out, and scattered us abroad; \* thou hast   |
| also been displeased: O turn thee unto us again.\                     |
| 2 Thou hast moved the land, and divided it: \* heal the sores         |
| thereof, for it shaketh.\                                             |
| 3 Thou hast showed thy people heavy things; \* thou hast given us a   |
| drink of deadly wine.\                                                |
| 4 Thou hast given a token for such as fear thee, \* that they may     |
| triumph because of the truth.\                                        |
| 5 Therefore were thy beloved delivered; \* help me with thy right     |
| hand, and hear me.\                                                   |
| 6 God hath spoken in his holiness, I will rejoice, and divide         |
| Shechem, \* and mete out the valley of Succoth.\                      |
| 7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; \* Ephraim also is the        |
| strength of my head; Judah is my law-giver;\                          |
| 8 Moab is my wash-pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; \*          |
| Philistia, be thou glad of me.\                                       |
| 9 Who will lead me into the strong city? \* who will bring me into    |
| Edom?\                                                                |
| 10 Hast not thou cast us out, O God? \* wilt not thou, O God, go out  |
| with our hosts?\                                                      |
| 11 O be thou our help in trouble; \* for vain is the help of man.\    |
| 12 Through God will we do great acts; \* for it is he that shall      |
| tread down our enemies.                                               |
