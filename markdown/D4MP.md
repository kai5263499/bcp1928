**Psalm 19. Caeli enarrant.**\
THE heavens declare the glory of God; \* and the firmament showeth his
handy-work.\
2 One day telleth another; \* and one night certifieth another.\
3 There is neither speech nor language; \* but their voices are heard
among them.\
4 Their sound is gone out into all lands; \* and their words into the
ends of the world.\
5 In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun; \* which cometh forth as
a bridegroom out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a giant to run his
course.\
6 It goeth forth from the uttermost part of the heaven, and runneth
about unto the end of it again; \* and there is nothing hid from the
heat thereof.\
7 The law of the LORD is an undefiled law, converting the soul; \* the
testimony of the LORD is sure, and giveth wisdom unto the simple.\
8 The statutes of the LORD are right, and rejoice the heart; \* the
commandment of the LORD is pure, and giveth light unto the eyes.\
9 The fear of the LORD is clean, and endureth for ever; \* the judgments
of the LORD are true, and righteous altogether.\
10 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold; \*
sweeter also than honey, and the honeycomb.\
11 Moreover, by them is thy servant taught; \* and in keeping of them
there is great reward.\
12 Who can tell how oft he offendeth? \* O cleanse thou me from my
secret faults.\
13 Keep thy servant also from presumptuous sins, lest they get the
dominion over me; \* so shall I be undefiled, and innocent from the
great offence.\
14 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be alway
acceptable in thy sight, \* O LORD, my strength and my redeemer.

**Psalm 20. Exaudiat te Dominus.**\
THE LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; \* the Name of the God of
Jacob defend thee:\
2 Send thee help from the sanctuary, \* and strengthen thee out of
Sion:\
3 Remember all thy offerings, \* and accept thy burnt-sacrifice:\
4 Grant thee thy heart\'s desire, \* and fulfil all thy mind.\
5 We will rejoice in thy salvation, and triumph in the Name of the Lord
our God: \* the LORD perform all thy petitions.\
6 Now know I that the LORD helpeth his anointed, and will hear him from
his holy heaven, \* even with the wholesome strength of his right hand.\
7 Some put their trust in chariots, and some in horses; \* but we will
remember the Name of the LORD our God.\
8 They are brought down and fallen; \* but we are risen and stand
upright.\
9 Save, LORD; and hear us, O King of heaven, \* when we call upon thee.\

**Psalm 21. Domine, in virtute tua.**\
THE King shall rejoice in thy strength, O LORD; \* exceeding glad shall
he be of thy salvation.\
2 Thou hast given him his heart\'s desire, \* and hast not denied him
the request of his lips.\
3 For thou shalt meet him with the blessings of goodness, \* and shalt
set a crown of pure gold upon his head.\
4 He asked life of thee; and thou gavest him a long life, \* even for
ever and ever.\
5 His honour is great in thy salvation; \* glory and great worship shalt
thou lay upon him.\
6 For thou shalt give him everlasting felicity, \* and make him glad
with the joy of thy countenance.\
7 And why? because the King putteth his trust in the LORD; \* and in the
mercy of the Most Highest he shall not miscarry.\
8 All thine enemies shall feel thine hand; \* thy right hand shall find
out them that hate thee.\
9 Thou shalt make them like a fiery oven in time of thy wrath: \* the
LORD shall destroy them in his displeasure, and the fire shall consume
them.\
10 Their fruit shalt thou root out of the earth, \* and their seed from
among the children of men.\
11 For they intended mischief against thee, \* and imagined such a
device as they are not able to perform.\
12 Therefore shalt thou put them to flight, \* and the strings of thy
bow shalt thou make ready against the face of them.\
13 Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength; \* so will we sing, and
praise thy power.
