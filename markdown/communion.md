|  them to be partakers of the Lord\'s Table, until he know them to be  |
| reconciled. And if one of the parties, so at variance, be content to  |

| DEARLY beloved in the Lord, ye who mind to come to the holy Communion |
| of the Body and Blood of our Saviour Christ, must consider how Saint  |
| Paul exhorteth all persons diligently to try and examine themselves,  |
| before they presume to eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup. For  |
| as the benefit is great, if with a true penitent heart and lively     |
| faith we receive that holy Sacrament; so is the danger great, if we   |
| receive the same unworthily. Judge therefore yourselves, brethren,    |
| that ye be not judged of the Lord; repent you truly for your sins     |
| past; have a lively and stedfast faith in Christ our Saviour; amend   |
| your lives, and be in perfect charity with all men; so shall ye be    |
| meet partakers of those holy mysteries. And above all things ye must  |
| give most humble and hearty thanks to God, the Father, the Son, and   |
| the Holy Ghost, for the redemption of the world by the death and      |
| passion of our Saviour Christ, both God and man; who did humble       |
| himself, even to the death upon the Cross, for us, miserable sinners, |
| who lay in darkness and the shadow of death; that he might make us    |
| the children of God, and exalt us to everlasting life. And to the end |
| that we should always remember the exceeding great love of our        |
| Master, and only Saviour, Jesus Christ, thus dying for us, and the    |
| innumerable benefits which by his precious blood-shedding he hath     |
| obtained for us; he hath instituted and ordained holy mysteries, as   |
| pledges of his love, and for a continual remembrance of his death, to |
| our great and endless comfort. To him therefore, with the Father and  |
| the Holy Ghost, let us give, as we are most bounden, continual        |
| thanks; submitting ourselves wholly to his holy will and pleasure,    |
| and studying to serve him in true holiness and righteousness all the  |
| days of our life. Amen.                                               |

| # * ¶ When the Minister giveth warning for the Celebration of the Hol |
| y Communion, (which he shall always do upon the Sunday, or some Holy  |
| Day, immediately preceding,) he shall read this Exhortation following |
| ; or so much thereof as, in his discretion, he may think convenient.* |

| I purpose, through God\'s assistance, to administer to all such as    |
| shall be religiously and devoutly disposed the most comfortable       |
| Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ; to be by them received in  |
| remembrance of his meritorious Cross and Passion; whereby alone we    |
| obtain remission of our sins, and are made partakers of the Kingdom   |
| of heaven. Wherefore it is our duty to render most humble and hearty  |
| thanks to Almighty God, our heavenly Father, for that he hat given    |
| his Son our Saviour Jesus Christ, not only to die for us, but also to |
| be our spiritual food and sustenance in that holy Sacrament. Which    |
| being so divine and comfortable a thing to them who receive it        |
| worthily, and so dangerous to those who will presume to receive it    |
| unworthily; my duty is to exhort you, in the mean season to consider  |
| the dignity of that holy mystery, and the great peril of the unworthy |
| receiving thereof; and so to search and examine your own consciences, |
| and that not lightly, and after the manner of dissemblers with God;   |
| but so that ye may come holy and clean to such a heavenly Feast, in   |
| the marriage-garment required by God in holy Scripture, and be        |
| received as worthy partakers of that holy Table.\                     |
| \                                                                     |
| The way and means thereto is: First, to examine your lives and        |
| conversations by the rule of God\'s commandments; and whereinsoever   |
| ye shall perceive yourselves to have offended, either by will, word,  |
| or deed, there to bewail your own sinfulness, and to confess          |
| yourselves to Almighty God, with full purpose of amendment of life.   |
| And if ye shall perceive your offences to be such as are not only     |
| against God, but also against your neighbours; then ye shall          |
| reconcile yourselves unto them; being ready to make restitution and   |
| satisfaction, according to the uttermost of your powers, for all      |
| injuries and wrongs done by you to any other; and being likewise      |
| ready to forgive others who have offended you, as ye would have       |
| forgiveness of your offences at God\'s hand: for otherwise the        |
| receiving of the holy Communion doth nothing else but increase your   |
| condemnation. Therefore, if any of you be a blasphemer of God, an     |
| hinderer or slanderer of his Word, an adulterer, or be in malice, or  |
| envy, or in any other grievous crime; repent you of your sins, or     |
| else come not to that holy Table.\                                    |
| \                                                                     |
| And because it is requisite that no man should come to the holy       |
| Communion, but with a full trust in God\'s mercy, and with a quiet    |
| conscience; therefore, if there be any of you, who by this means      |
| cannot quiet his own conscience herein, but requireth further comfort |
| or counsel, let him come to me, or to some other Minister of God\'s   |
| Word, and open his grief; that he may receive such godly counsel and  |
| advice, as may tend to the quieting of his conscience, and the        |
| removing of all scruple and doubtfulness.                             |
|                                                                       |
| ##                                                                    |

| \                                                                     |
| DEARLY beloved brethren, on\--I intend, by God\'s grace, to celebrate |
| the Lord\'s Supper: unto which, in God\'s behalf, I bid you all who   |
| are here present; and beseech you, for the Lord Jesus Christ\'s sake, |
| that ye will not refuse to come thereto, being so lovingly called and |
| bidden by God himself. Ye know how grievous and unkind a thing it is, |
| when a man hath prepared a rich feast, decked his table with all kind |
| of provision, so that there lacketh nothing but the guests to sit     |
| down; and yet they who are called, without any cause, most            |
| unthankfully refuse to come. Which of you in such a case would not be |
| moved? Who would not think a great injury and wrong done unto him?    |
| Wherefore, most dearly beloved in Christ, take ye good heed, lest ye, |
| withdrawing yourselves from this holy Supper, provoke God\'s          |
| indignation against you. It is an easy matter for a man to say, I     |
| will not communicate, because I am otherwise hindered with worldly    |
| business. But such excuses are not so easily accepted and allowed     |
| before God. If any man say, I am a grievous sinner, and therefore am  |
| afraid to come: wherefore then do ye not repent and amend? When God   |
| calleth you, are ye not ashamed to say ye will not come? When ye      |
| should return to God, will ye excuse yourselves, and say ye are not   |
| ready? Consider earnestly with yourselves how little such feigned     |
| excuses will avail before God. Those who refused the feast in the     |
| Gospel, because they had bought a farm, or would try their yokes of   |
| oxen, or because they were married, were not so excused, but counted  |
| unworthy of the heavenly feast. Wherefore, according to mine office,  |
| I bid you in the Name of God, I call you in Christ\'s behalf, I       |
| exhort you, as ye love your own salvation, that ye will be partakers  |
| of this holy Communion. And as the Son of God did vouchsafe to yield  |
| up his soul by death upon the Cross for your salvation; so it is your |
| duty to receive the Communion in remembrance of the sacrifice of his  |
| death, as he himself hath commanded: which if ye shall neglect to do, |
| consider with yourselves how great is your ingratitude to God, and    |
| how sore punishment hangeth over your heads for the same; when ye     |
| wilfully abstain from the Lord\'s Table, and separate from your       |
| brethren, who come to feed on the banquet of that most heavenly food. |
| These things if ye earnestly consider, ye will by God\'s grace return |
| to a better mind: for the obtaining whereof we shall not cease to     |
| make our humble petitions unto Almighty God, our heavenly Father.\    |
|                                                                       |
