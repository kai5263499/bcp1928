| 1 When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus |
| made and baptized more disciples than John,\                          |
| 2 (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)\            |

| 4 And he must needs go through Samaria.\                              |
| 5 Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near   |
| to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.\           |
| 6 Now Jacob\'s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with    |
| his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.\  |
| 7 There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto     |
| her, Give me to drink.\                                               |
| 8 (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)\      |
| 9 Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou,      |
| being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the |
| Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.\                           |
| 10 Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, |
| and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest     |
| have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.\        |
| 11 The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and |
| the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?\      |
| 12 Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well,    |
| and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?\         |
| 13 Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water |
| shall thirst again:\                                                  |
| 14 But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall    |
| never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a   |
| well of water springing up into everlasting life.\                    |

| 23 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day,    |

| 1 After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to      |
| Jerusalem.\                                                           |
| 2 Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is      |
| called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.\           |
| 3 In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt,    |
| withered, waiting for the moving of the water.\                       |
| 4 For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and       |
| troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the   |
| water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.\        |
| 5 And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and      |
| eight years.\                                                         |
| 6 When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time   |
| in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?\            |
| 7 The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water   |
| is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another  |
| steppeth down before me.\                                             |

| 9 And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and    |
| walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.\                         |
| 10 The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath |
| day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.\                     |
| 11 He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me,    |
| Take up thy bed, and walk.\                                           |

| up thy bed, and walk?\                                                |
| 13 And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed |
| himself away, a multitude being in that place.\                       |
| 14 Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him,      |

| speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we are |

| surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and him   |
| that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured,   |
| and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the       |

| talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and |
| speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray  |
| you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the LORD.\      |
| 31 And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before  |
| thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do      |
| them: for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goeth |
| after their covetousness.\                                            |
| 32 And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath |
| a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they hear   |
| thy words, but they do them not.\                                     |

| sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.\       |

| 9 There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small   |
| fishes: but what are they among so many?\                             |
| 10 And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in |
| the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.\       |
| 11 And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he        |
| distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set |
| down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.\              |
| 12 When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the   |
| fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.\                         |
| 13 Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets   |
| with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and |

| bringeth evil to pass.\                                               |

| your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.\                          |
| 8 Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things    |
| are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure,   |
| whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report;   |
| if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these    |
| things.\                                                              |
| 9 Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard,  |
| and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.\          |
| 10 But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care |
| of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye     |
| lacked opportunity.\                                                  |
| 11 Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in        |
| whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.\                      |
| 12 I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every      |
| where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be     |
| hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.\                           |
| 13 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.\        |
| 14 Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my |
| affliction.\                                                          |
| 15 Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, |
| when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as     |
| concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.\                        |
| 16 For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my            |
| necessity.\                                                           |
| 17 Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to |
| your account.\                                                        |
| 18 But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of          |
| Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet |
| smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.\                  |
| 19 But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in   |
| glory by Christ Jesus.\                                               |
