| 1 And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he   |
| had slain all the prophets with the sword.\                           |
| 2 Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods  |
| do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of |
| them by tomorrow about this time.\                                    |
| 3 And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to  |
| Beer-sheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there.\    |
| 4 But he himself went a day\'s journey into the wilderness, and came  |
| and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that  |
| he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; |
| for I am not better than my fathers.\                                 |
| 5 And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel |
| touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.\                       |
| 6 And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baked on the coals,    |
| and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid  |
| him down again.\                                                      |
| 7 And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched   |
| him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for    |
| thee.\                                                                |
| 8 And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of    |
| that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.\   |
| 9 And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the |
| word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou   |
| here, Elijah?\                                                        |
| 10 And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts:   |
| for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down    |
| thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I    |
| only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.\               |
| 11 And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD.   |
| And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the |
| mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the     |
| LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the   |
| LORD was not in the earthquake:\                                      |
| 12 And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire: |
| and after the fire a still small voice.\                              |

| 3 But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:\         |

| ourselves your servants for Jesus\' sake.\                            |

| the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.\   |
| 31 And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the    |
| congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them.\          |

| 1 Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, |
| epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from      |
| you?\                                                                 |
| []{#anchor39004}2 Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and |
| read of all men:\                                                     |
| 3 Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ |
| ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the    |
| living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the       |
| heart.\                                                               |
| 4 And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:\                 |
| 5 Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of    |
| ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;\                            |
| 6 Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of   |
| the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit |
| giveth life.\                                                         |
| 7 But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones,   |
| was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly     |
| behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which      |
| glory was to be done away:\                                           |
| 8 How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?\   |
| 9 For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth    |
| the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.\                   |
| 10 For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this         |
| respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.\                      |
| 11 For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which  |
| remaineth is glorious.\                                               |
| 12 Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of      |
| speech:\                                                              |
| 13 And not as Moses, which put a veil over his face, that the         |
| children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which |
| is abolished:\                                                        |
| 14 But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the     |
| same veil untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which     |
| veil is done away in Christ.\                                         |
| 15 But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their |
| heart.\                                                               |
| 16 Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be     |
| taken away.\                                                          |
| 17 Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is,  |
| there is liberty.\                                                    |
| 18 But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of    |
| the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even   |

| same rule, let us mind the same thing.\                               |

| as ye have us for an example.\                                        |
