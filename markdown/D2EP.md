**Psalm 12. Salvum me fac.**\
HELP me, LORD, for there is not one godly man left; \* for the faithful
are minished from among the children of men.\
2 They talk of vanity every one with his neighbour; \* they do but
flatter with their lips, and dissemble in their double heart.\
3 The LORD shall root out all deceitful lips, \* and the tongue that
speaketh proud things;\
4 Which have said, With our tongue will we prevail; \* we are they that
ought to speak; who is lord over us?\
5 Now, for the comfortless troubles\' sake of the needy, \* and because
of the deep sighing of the poor,\
6 I will up, saith the LORD; \* and will help every one from him that
swelleth against him, and will set him at rest.\
7 The words of the LORD are pure words; \* even as the silver which from
the earth is tried, and purified seven times in the fire.\
8 Thou shalt keep them, O LORD; \* thou shalt preserve them from this
generation for ever.\
9 The ungodly walk on every side: \* when they are exalted, the children
of men are put to rebuke.

**Psalm 13. Usquequo, Domine?**\
HOW long wilt thou forget me, O LORD; for ever? \* how long wilt thou
hide thy face from me?\
2 How long shall I seek counsel in my soul, and be so vexed in my heart?
\* how long shall mine enemy triumph over me?\
3 Consider, and hear me, O LORD my God; \* lighten mine eyes, that I
sleep not in death;\
4 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him: \* for if I be cast
down, they that trouble me will rejoice at it.\
5 But my trust is in thy mercy, \* and my heart is joyful in thy
salvation.\
6 I will sing of the LORD, because he hath dealt so lovingly with me; \*
yea, I will praise the Name of the Lord Most Highest.\

**Psalm 14. Dixit insipiens.**\
THE fool hath said in his heart, \* There is no God.\
2 They are corrupt, and become abominable in their doings; \* there is
none that doeth good, no not one.\
3 The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, \* to see
if there were any that would understand, and seek after God.\
4 But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become
abominable; \* there is none that doeth good, no not one.\
5 Have they no knowledge, that they are all such workers of mischief, \*
eating up my people as it were bread, and call not upon the LORD?\
6 There were they brought in great fear, even where no fear was; \* for
God is in the generation of the righteous.\
7 As for you, ye have made a mock at the counsel of the poor; \* because
he putteth his trust in the LORD.\
8 Who shall give salvation unto Israel out of Sion? \* When the LORD
turneth the captivity of his people, then shall Jacob rejoice, and
Israel shall be glad.
