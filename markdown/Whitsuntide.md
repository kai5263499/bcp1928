| 2 For he will be found of them that tempt him not; and sheweth        |

| lively, clear, undefiled, plain, not subject to hurt, loving the      |
| thing that is good, quick, which cannot be letted, ready to do good,\ |

| most subtil, spirits.\                                                |

| through all things by reason of her pureness.\                        |
| 25 For she is the breath of the power of God, and a pure influence    |

| thing fall into her.\                                                 |

| mirror of the power of God, and the image of his goodness.\           |
| 27 And being but one, she can do all things: and remaining in         |
| herself, she maketh all things new: and in all ages entering into     |
| holy souls, she maketh them friends of God, and prophets.\            |
| 28 For God loveth none but him that dwelleth with wisdom.\            |

| 1 And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of    |
| speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.\        |
| 2 For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus        |
| Christ, and him crucified.\                                           |

| 4 And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of       |

| 5 That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the   |
| power of God.\                                                        |

| nought:\                                                              |

| 5 That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the   |
| power of God.\                                                        |
| 6 Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the    |
| wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to  |
| nought:\                                                              |
| 7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden        |
| wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:\          |
| 8 Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known    |
| it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.\                 |
| 9 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither     |
| have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath         |
| prepared for them that love him.\                                     |
| 10 But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit   |
| searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.\                   |
| 11 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man   |
| which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the    |
| Spirit of God.\                                                       |
| 12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit  |
| which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given  |
| to us of God.\                                                        |

| teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual      |
| things with spiritual.\                                               |
| 14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: |
| for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because  |
| they are spiritually discerned.\                                      |
| 15 But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is     |

| 1 Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, |
| epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from      |
| you?\                                                                 |

| men:\                                                                 |
| 3 Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ |
| ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the    |
| living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the       |
| heart.\                                                               |
| 4 And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:\                 |
| 5 Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of    |
| ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;\                            |
| 6 Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of   |
| the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit |
| giveth life.\                                                         |
| 7 But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones,   |
| was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly     |
| behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which      |
| glory was to be done away:\                                           |
| 8 How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?\   |
| 9 For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth    |
| the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.\                   |
| 10 For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this         |
| respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.\                      |
| 11 For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which  |
| remaineth is glorious.\                                               |

| 13 And not as Moses, which put a veil over his face, that the         |
| children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which |
| is abolished:\                                                        |
| 14 But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the     |
| same veil untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which     |
| veil is done away in Christ.\                                         |
| 15 But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their |

| and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of      |

| 3 I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, |
| that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night   |
| and day;\                                                             |
| 4 Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I    |
| may be filled with joy;\                                              |
| 5 When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee,     |
| which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and |
| I am persuaded that in thee also.\                                    |
| 6 Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of   |
| God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.\                 |
| []{#anchor2472629}7 For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but |
| of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.\                          |
| 8 Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of  |
| me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the       |
| gospel according to the power of God;\                                |
| 9 Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not          |
| according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace,   |
| which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,\           |
| 10 But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus     |
| Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and           |
| immortality to light through the gospel:\                             |
| 11 Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher |
| of the Gentiles.\                                                     |
| 12 For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am  |
| not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that   |
| he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that  |
| day.\                                                                 |
| 13 Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in |
| faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.\                             |
| 14 That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy     |
| Ghost which dwelleth in us.\                                          |

| 5 Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own      |
| selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, |
| except ye be reprobates?\                                             |
| 6 But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.\         |
| 7 Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear     |
| approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as |
| reprobates.\                                                          |

| 9 For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also |
| we wish, even your perfection.\                                       |
