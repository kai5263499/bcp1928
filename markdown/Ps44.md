| **Psalms 44. Deus, auribus.**\                                        |
| WE have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us \* what  |
| thou hast done in their time of old:\                                 |
| 2 How thou hast driven out the heathen with thy hand, and planted our |
| fathers in; \* how thou hast destroyed the nations, and made thy      |
| people to flourish.\                                                  |
| 3 For they gat not the land in possession through their own sword, \* |
| neither was it their own arm that helped them;\                       |
| 4 But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy             |
| countenance; \* because thou hadst a favour unto them.\               |
| 5 Thou art my King, O God; \* send help unto Jacob.\                  |
| 6 Through thee will we overthrow our enemies, \* and in thy Name will |
| we tread them under that rise up against us.\                         |
| 7 For I will not trust in my bow, \* it is not my sword that shall    |
| help me;\                                                             |
| 8 But it is thou that savest us from our enemies, \* and puttest them |
| to confusion that hate us.\                                           |
| 9 We make our boast of God all day long, \* and will praise thy Name  |
| for ever.\                                                            |
| 10 But now thou art far off, and puttest us to confusion, \* and      |
| goest not forth with our armies.\                                     |
| 11 Thou makest us to turn our backs upon our enemies, \* so that they |
| which hate us spoil our goods.\                                       |
| 12 Thou lettest us be eaten up like sheep, \* and hast scattered us   |
| among the heathen.\                                                   |
| 13 Thou sellest thy people for nought, \* and takest no money for     |
| them.\                                                                |
| 14 Thou makest us to be rebuked of our neighbours, \* to be laughed   |
| to scorn, and had in derision of them that are round about us.\       |
| 15 Thou makest us to be a by-word among the nations, \* and that the  |
| peoples shake their heads at us.\                                     |
| 16 My confusion is daily before me, \* and the shame of my face hath  |
| covered me;\                                                          |
| 17 For the voice of the slanderer and blasphemer, \* for the enemy    |
| and avenger.\                                                         |
| 18 And though all this be come upon us, yet do we not forget thee, \* |
| nor behave ourselves frowardly in thy covenant.\                      |
| 19 Our heart is not turned back, \* neither our steps gone out of thy |
| way;\                                                                 |
| 20 No, not when thou hast smitten us into the place of dragons, \*    |
| and covered us with the shadow of death.\                             |
| 21 If we have forgotten the Name of our God, and holden up our hands  |
| to any strange god, \* shall not God search it out? for he knoweth    |
| the very secrets of the heart.\                                       |
| 22 For thy sake also are we killed all the day long, \* and are       |
| counted as sheep appointed to be slain.\                              |
| 23 Up, Lord, why sleepest thou? \* awake, and be not absent from us   |
| for ever.\                                                            |
| 24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, \* and forgettest our misery and   |
| trouble?\                                                             |
| 25 For our soul is brought low, even unto the dust; \* our belly      |
| cleaveth unto the ground.\                                            |
| 26 Arise, and help us, \* and deliver us, for thy mercy\'s sake.      |
