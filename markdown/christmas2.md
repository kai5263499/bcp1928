| mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he    |
| will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law |
| shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.\     |
| 3 And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations     |
| afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their |
| spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against    |
| nation, neither shall they learn war any more.\                       |

| 1 Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering    |
| into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.\           |
| 2 For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the  |
| word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them |
| that heard it.\                                                       |
| []{#anchor507761}3 For we which have believed do enter into rest, as  |
| he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my     |
| rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the     |
| world.\                                                               |
| 4 For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise,    |
| And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.\                 |
| 5 And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.\         |
| 6 Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and     |
| they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of          |
| unbelief:\                                                            |
| 7 Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so |
| long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden  |
| not your hearts.\                                                     |
| 8 For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have  |
| spoken of another day.\                                               |
| 9 There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.\             |
| 10 For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his |
| own works, as God did from his.\                                      |
| 11 Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall |
| after the same example of unbelief.\                                  |
| []{#anchor509092}12 For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and   |

| 3 And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in   |

| 8 He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.\               |

| sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.\                    |
| 11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.\   |
| 12 No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God      |
| dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.\                     |

| given us of his Spirit.\                                              |

| the Saviour of the world.\                                            |

| in him, and he in God.\                                               |

| day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.\          |
| []{#anchor560823}18 There is no fear in love; but perfect love        |

| 1 Brethren, my heart\'s desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that  |
| they might be saved.\                                                 |
| 2 For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not        |
| according to knowledge.\                                              |
| 3 For they being ignorant of God\'s righteousness, and going about to |
| establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto |
| the righteousness of God.\                                            |
| 4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one     |
| that believeth.\                                                      |
| 5 For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That    |
| the man which doeth those things shall live by them.\                 |
| 6 But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say  |
| not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring  |
| Christ down from above:)\                                             |
| 7 Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ   |

| preach;\                                                              |
| 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt |
| believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou   |
| shalt be saved.\                                                      |
| 10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the  |
| mouth confession is made unto salvation.\                             |
| []{#anchor477588}11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on   |
| him shall not be ashamed.\                                            |
| 12 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the  |
| same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.\              |
| []{#anchor478558}13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the     |
| Lord shall be saved.\                                                 |
| 14 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?    |
| and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and    |
| how shall they hear without a preacher?\                              |
| []{#anchor479821}15 And how shall they preach, except they be sent?   |
| as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the  |

| 16 But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord,   |
| who hath believed our report?\                                        |
| 17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.\  |
| 18 But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into  |
| all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.\           |
| 19 But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke  |

| 2 And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, was not |
| this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before |
| unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, |
| slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the       |
| evil.\                                                                |

| till he might see what would become of the city.\                     |
| 6 And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over      |

| his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.\                 |

| smote the gourd that it withered.\                                    |

| thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a    |

| 17 And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild  |
| olive tree, wert grafted in among them, and with them partakest of    |
| the root and fatness of the olive tree;\                              |
| []{#anchor498455}18 Boast not against the branches. But if thou       |

| grafted in.\                                                          |
| []{#anchor499367}20 Well; because of unbelief they were broken off,   |
| and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:\             |
| 21 For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also |
| spare not thee.\                                                      |
| 22 Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which   |
| fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his    |
| goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.\                      |
| 23 And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be       |
| grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.\                  |
| 24 For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by        |
| nature, and wert grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree:   |
| how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be grafted  |
| into their own olive tree?\                                           |
