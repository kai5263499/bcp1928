| **Psalm 127. Nisi Dominus.**\                                         |
| EXCEPT the LORD build the house, \* their labour is but lost that     |
| build it.\                                                            |
| 2 Except the LORD keep the city, \* the watchman waketh but in vain.\ |
| 3 It is but lost labour that ye haste to rise up early, and so late   |
| take rest, and eat the bread of carefulness; \* for so he giveth his  |
| beloved sleep.\                                                       |
| 4 Lo, children, and the fruit of the womb, \* are an heritage and     |
| gift that cometh of the LORD.\                                        |
| 5 Like as the arrows in the hand of the giant, \* even so are the     |
| young children.\                                                      |
| 6 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them; \* they shall   |
| not be ashamed when they speak with their enemies in the gate.        |
