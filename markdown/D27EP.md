**Psalm 126. In convertendo.**\
WHEN the LORD turned again the captivity of Sion, then were we like unto
them that dream.\
2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, \* and our tongue with joy.\
3 Then said they among the heathen, \* The LORD hath done great things
for them.\
4 Yea, the LORD hath done great things for us already; \* whereof we
rejoice.\
5 Turn our captivity, O LORD, \* as the rivers in the south.\
6 They that sow in tears \* shall reap in joy.\
7 He that now goeth on his way weeping, and beareth forth good seed, \*
shall doubtless come again with joy, and bring his sheaves with him.\

**Psalm 127. Nisi Dominus.**\
EXCEPT the LORD build the house, \* their labour is but lost that build
it.\
2 Except the LORD keep the city, \* the watchman waketh but in vain.\
3 It is but lost labour that ye haste to rise up early, and so late take
rest, and eat the bread of carefulness; \* for so he giveth his beloved
sleep.\
4 Lo, children, and the fruit of the womb, \* are an heritage and gift
that cometh of the LORD.\
5 Like as the arrows in the hand of the giant, \* even so are the young
children.\
6 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them; \* they shall not
be ashamed when they speak with their enemies in the gate.\

**Psalm 128. Beati omnes.**\
BLESSED are all they that fear the LORD, \* and walk in his ways.\
2 For thou shalt eat the labours of thine hands: \* O well is thee, and
happy shalt thou be.\
3 Thy wife shall be as the fruitful vine \* upon the walls of thine
house;\
4 Thy children like the olive-branches \* round about thy table.\
5 Lo, thus shall the man be blessed \* that feareth the LORD.\
6 The LORD from out of Sion shall so bless thee, \* that thou shalt see
Jerusalem in prosperity all thy life long;\
7 Yea, that thou shalt see thy children\'s children, \* and peace upon
Israel.\

**Psalm 129. Saepe expugnaverunt.**\
MANY a time have they fought against me from my youth up, \* may Israel
now say;\
2 Yea, many a time have they vexed me from my youth up; \* but they have
not prevailed against me.\
3 The plowers plowed upon my back, \* and made long furrows.\
4 But the righteous LORD \* hath hewn the snares of the ungodly in
pieces.\
5 Let them be confounded and turned backward, \* as many as have evil
will at Sion.\
6 Let them be even as the grass upon the housetops, \* which withereth
afore it be grown up;\
7 Whereof the mower filleth not his hand, \* neither he that bindeth up
the sheaves his bosom.\
8 So that they who go by say not so much as, The LORD prosper you; \* we
wish you good luck in the Name of the LORD.\

**Psalm 130. De profundis.**\
OUT of the deep have I called unto thee, O LORD; \* Lord, hear my
voice.\
2 O let thine ears consider well \* the voice of my complaint.\
3 If thou, LORD, wilt be extreme to mark what is done amiss, \* O Lord,
who may abide it?\
4 For there is mercy with thee; \* therefore shalt thou be feared.\
5 I look for the LORD; my soul doth wait for him; \* in his word is my
trust.\
6 My soul fleeth unto the Lord before the morning watch; \* I say,
before the morning watch.\
7 O Israel, trust in the LORD; for with the LORD there is mercy, \* and
with him is plenteous redemption.\
8 And he shall redeem Israel \* from all his sins.\

**Psalm 131. Domine, non est.**\
LORD, I am not high-minded; \* I have no proud looks.\
2 I do not exercise myself in great matters \* which are too high for
me.\
3 But I refrain my soul, and keep it low, like as a child that is weaned
from his mother: \* yea, my soul is even as a weaned child.\
4 O Israel, trust in the LORD \* from this time forth for evermore.
