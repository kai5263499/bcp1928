**Psalm 9. Confitebor tibi.**\
I WILL give thanks unto thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; \* I will
speak of all thy marvellous works.\
2 I will be glad and rejoice in thee; \* yea, my songs will I make of
thy Name, O thou Most Highest.\
3 While mine enemies are driven back, \* they shall fall and perish at
thy presence.\
4 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; \* thou art set in the
throne that judgest right.\
5 Thou hast rebuked the heathen, and destroyed the ungodly; \* thou hast
put out their name for ever and ever.\
6 O thou enemy, thy destructions are come to a perpetual end; \* even as
the cities which thou hast destroyed, whose memorial is perished with
them.\
7 But the LORD shall endure for ever; \* he hath also prepared his seat
for judgment.\
8 For he shall judge the world in righteousness, \* and minister true
judgment unto the people.\
9 The LORD also will be a defence for the oppressed, \* even a refuge in
due time of trouble.\
10 And they that know thy Name will put their trust in thee; \* for
thou, LORD, hast never failed them that seek thee.\
11 O praise the LORD which dwelleth in Sion; \* show the people of his
doings.\
12 For when he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them, \* and
forgetteth not the complaint of the poor.\
13 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider the trouble which I suffer of
them that hate me, \* thou that liftest me up from the gates of death;\
14 That I may show all thy praises within the gates of the daughter of
Sion: \* I will rejoice in thy salvation.\
15 The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made; \* in the same
net which they hid privily is their foot taken.\
16 The LORD is known to execute judgment; \* the ungodly is trapped in
the work of his own hands.\
17 The wicked shall be turned to destruction, \* and all the people that
forget God.\
18 For the poor shall not alway be forgotten; \* the patient abiding of
the meek shall not perish for ever.\
19 UP, LORD, and let not man have the upper hand; \* let the heathen be
judged in thy sight.\
20 Put them in fear, O LORD, \* that the heathen may know themselves to
be but men.\

**Psalm 10. Ut quid, Domine?**\
WHY standest thou so far off, O LORD, \* and hidest thy face in the
needful time of trouble?\
2 The ungodly, for his own lust, doth persecute the poor: \* let them be
taken in the crafty wiliness that they have imagined.\
3 For the ungodly hath made boast of his own heart\'s desire, \* and
speaketh good of the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.\
4 The ungodly is so proud, that he careth not for God, \* neither is God
in all his thoughts.\
5 His ways are alway grievous; \* thy judgments are far above out of his
sight, and therefore defieth he all his enemies.\
6 For he hath said in his heart, Tush, I shall never be cast down, \*
there shall no harm happen unto me.\
7 His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and fraud; \* under his tongue
is ungodliness and vanity.\
8 He sitteth lurking in the thievish corners of the streets, \* and
privily in his lurking dens doth he murder the innocent; his eyes are
set against the poor.\
9 For he lieth waiting secretly; even as a lion lurketh he in his den,
\* that he may ravish the poor.\
10 He doth ravish the poor, \* when he getteth him into his net.\
11 He falleth down, and humbleth himself, \* that the congregation of
the poor may fall into the hands of his captains.\
12 He hath said in his heart, Tush, God hath forgotten; \* he hideth
away his face, and he will never see it.\
13 Arise, O LORD God, and lift up thine hand; \* forget not the poor.\
14 Wherefore should the wicked blaspheme God, \* while he doth say in
his heart, Tush, thou God carest not for it?\
15 Surely thou hast seen it; \* for thou beholdest ungodliness and
wrong, that thou mayest take the matter into thy hand.\
16 The poor committeth himself unto thee; \* for thou art the helper of
the friendless.\
17 Break thou the power of the ungodly and malicious; \* search out his
ungodliness, until thou find none.\
18 The LORD is King for ever and ever, \* and the heathen are perished
out of the land.\
19 LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the poor; \* thou preparest their
heart, and thine ear hearkeneth;\
20 To help the fatherless and poor unto their right, \* that the man of
the earth be no more exalted against them.

**Psalm 11. In Domino confido.**\
IN the LORD put I my trust; \* how say ye then to my soul, that she
should flee as a bird unto the hill?\
2 For lo, the ungodly bend their bow, and make ready their arrows within
the quiver, \* that they may privily shoot at them which are true of
heart.\
3 If the foundations be destroyed, \* what can the righteous do?\
4 The LORD is in his holy temple; \* the LORD\'S seat is in heaven.\
5 His eyes consider the poor, \* and his eyelids try the children of
men.\
6 The LORD approveth the righteous: \* but the ungodly, and him that
delighteth in wickedness, doth his soul abhor.\
7 Upon the ungodly he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, storm and
tempest: \* this shall be their portion to drink.\
8 For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; \* his countenance will
behold the thing that is just.
