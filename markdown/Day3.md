| **Psalm 15. Domine, quis habitabit?**\                                |
| LORD, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? \* or who shall rest upon    |
| thy holy hill?\                                                       |
| 2 Even he that leadeth an uncorrupt life, \* and doeth the thing      |
| which is right, and speaketh the truth from his heart.\               |
| 3 He that hath used no deceit in his tongue, nor done evil to his     |
| neighbour, \* and hath not slandered his neighbour.\                  |
| 4 He that setteth not by himself, but is lowly in his own eyes, \*    |
| and maketh much of them that fear the LORD.\                          |
| 5 He that sweareth unto his neighbour, and disappointeth him not, \*  |
| though it were to his own hindrance.\                                 |
| 6 He that hath not given his money upon usury, \* nor taken reward    |
| against the innocent.\                                                |
| 7 Whoso doeth these things \* shall never fall.\                      |
| \                                                                     |
| **\                                                                   |
| Psalm 16. Conserva me, Domine.**\                                     |
| PRESERVE me, O God; \* for in thee have I put my trust.\              |
| 2 O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, \* Thou art my God; I have |
| no good like unto thee.\                                              |
| 3 All my delight is upon the saints that are in the earth, \* and     |
| upon such as excel in virtue.\                                        |
| 4 But they that run after another god \* shall have great trouble.\   |
| 5 Their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, \* neither make    |
| mention of their names within my lips.\                               |
| 6 The LORD himself is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup; |
| \* thou shalt maintain my lot.\                                       |
| 7 The lot is fallen unto me in a fair ground; \* yea, I have a goodly |
| heritage.\                                                            |
| 8 I will thank the LORD for giving me warning; \* my reins also       |
| chasten me in the night season.\                                      |
| 9 I have set the LORD alway before me; \* for he is on my right hand, |
| therefore I shall not fall.\                                          |
| 10 Wherefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: \* my flesh    |
| also shall rest in hope.\                                             |
| 11 For why? thou shalt not leave my soul in hell; \* neither shalt    |
| thou suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.\                          |
| 12 Thou shalt show me the path of life: in thy presence is the        |
| fulness of joy, \* and at thy right hand there is pleasure for        |
| evermore.\                                                            |

| Psalm 17. Exaudi, Domine.**\                                          |
| HEAR the right, O LORD, consider my complaint, \* and hearken unto my |
| prayer, that goeth not out-of feigned lips.\                          |
| 2 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; \* and let thine eyes |
| look upon the thing that is equal.\                                   |
| 3 Thou hast proved and visited mine heart in the night season; thou   |
| hast tried me, and shalt find no wickedness in me; \* for I am        |
| utterly purposed that my mouth shall not offend.\                     |
| 4 As for the works of men, \* by the word of thy lips I have kept me  |
| from the ways of the destroyer.\                                      |
| 5 O hold thou up my goings in thy paths, \* that my footsteps slip    |
| not.\                                                                 |
| 6 I have called upon thee, O God, for thou shalt hear me: \* incline  |
| thine ear to me, and hearken unto my words.\                          |
| 7 Show thy marvellous loving-kindness, thou that art the Saviour of   |
| them which put their trust in thee, \* from such as resist thy right  |
| hand.\                                                                |
| 8 Keep me as the apple of an eye; \* hide me under the shadow of thy  |
| wings,\                                                               |
| 9 From the ungodly, that trouble me; \* mine enemies compass me round |
| about, to take away my soul.\                                         |
| 10 They are inclosed in their own fat, \* and their mouth speaketh    |
| proud things.\                                                        |
| 11 They lie waiting in our way on every side, \* watching to cast us  |
| down to the ground;\                                                  |
| 12 Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, \* and as it were a     |
| lion\'s whelp lurking in secret places.\                              |
| 13 Up, LORD, disappoint him, and cast him down; \* deliver my soul    |
| from the ungodly, by thine own sword;\                                |
| 14 Yea, by thy hand, O LORD; from the men of the evil world; \* which |
| have their portion in this life, whose bellies thou fillest with thy  |
| hid treasure.\                                                        |
| 15 They have children at their desire, \* and leave the rest of their |
| substance for their babes.\                                           |
| 16 But as for me, I shall behold thy presence in righteousness; \*    |
| and when I awake up after thy likeness, I shall be satisfied.\        |
|                                                                       |

|                                                                       |
| **Psalm 18. Diligam te, Domine.**\                                    |
| I WILL love thee, O LORD, my strength. \* The LORD is my stony rock,  |
| and my defence;\                                                      |
| 2 My Saviour, my God, and my might, in whom I will trust; \* my       |
| buckler, the horn also of my salvation, and my refuge.\               |
| 3 I will call upon the LORD, which is worthy to be praised; \* so     |
| shall I be safe from mine enemies.\                                   |
| 4 The sorrows of death compassed me, \* and the overflowings of       |
| ungodliness made me afraid.\                                          |
| 5 The pains of hell came about me; \* the snares of death overtook    |
| me.\                                                                  |
| 6 In my trouble I called upon the LORD, \* and complained unto my     |
| God:\                                                                 |
| 7 So he heard my voice out of his holy temple, \* and my complaint    |
| came before him; it entered even into his ears.\                      |
| 8 The earth trembled and quaked, \* the very foundations also of the  |
| hills shook, and were removed, because he was wroth.\                 |
| 9 There went a smoke out in his presence, \* and a consuming fire out |
| of his mouth, so that coals were kindled at it.\                      |
| 10 He bowed the heavens also, and came down, \* and it was dark under |
| his feet.\                                                            |
| 11 He rode upon the Cherubim, and did fly; \* he came flying upon the |
| wings of the wind.\                                                   |
| 12 He made darkness his secret place, \* his pavilion round about him |
| with dark water, and thick clouds to cover him.\                      |
| 13 At the brightness of his presence his clouds removed; \*           |
| hailstones and coals of fire.\                                        |
| 14 The LORD also thundered out of heaven, and the Highest gave his    |
| thunder; \* hailstones and coals of fire.\                            |
| 15 He sent out his arrows, and scattered them; \* he cast forth       |
| lightnings, and destroyed them.\                                      |
| 16 The springs of waters were seen, and the foundations of the round  |
| world were discovered, \* at thy chiding, O LORD, at the blasting of  |
| the breath of thy displeasure.\                                       |
| 17 He sent down from on high to fetch me, \* and took me out of many  |
| waters.\                                                              |
| 18 He delivered me from my strongest enemy, and from them which hate  |
| me; \* for they were too mighty for me.\                              |
| 19 They came upon me in the day of my trouble; \* but the LORD was my |
| upholder.\                                                            |
| 20 He brought me forth also into a place of liberty; \* he brought me |
| forth, even because he had a favour unto me.\                         |
| 21 The LORD rewarded me after my righteous dealing, \* according to   |
| the cleanness of my hands did he recompense me.\                      |
| 22 Because I have kept the ways of the LORD, \* and have not forsaken |
| my God, as the wicked doth.\                                          |
| 23 For I have an eye unto all his laws, \* and will not cast out his  |
| commandments from me.\                                                |
| 24 I was also uncorrupt before him, \* and eschewed mine own          |
| wickedness.\                                                          |
| 25 Therefore the LORD rewarded me after my righteous dealing, \* and  |
| according unto the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.\            |
| 26 With the holy thou shalt be holy, \* and with a perfect man thou   |
| shalt be perfect.\                                                    |
| 27 With the clean thou shalt be clean, \* and with the froward thou   |
| shalt be froward.\                                                    |
| 28 For thou shalt save the people that are in adversity, and shalt    |
| bring down the high looks of the proud.\                              |
| 29 Thou also shalt light my candle; \* the LORD my God shall make my  |
| darkness to be light.\                                                |
| 30 For in thee I shall discomfit an host of men, \* and with the help |
| of my God I shall leap over the wall.\                                |
| 31 The way of God is an undefiled way: \* the word of the LORD also   |
| is tried in the fire; he is the defender of all them that put their   |
| trust in him.\                                                        |
| 32 For who is God, but the LORD? \* or who hath any strength, except  |
| our God?\                                                             |
| 33 It is God that girdeth me with strength of war, \* and maketh my   |
| way perfect.\                                                         |
| 34 He maketh my feet like harts\' feet, \* and setteth me up on       |
| high.\                                                                |
| 35 He teacheth mine hands to fight, \* and mine arms shall bend even  |
| a bow of steel.\                                                      |
| 36 Thou hast given me the defence of thy salvation; \* thy right hand |
| also shall hold me up, and thy loving correction shall make me        |
| great.\                                                               |
| 37 Thou shalt make room enough under me for to go, \* that my         |
| footsteps shall not slide.\                                           |
| 38 I will follow upon mine enemies, and overtake them; \* neither     |
| will I turn again till I have destroyed them.\                        |
| 39 I will smite them, that they shall not be able to stand, \* but    |
| fall under my feet.\                                                  |
| 40 Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle; \* thou shalt   |
| throw down mine enemies under me.\                                    |
| 41 Thou hast made mine enemies also to turn their backs upon me, \*   |
| and I shall destroy them that hate me.\                               |
| 42 They shall cry, but there shall be none to help them; \* yea, even |
| unto the LORD shall they cry, but he shall not hear them.\            |
| 43 I will beat them as small as the dust before the wind: \* I will   |
| cast them out as the clay in the streets.\                            |
| 44 Thou shalt deliver me from the strivings of the people, \* and     |
| thou shalt make me the head of the nations; a people whom I have not  |
| known shall serve me.\                                                |
| 45 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me; \* the strangers   |
| shall feign obedience unto me.\                                       |
| 46 The strangers shall fail, \* and come trembling out of their       |
| strongholds.\                                                         |
| 47 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my strong helper, \* and praised   |
