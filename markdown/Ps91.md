| **Psalm 91. Qui habitat.**\                                           |
| WHOSO dwelleth under the defence of the Most High, \* shall abide     |
| under the shadow of the Almighty.\                                    |
| 2 I will say unto the LORD, Thou art my hope, and my stronghold; \*   |
| my God, in him will I trust.\                                         |
| 3 For he shall deliver thee from the snare of the hunter, \* and from |
| the noisome pestilence.\                                              |
| 4 He shall defend thee under his wings, and thou shalt be safe under  |
| his feathers; \* his faithfulness and truth shall be thy shield and   |
| buckler.\                                                             |
| 5 Thou shalt not be afraid for any terror by night, \* nor for the    |
| arrow that flieth by day;\                                            |
| 6 For the pestilence that walketh in darkness, \* nor for the         |
| sickness that destroyeth in the noon-day.\                            |
| 7 A thousand shall fall beside thee, and ten thousand at thy right    |
| hand; \* but it shall not come nigh thee.\                            |
| 8 Yea, with thine eyes shalt thou behold, \* and see the reward of    |
| the ungodly.\                                                         |
| 9 For thou, LORD, art my hope; \* thou hast set thine house of        |
| defence very high.\                                                   |
| 10 There shall no evil happen unto thee, \* neither shall any plague  |
| come nigh thy dwelling.\                                              |
| 11 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, \* to keep thee in  |
| all thy ways.\                                                        |
| 12 They shall bear thee in their hands, \* that thou hurt not thy     |
| foot against a stone.\                                                |
| 13 Thou shalt go upon the lion and adder: \* the young lion and the   |
| dragon shalt thou tread under thy feet.\                              |
| 14 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver     |
| him; \* I will set him up, because he hath known my Name.\            |
| 15 He shall call upon me, and I will hear him; \* yea, I am with him  |
| in trouble; I will deliver him, and bring him to honour.\             |
| 16 With long life will I satisfy him, \* and show him my salvation.   |
