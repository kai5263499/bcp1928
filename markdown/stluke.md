| ALMIGHTY God, who didst inspire thy servant Saint Luke the Physician, |
| to set forth in the Gospel the love and healing power of thy Son;     |
| Manifest in thy Church the like power and love, to the healing of our |
| bodies and our souls; through the same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. |
| Amen.\                                                                |
|                                                                       |
| The Epistle. 2 Timothy iv. 5.                                         |
|                                                                       |
| WATCH thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an       |
| evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry. For I am now ready to be |
| offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a     |
| good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:         |
| henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which    |
| the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to  |
| me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing. Do thy       |
| diligence to come shortly unto me: for Demas hath forsaken me, having |
| loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens |
| to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia. Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and |
| bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry. And |
| Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus. The cloke that I left at Troas with  |
| Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, but         |
| especially the parchments. Alexander the coppersmith did me much      |
| evil: the Lord reward him according to his works: of whom be thou     |
| ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.\                  |
|                                                                       |
| The Gospel. St. Luke x. 1.                                            |

| THE Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two      |
| before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would   |
| come. Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but    |
| the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest,     |
| that he would send forth labourers into his harvest. Go your ways:    |
| behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves. Carry neither purse,  |
| nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way. And into          |
| whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house. And if  |
| the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it  |
| shall turn to you again. And in the same house remain, eating and     |
| drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his  |
| hire.                                                                 |
