| know him not see his days?\                                           |
| 2 Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and     |
| feed thereof.\                                                        |
| 3 They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow\'s   |
| ox for a pledge.\                                                     |
| 4 They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide      |
| themselves together.\                                                 |
| 5 Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work;   |
| rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and  |
| for their children.\                                                  |

| vintage of the wicked.\                                               |

| covering in the cold.\                                                |

| rock for want of a shelter.\                                          |

| 12 Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth |
| out: yet God layeth not folly to them.\                               |
| 13 They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the  |
| ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.\                        |
| 14 The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and |
| in the night is as a thief.\                                          |
| 15 The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No |
| eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.\                           |
| 16 In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for     |
| themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.\                  |
| 17 For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one     |
| know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.\           |

| 1 This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or   |

| 9 For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also |
| we wish, even your perfection.\                                       |

| should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath      |
| given me to edification, and not to destruction.\                     |

| Father which is in heaven.\                                           |

| 25 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will |
| lose his life for my sake shall find it.\                             |

| the children free.\                                                   |

| 29 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to |
| Ramoth-gilead.\                                                       |
| 30 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise      |
| myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the |
| king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.\          |
| 31 But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that   |
| had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor      |
| great, save only with the king of Israel.\                            |
| 32 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw         |
| Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel. And     |
| they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.\   |
| 33 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived   |
| that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from        |
| pursuing him.\                                                        |
| 34 And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of   |
| Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the  |
| driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; |
| for I am wounded.\                                                    |
| 35 And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in   |
| his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran  |
| out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.\                      |
| 36 And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going  |
| down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his  |
| own country.\                                                         |

| king in Samaria.\                                                     |

| thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.\     |
| 5 And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha,   |
| and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy      |
| master from thy head today? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye  |

| afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.\                              |

| went over on dry ground.\                                             |

| unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away     |
| from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy  |

| not, it shall not be so.\                                             |

| of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he   |
| took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.\           |
| 13 He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went  |
| back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;\                               |
| 14 And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the |

| 3 Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but      |
| patient, not a brawler, not covetous;\                                |

| condemnation of the devil.\                                           |
| 7 Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest |
| he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.\                    |
| 8 Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to |
| much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;\                               |
| 9 Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.\             |
| 10 And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office   |
| of a deacon, being found blameless.\                                  |
| 11 Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful |
| in all things.\                                                       |

| and their own houses well.\                                           |

| 1 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he |
| departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond      |
| Jordan;\                                                              |
| 2 And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.\       |
| 3 The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto     |
| him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?\    |
| 4 And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which |
| made them at the beginning made them male and female,\                |
| 5 And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and   |
| shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?\         |
| 6 Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God |
| hath joined together, let not man put asunder.\                       |
| 7 They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of  |
| divorcement, and to put her away?\                                    |
| 8 He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts    |
| suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was    |
| not so.\                                                              |
| 9 And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be |
| for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and    |
| whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.\           |
| 10 His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his  |
| wife, it is not good to marry.\                                       |
| 11 But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save    |
| they to whom it is given.\                                            |
| 12 For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their          |
| mother\'s womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs   |
| of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for  |
| the kingdom of heaven\'s sake. He that is able to receive it, let him |
| receive it.\                                                          |
| []{#anchor666010}13 Then were there brought unto him little children, |
| that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples     |
| rebuked them.\                                                        |
| 14 But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to    |
| come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.\                  |
| 15 And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.\               |
