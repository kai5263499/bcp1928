**Psalm 27. Dominus illuminatio.**\
THE LORD is my light and my salvation; whom then shall I fear? \* the
LORD is the strength of my life; of whom then shall I be afraid?\
2 When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up
my flesh, \* they stumbled and fell.\
3 Though an host of men were laid against me, yet shall not my heart be
afraid; \* and though there rose up war against me, yet will I put my
trust in him.\
4 One thing have I desired of the LORD, which I will require; \* even
that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to
behold the fair beauty of the LORD, and to visit his temple.\
5 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his tabernacle; \* yea,
in the secret place of his dwelling shall he hide me, and set me up upon
a rock of stone.\
6 And now shall he lift up mine head \* above mine enemies round about
me.\
7 Therefore will I offer in his dwelling an oblation, with great
gladness: \* I will sing and speak praises unto the LORD.\
8 Hearken unto my voice, O LORD, when I cry unto thee; \* have mercy
upon me, and hear me.\
9 My heart hath talked of thee, Seek ye my face: \* Thy face, LORD, will
I seek.\
10 O hide not thou thy face from me, \* nor cast thy servant away in
displeasure.\
11 Thou hast been my succour; \* leave me not, neither forsake me, O God
of my salvation.\
12 When my father and my mother forsake me, \* the LORD taketh me up.\
13 Teach me thy way, O LORD, \* and lead me in the right way, because of
mine enemies.\
14 Deliver me not over into the will of mine adversaries: \* for there
are false witnesses risen up against me, and such as speak wrong.\
15 I should utterly have fainted, \* but that I believe verily to see
the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.\
16 O tarry thou the LORD\'S leisure; \* be strong, and he shall comfort
thine heart; and put thou thy trust in the LORD.\

**Psalm 28. Ad te, Domine.**\
UNTO thee will I cry, O LORD, my strength: \* think no scorn of me;
lest, if thou make as though thou hearest not, I become like them that
go down into the pit.\
2 Hear the voice of my humble petitions, when I cry unto thee; \* when I
hold up my hands towards the mercyseat of thy holy temple.\
3 O pluck me not away, neither destroy me with the ungodly and wicked
doers, \* which speak friendly to their neighbours, but imagine mischief
in their hearts.\
4 Reward them according to their deeds, \* and according to the
wickedness of their own inventions.\
5 Recompense them after the work of their hands; \* pay them that they
have deserved.\
6 For they regard not in their mind the works of the LORD, nor the
operation of his hands; \* therefore shall he break them down, and not
build them up.\
7 Praised be the LORD; \* for he hath heard the voice of my humble
petitions.\
8 The LORD is my strength, and my shield; my heart hath trusted in him,
and I am helped; \* therefore my heart danceth for joy, and in my song
will I praise him.\
9 The LORD is my strength, \* and he is the wholesome defence of his
anointed.\
10 O save thy people, and give thy blessing unto thine inheritance: \*
feed them, and set them up for ever.\

**Psalm 29. Afferte Domino.**\
A SCRIBE unto the LORD, O ye mighty, \* ascribe unto the LORD worship
and strength.\
2 Ascribe unto the LORD the honour due unto his Name; \* worship the
LORD with holy worship.\
3 The voice of the LORD is upon the waters; \* it is the glorious God
that maketh the thunder.\
4 It is the LORD that ruleth the sea; the voice of the LORD is mighty in
operation; \* the voice of the LORD is a glorious voice.\
5 The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedar-trees; \* yea, the LORD
breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.\
6 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; \* Lebanon also, and Sirion,
like a young unicorn.\
7 The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire; the voice of the
LORD shaketh the wilderness; \* yea, the LORD shaketh the wilderness of
Kadesh.\
8 The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to bring forth young, and
strippeth bare the forests: \* in his temple doth every thing speak of
his honour.\
9 The LORD sitteth above the water-flood, \* and the LORD remaineth a
King for ever.\
10 The LORD shall give strength unto his people; \* the LORD shall give
his people the blessing of peace.
