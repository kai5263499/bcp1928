| O ALMIGHTY God, who hast knit together thine elect in one communion   |
| and fellowship, in the mystical body of thy Son Christ our Lord;      |
| Grant us grace so to follow thy blessed Saints in all virtuous and    |
| godly living, that we may come to those unspeakable joys which thou   |

| For the Epistle. Revelation vii. 2.                                   |

| AND I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of   |
| the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to |
| whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, saying, Hurt not the |
| earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the        |
| servants of our God in their foreheads. And I heard the number of     |
| them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty    |
| and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel. After  |
| this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, |
| of all nations, and kindreds, and peoples, and tongues, stood before  |
| the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms  |
| in their hands; and cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our |
| God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb. And all the     |
| angels stood round about the throne, and about the elders and the     |
| four living creatures, and fell before the throne on their faces, and |
| worshipped God, saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and    |
| thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our God for   |
| ever and ever. Amen. And one of the elders answered, saying unto me,  |
| What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came      |
| they? And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me,      |
| These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed   |
| their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore  |
| are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his |
| temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them.     |
| They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the |
| sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst   |
| of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living        |
| fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their     |
| eyes.\                                                                |

| JESUS seeing the multitudes, went up into a mountain: and when he was |
| set, his disciples came unto him: and he opened his mouth, and taught |
| them, saying, Blessed are the poor in spirit: for their\'s is the     |
| kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be     |
| comforted. Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.    |
| Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for  |
| they shall be filled. Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain |
| mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. Blessed |
| are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.    |
| Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness\' sake: for   |
| their\'s is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye, when men shall     |
| revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil       |
| against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for |
| great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets   |
| which were before you.                                                |
