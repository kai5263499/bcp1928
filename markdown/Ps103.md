| **Psalm 103. Benedic, anima mea.**\                                   |
| PRAISE the LORD, O my soul; \* and all that is within me, praise his  |
| holy Name.\                                                           |
| 2 Praise the LORD, O my soul, \* and forget not all his benefits:\    |
| 3 Who forgiveth all thy sin, \* and healeth all thine infirmities;\   |
| 4 Who saveth thy life from destruction, \* and crowneth thee with     |
| mercy and loving-kindness;\                                           |
| 5 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things, \* making thee young and |
| lusty as an eagle.\                                                   |
| 6 The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment \* for all them that  |
| are oppressed with wrong.\                                            |
| 7 He showed his ways unto Moses, \* his works unto the children of    |
| Israel.\                                                              |
| 8 The LORD is full of compassion and mercy, \* longsuffering, and of  |
| great goodness.\                                                      |
| 9 He will not alway be chiding; \* neither keepeth he his anger for   |
| ever.\                                                                |
| 10 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; \* nor rewarded us       |
| according to our wickednesses.\                                       |
| 11 For look how high the heaven is in comparison of the earth; \* so  |
| great is his mercy also toward them that fear him.\                   |
| 12 Look how wide also the east is from the west; \* so far hath he    |
| set our sins from us.\                                                |
| 13 Yea, like as a father pitieth his own children; \* even so is the  |
| LORD merciful unto them that fear him.\                               |
| 14 For he knoweth whereof we are made; \* he remembereth that we are  |
| but dust.\                                                            |
| 15 The days of man are but as grass; \* for he flourisheth as a       |
| flower of the field.\                                                 |
| 16 For as soon as the wind goeth over it, it is gone; \* and the      |
| place thereof shall know it no more.\                                 |
| 17 But the merciful goodness of the LORD endureth for ever and ever   |
| upon them that fear him; \* and his righteousness upon children\'s    |
| children;\                                                            |
| 18 Even upon such as keep his covenant, \* and think upon his         |
| commandments to do them.\                                             |
| 19 The LORD hath prepared his seat in heaven, \* and his kingdom      |
| ruleth over all.\                                                     |
| 20 O praise the LORD, ye angels of his, ye that excel in strength; \* |
| ye that fulfil his commandment, and hearken unto the voice of his     |
| word.\                                                                |
| 21 O praise the LORD, all ye his hosts; \* ye servants of his that do |
| his pleasure.\                                                        |
| 22 O speak good of the LORD, all ye works of his, in all places of    |
| his dominion: \* praise thou the LORD, O my soul.                     |
