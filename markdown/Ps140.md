| **Psalm 140. Eripe me, Domine.**\                                     |
| DELIVER me, O LORD, from the evil man; \* and preserve me from the    |
| wicked man;\                                                          |
| 2 Who imagine mischief in their hearts, \* and stir up strife all the |
| day long.\                                                            |
| 3 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; \* adder\'s       |
| poison is under their lips.\                                          |
| 4 Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the ungodly; \* preserve me from |
| the wicked men, who are purposed to overthrow my goings.\             |
| 5 The proud have laid a snare for me, and spread a net abroad with    |
| cords; \* yea, and set traps in my way.\                              |
| 6 I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God, \* hear the voice of my      |
| prayers, O LORD.\                                                     |
| 7 O LORD God, thou strength of my health; \* thou hast covered my     |
| head in the day of battle.\                                           |
| 8 Let not the ungodly have his desire, O LORD; \* let not his         |
| mischievous imagination prosper, lest they be too proud.\             |
| 9 Let the mischief of their own lips fall upon the head of them \*    |
| that compass me about.\                                               |
| 10 Let hot burning coals fall upon them; \* let them be cast into the |
| fire, and into the pit, that they never rise up again.\               |
| 11 A man full of words shall not prosper upon the earth: \* evil      |
| shall hunt the wicked person to overthrow him.\                       |
| 12 Sure I am that the LORD will avenge the poor, \* and maintain the  |
| cause of the helpless.\                                               |
| 13 The righteous also shall give thanks unto thy Name; \* and the     |
| just shall continue in thy sight.                                     |
