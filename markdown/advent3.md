| 5 Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou      |
| camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a |

| to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou     |
| shalt speak.\                                                         |

| 9 Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the     |
| LORD said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.\         |
| 10 See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the        |
| kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw |
| down, to build, and to plant.\                                        |
| 17 Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them   |
| all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I       |
| confound thee before them.\                                           |
| 18 For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an     |
| iron pillar, and brazen walls against the whole land, against the     |
| kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests      |
| thereof, and against the people of the land.\                         |

| 57 Now Elisabeth\'s full time came that she should be delivered; and  |
| she brought forth a son.\                                             |

| called by this name.\                                                 |

| John. And they marvelled all.\                                        |

| and will not at all acquit the wicked: the LORD hath his way in the   |
| whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.\ |
| 4 He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the       |
| rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon     |
| languisheth.\                                                         |
| 5 The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is    |
| burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein.\  |
| 6 Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the      |
| fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the    |
| rocks are thrown down by him.\                                        |

| 7 Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a     |
| vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a       |
| flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?\                      |
| 8 Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?\   |
| []{#anchor96989}9 For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt   |
| not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God   |
| take care for oxen?\                                                  |
| []{#anchor98954}10 Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our   |
| sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in |
| hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his    |
| hope.\                                                                |
| 11 If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if  |
| we shall reap your carnal things?\                                    |
| 12 If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather?  |
| Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest |
| we should hinder the gospel of Christ.\                               |
| 13 Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of  |
| the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are        |
| partakers with the altar?\                                            |
| 14 Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel   |
| should live of the gospel.\                                           |
| 15 But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these |
| things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me  |
| to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.\              |
| 16 For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for    |
| necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the   |
| gospel!\                                                              |
| 17 For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against  |
| my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me.\          |
| 18 What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I   |
| may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my     |
| power in the gospel.\                                                 |
| 19 For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant  |
| unto all, that I might gain the more.\                                |
| 20 And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews;   |
| to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain   |
| them that are under the law;\                                         |
| 21 To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without   |
| law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that |
| are without law.\                                                     |
| 22 To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am     |
| made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.\     |
| 23 And this I do for the gospel\'s sake, that I might be partaker     |

| that we may enter into them.\                                         |
| 13 And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went  |
| out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a    |
| steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were    |
| choked in the sea.\                                                   |
| 14 And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in  |
| the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.\     |
| 15 And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the    |
| devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right     |
| mind: and they were afraid.\                                          |
| 16 And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was       |
| possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine.\             |
| 17 And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.\         |
| 18 And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed     |
| with the devil prayed him that he might be with him.\                 |
| 19 Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy |
| friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee,  |
| and hath had compassion on thee.\                                     |

| 23 Am I a God at hand, saith the LORD, and not a God afar off?\       |
| 24 Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him?    |
| saith the LORD. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the LORD.\      |
| 25 I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my      |
| name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.\                        |
| 26 How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy  |

| forgotten my name for Baal.\                                          |

| 5 Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also |
| hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.\                        |
| 6 Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at   |
| home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:\                       |
| []{#anchor334495}7 (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)\             |

| of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body,    |
| according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.\           |
| 11 Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we  |

| sober, it is for your cause.\                                         |
| 14 For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge,     |
| that if one died for all, then were all dead:\                        |
| []{#anchor338239}15 And that he died for all, that they which live    |

| for them, and rose again.\                                            |

| no more.\                                                             |
| 17 Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old       |
| things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.\           |
| 18 And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by    |
| Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;\   |
| 19 To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto         |
| himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed  |
| unto us the word of reconciliation.\                                  |

| 5 To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent    |
| unto you, both rising up early, and sending them, but ye have not     |

| from the king\'s house unto the house of the LORD, and sat down in    |
| the entry of the new gate of the LORD\'S house.\                      |
| 11 Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to    |
| all the people, saying, This man is worthy to die; for he hath        |
| prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.\       |
| 12 Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people,    |

| 1 And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you.\                |
| 2 If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give    |
| glory unto my name, saith the LORD of hosts, I will even send a curse |
| upon you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I have cursed them    |
| already, because ye do not lay it to heart.\                          |
| 3 Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces,  |
| even the dung of your solemn feasts; and one shall take you away with |
| it.\                                                                  |
| 4 And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that  |
| my covenant might be with Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.\             |
| 5 My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him  |
| for the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name.\  |
| []{#anchor385738}6 The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity    |
| was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and |
| did turn many away from iniquity.\                                    |
| 7 For the priest\'s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek  |
| the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.\  |
| []{#anchor387901}8 But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused |
| many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi,   |
| saith the LORD of hosts.\                                             |
| 9 Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the |
| people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial  |
| in the law.\                                                          |

| 35 And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in      |
| their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and        |
| healing every sickness and every disease among the people.\           |
| 36 But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on    |
| them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep       |
| having no shepherd.\                                                  |
| 37 Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous,  |
| but the labourers are few;\                                           |
| 38 Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth |
| labourers into his harvest.\                                          |
| 1 And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them  |
| power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all      |
| manner of sickness and all manner of disease.\                        |
| 2 Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon,   |
| who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of         |
| Zebedee, and John his brother;\                                       |
| 3 Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James    |
| the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;\      |
| 4 Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.\    |
| 5 These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not   |
| into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans     |
| enter ye not:\                                                        |
| 6 But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\            |
| 7 And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.\    |
| 8 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: |
| freely ye have received, freely give.\                                |
| 9 Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,\        |
| 10 Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor  |
| yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.\                   |
| 11 And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, inquire who in it |
| is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.\                        |
| 12 And when ye come into an house, salute it.\                        |
| 13 And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it |
| be not worthy, let your peace return to you.\                         |
| 14 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye  |
| depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.\   |
| 15 Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of  |
| Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.\       |

| temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in:       |
| behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts.\                      |
| 2 But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when   |
| he appeareth? for he is like a refiner\'s fire, and like fullers\'    |
| soap:\                                                                |
| 3 And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall  |
| purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they |
| may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.\                |
| 4 Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the |
| LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years.\                 |
| 5 And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift      |
| witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and        |
| against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling   |
| in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the  |
| stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts.\   |
| 6 For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not |

| 14 Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into  |
| the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.\  |
| 15 For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the    |
| feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we  |
| are, yet without sin.\                                                |
| 16 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may |
| obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.\                |
| 1 For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in   |
| things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices |
| for sins:\                                                            |
| 2 Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out   |
| of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.\    |
| 3 And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for       |
| himself, to offer for sins.\                                          |
| 4 And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called   |
| of God, as was Aaron.\                                                |
| 5 So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but |
| he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.\ |
| 6 As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after |
| the order of Melchisedec.\                                            |
| 7 Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and    |
| supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to  |
| save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;\                |
| []{#anchor402055}8 Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by  |
| the things which he suffered;\                                        |
| 9 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation   |
| unto all them that obey him;\                                         |
| 10 Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.\      |
