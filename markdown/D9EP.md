**Psalm 47. Omnes gentes, plaudite.**\
CLAP your hands together, all ye peoples: \* O sing unto God with the
voice of melody.\
2 For the LORD is high, and to be feared; \* he is the great King upon
all the earth.\
3 He shall subdue the peoples under us, \* and the nations under our
feet.\
4 He shall choose out an heritage for us, \* even the excellency of
Jacob, whom he loved.\
5 God is gone up with a merry noise, \* and the LORD with the sound of
the trump.\
6 O sing praises, sing praises unto our God; \* O sing praises, sing
praises unto our King.\
7 For God is the King of all the earth: \* sing ye praises with
understanding.\
8 God reigneth over the nations; \* God sitteth upon his holy seat.\
9 The princes of the peoples are joined unto the people of the God of
Abraham; \* for God, which is very high exalted, doth defend the earth,
as it were with a shield.\

**Psalm 48. Magnus Dominus.**\
GREAT is the LORD, and highly to be praised \* in the city of our God,
even upon his holy hill.\
2 The hill of Sion is a fair place, and the joy of the whole earth; \*
upon the north side lieth the city of the great King: God is well known
in her palaces as a sure refuge.\
3 For lo, the kings of the earth \* were gathered, and gone by
together.\
4 They marvelled to see such things; \* they were astonished, and
suddenly cast down.\
5 Fear came there upon them; and sorrow, \* as upon a woman in her
travail.\
6 Thou dost break the ships of the sea \* through the east-wind.\
7 Like as we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of
hosts, in the city of our God; \* God upholdeth the same for ever.\
8 We wait for thy loving-kindness, O God, \* in the midst of thy
temple.\
9 O God, according to thy Name, so is thy praise unto the world\'s end;
\* thy right hand is full of righteousness.\
10 Let the mount Sion rejoice, and the daughters of Judah be glad, \*
because of thy judgments.\
11 Walk about Sion, and go round about her; \* and tell the towers
thereof.\
12 Mark well her bulwarks, consider her palaces, \* that ye may tell
them that come after.\
13 For this God is our God for ever and ever: \* he shall be our guide
unto death.\

**Psalm 49. Audite haec, omnes.**\
O HEAR ye this, all ye people; \* ponder it with your ears, all ye that
dwell in the world;\
2 High and low, rich and poor, \* one with another.\
3 My mouth shall speak of wisdom, \* and my heart shall muse of
understanding.\
4 I will incline mine ear to the parable, \* and show my dark speech
upon the harp.\
5 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, \* when wickedness at my
heels compasseth me round about?\
6 There be some that put their trust in their goods, \* and boast
themselves in the multitude of their riches.\
7 But no man may deliver his brother, \* nor give a ransom unto God for
him,\
8 (For it cost more to redeem their souls, \* so that he must let that
alone for ever;)\
9 That he shall live alway, \* and not see the grave.\
10 For he seeth that wise men also die and perish together, \* as well
as the ignorant and foolish, and leave their riches for other.\
11 And yet they think that their houses shall continue for ever, and
that their dwelling-places shall endure from one generation to another;
\* and call the lands after their own names.\
12 Nevertheless, man being in honour abideth not, \* seeing he may be
compared unto the beasts that perish;\
13 This their way is very foolishness; \* yet their posterity praise
their saying.\
14 They lie in the grave like sheep; death is their shepherd; and the
righteous shall have dominion over them in the morning: \* their beauty
shall consume in the sepulchre, and have no abiding.\
15 But God hath delivered my soul from the power of the grave; \* for he
shall receive me.\
16 Be not thou afraid, though one be made rich, \* or if the glory of
his house be increased;\
17 For he shall carry nothing away with him when he dieth, \* neither
shall his pomp follow him.\
18 For while he lived, he counted himself an happy man; \* and so long
as thou doest well unto thyself, men will speak good of thee.\
19 He shall follow the generation of his fathers, \* and shall never see
light.\
20 Man that is in honour but hath no understanding \* is compared unto
the beasts that perish.
