| **Psalm 76. Notus in Judaea.**\                                       |
| IN Judah is God known; \* his Name is great in Israel.\               |
| 2 At Salem is his tabernacle, \* and his dwelling in Sion.\           |
| 3 There brake he the arrows of the bow, \* the shield, the sword, and |
| the battle.\                                                          |
| 4 Thou art glorious in might, \* when thou comest from the hills of   |
| the robbers.\                                                         |
| 5 The proud are robbed, they have slept their sleep; \* and all the   |
| men whose hands were mighty have found nothing.\                      |
| 6 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, \* both the chariot and horse are    |
| fallen.\                                                              |
| 7 Thou, even thou art to be feared; \* and who may stand in thy sight |
| when thou art angry?\                                                 |
| 8 Thou didst cause thy judgment to be heard from heaven; \* the earth |
| trembled, and was still,\                                             |
| 9 When God arose to judgment, \* and to help all the meek upon        |
| earth.\                                                               |
| 10 The fierceness of man shall turn to thy praise; \* and the         |
| fierceness of them shalt thou refrain.\                               |
| 11 Promise unto the LORD your God, and keep it, all ye that are round |
| about him; \* bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.\       |
| 12 He shall refrain the spirit of princes, \* and is wonderful among  |
| the kings of the earth.                                               |
