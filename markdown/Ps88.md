| **Psalm 88. Domine, Deus.**\                                          |
| O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee:   |
| \* O let my prayer enter into thy presence, incline thine ear unto my |
| calling;\                                                             |
| 2 For my soul is full of trouble, \* and my life draweth nigh unto    |
| the grave.\                                                           |
| 3 I am counted as one of them that go down into the pit, \* and I am  |
| even as a man that hath no strength;\                                 |
| 4 Cast off among the dead, like unto them that are slain, and lie in  |
| the grave, \* who are out of remembrance, and are cut away from thy   |
| hand.\                                                                |
| 5 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, \* in a place of darkness, and |
| in the deep.\                                                         |
| 6 Thine indignation lieth hard upon me, \* and thou hast vexed me     |
| with all thy storms.\                                                 |
| 7 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me, \* and made me to |
| be abhorred of them.\                                                 |
| 8 I am so fast in prison \* that I cannot get forth.\                 |
| 9 My sight faileth for very trouble; \* LORD, I have called daily     |
| upon thee, I have stretched forth my hands unto thee.\                |
| 10 Dost thou show wonders among the dead? \* or shall the dead rise   |
| up again, and praise thee?\                                           |
| 11 Shall thy loving-kindness be showed in the grave? \* or thy        |
| faithfulness in destruction?\                                         |
| 12 Shall thy wondrous works be known in the dark? \* and thy          |
| righteousness in the land where all things are forgotten?\            |
| 13 Unto thee have I cried, O LORD; \* and early shall my prayer come  |
| before thee.\                                                         |
| 14 LORD, why abhorrest thou my soul, \* and hidest thou thy face from |
| me?\                                                                  |
| 15 I am in misery, and like unto him that is at the point to die; \*  |
| even from my youth up, thy terrors have I suffered with a troubled    |
| mind.\                                                                |
| 16 Thy wrathful displeasure goeth over me, \* and the fear of thee    |
| hath undone me.\                                                      |
| 17 They came round about me daily like water, \* and compassed me     |
| together on every side.\                                              |
| 18 My lovers and friends hast thou put away from me, \* and hid mine  |
| acquaintance out of my sight.                                         |
