**Psalm 18. Diligam te, Domine.**\
I WILL love thee, O LORD, my strength. \* The LORD is my stony rock, and
my defence;\
2 My Saviour, my God, and my might, in whom I will trust; \* my buckler,
the horn also of my salvation, and my refuge.\
3 I will call upon the LORD, which is worthy to be praised; \* so shall
I be safe from mine enemies.\
4 The sorrows of death compassed me, \* and the overflowings of
ungodliness made me afraid.\
5 The pains of hell came about me; \* the snares of death overtook me.\
6 In my trouble I called upon the LORD, \* and complained unto my God:\
7 So he heard my voice out of his holy temple, \* and my complaint came
before him; it entered even into his ears.\
8 The earth trembled and quaked, \* the very foundations also of the
hills shook, and were removed, because he was wroth.\
9 There went a smoke out in his presence, \* and a consuming fire out of
his mouth, so that coals were kindled at it.\
10 He bowed the heavens also, and came down, \* and it was dark under
his feet.\
11 He rode upon the Cherubim, and did fly; \* he came flying upon the
wings of the wind.\
12 He made darkness his secret place, \* his pavilion round about him
with dark water, and thick clouds to cover him.\
13 At the brightness of his presence his clouds removed; \* hailstones
and coals of fire.\
14 The LORD also thundered out of heaven, and the Highest gave his
thunder; \* hailstones and coals of fire.\
15 He sent out his arrows, and scattered them; \* he cast forth
lightnings, and destroyed them.\
16 The springs of waters were seen, and the foundations of the round
world were discovered, \* at thy chiding, O LORD, at the blasting of the
breath of thy displeasure.\
17 He sent down from on high to fetch me, \* and took me out of many
waters.\
18 He delivered me from my strongest enemy, and from them which hate me;
\* for they were too mighty for me.\
19 They came upon me in the day of my trouble; \* but the LORD was my
upholder.\
20 He brought me forth also into a place of liberty; \* he brought me
forth, even because he had a favour unto me.\
21 The LORD rewarded me after my righteous dealing, \* according to the
cleanness of my hands did he recompense me.\
22 Because I have kept the ways of the LORD, \* and have not forsaken my
God, as the wicked doth.\
23 For I have an eye unto all his laws, \* and will not cast out his
commandments from me.\
24 I was also uncorrupt before him, \* and eschewed mine own
wickedness.\
25 Therefore the LORD rewarded me after my righteous dealing, \* and
according unto the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.\
26 With the holy thou shalt be holy, \* and with a perfect man thou
shalt be perfect.\
27 With the clean thou shalt be clean, \* and with the froward thou
shalt be froward.\
28 For thou shalt save the people that are in adversity, and shalt bring
down the high looks of the proud.\
29 Thou also shalt light my candle; \* the LORD my God shall make my
darkness to be light.\
30 For in thee I shall discomfit an host of men, \* and with the help of
my God I shall leap over the wall.\
31 The way of God is an undefiled way: \* the word of the LORD also is
tried in the fire; he is the defender of all them that put their trust
in him.\
32 For who is God, but the LORD? \* or who hath any strength, except our
God?\
33 It is God that girdeth me with strength of war, \* and maketh my way
perfect.\
34 He maketh my feet like harts\' feet, \* and setteth me up on high.\
35 He teacheth mine hands to fight, \* and mine arms shall bend even a
bow of steel.\
36 Thou hast given me the defence of thy salvation; \* thy right hand
also shall hold me up, and thy loving correction shall make me great.\
37 Thou shalt make room enough under me for to go, \* that my footsteps
shall not slide.\
38 I will follow upon mine enemies, and overtake them; \* neither will I
turn again till I have destroyed them.\
39 I will smite them, that they shall not be able to stand, \* but fall
under my feet.\
40 Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle; \* thou shalt
throw down mine enemies under me.\
41 Thou hast made mine enemies also to turn their backs upon me, \* and
I shall destroy them that hate me.\
42 They shall cry, but there shall be none to help them; \* yea, even
unto the LORD shall they cry, but he shall not hear them.\
43 I will beat them as small as the dust before the wind: \* I will cast
them out as the clay in the streets.\
44 Thou shalt deliver me from the strivings of the people, \* and thou
shalt make me the head of the nations; a people whom I have not known
shall serve me.\
45 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me; \* the strangers
shall feign obedience unto me.\
46 The strangers shall fail, \* and come trembling out of their
strongholds.\
47 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my strong helper, \* and praised be
the God of my salvation;\
48 Even the God that seeth that I be avenged, \* and subdueth the people
unto me.\
49 It is he that delivereth me from my cruel enemies, and setteth me up
above mine adversaries: \* thou shalt rid me from the wicked man.\
50 For this cause will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the
Gentiles, \* and sing praises unto thy Name.\
51 Great prosperity giveth he unto his King, \* and showeth
loving-kindness unto David his anointed, and unto his seed for evermore.
