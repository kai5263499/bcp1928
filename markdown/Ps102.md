| \                                                                     |
|                                                                       |
| **Psalm 102. Domine, exaudi.**\                                       |
| HEAR my prayer, O LORD, \* and let my crying come unto thee.\         |
| 2 Hide not thy face from me in the time of my trouble; \* incline     |
| thine ear unto me when I call; O hear me, and that right soon.\       |
| 3 For my days are consumed away like smoke, \* and my bones are burnt |
| up as it were a firebrand.\                                           |
| 4 My heart is smitten down, and withered like grass; \* so that I     |
| forget to eat my bread.\                                              |
| 5 For the voice of my groaning, \* my bones will scarce cleave to my  |
| flesh.\                                                               |
| 6 I am become like a pelican in the wilderness, \* and like an owl    |
| that is in the desert.\                                               |
| 7 I have watched, and am even as it were a sparrow, \* that sitteth   |
| alone upon the housetop.\                                             |
| 8 Mine enemies revile me all the day long; \* and they that are mad   |
| upon me are sworn together against me.\                               |
| 9 For I have eaten ashes as it were bread, \* and mingled my drink    |
| with weeping;\                                                        |
| 10 And that, because of thine indignation and wrath; \* for thou hast |
| taken me up, and cast me down.\                                       |
| 11 My days are gone like a shadow, \* and I am withered like grass.\  |
| 12 But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever, \* and thy remembrance    |
| throughout all generations.\                                          |
| 13 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Sion; \* for it is time that |
| thou have mercy upon her, yea, the time is come.\                     |
| 14 And why? thy servants think upon her stones, \* and it pitieth     |
| them to see her in the dust.\                                         |
| []{#anchor130066}15 The nations shall fear thy Name, O LORD; \* and   |
| all the kings of the earth thy majesty;\                              |
| 16 When the LORD shall build up Sion, \* and when his glory shall     |
| appear;\                                                              |
| 17 When he turneth him unto the prayer of the poor destitute, \* and  |
| despiseth not their desire.\                                          |
| 18 This shall be written for those that come after, \* and the people |
| which shall be born shall praise the LORD.\                           |
| 19 For he hath looked down from his sanctuary; \* out of the heaven   |
| did the LORD behold the earth;\                                       |
| 20 That he might hear the mournings of such as are in captivity, \*   |
| and deliver them that are appointed unto death;\                      |
| 21 That they may declare the Name of the LORD in Sion, \* and his     |
| worship at Jerusalem;\                                                |
| 22 When the peoples are gathered together, \* and the kingdoms also,  |
| to serve the LORD.\                                                   |
| 23 He brought down my strength in my journey, \* and shortened my     |
| days.\                                                                |
| 24 But I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of mine age;   |
| \* as for thy years, they endure throughout all generations.\         |
| 25 Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the       |
| earth, \* and the heavens are the work of thy hands.\                 |
| 26 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: \* they all shall wax    |
| old as doth a garment;\                                               |
| 27 And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be         |
| changed; \* but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.\     |
| 28 The children of thy servants shall continue, \* and their seed     |
| shall stand fast in thy sight.                                        |
