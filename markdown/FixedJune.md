| 1 Brethren, my heart\'s desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that  |
| they might be saved.\                                                 |
| 2 For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not        |
| according to knowledge.\                                              |
| 3 For they being ignorant of God\'s righteousness, and going about to |
| establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto |
| the righteousness of God.\                                            |
| 4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one     |
| that believeth.\                                                      |
| 5 For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That    |
| the man which doeth those things shall live by them.\                 |
| 6 But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say  |
| not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring  |
| Christ down from above:)\                                             |
| 7 Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ   |
| again from the dead.)\                                                |
| 8 But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in |
| thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;\              |
| 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt |
| believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou   |
| shalt be saved.\                                                      |
| 10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the  |
| mouth confession is made unto salvation.\                             |
| 11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be   |
| ashamed.\                                                             |
| 12 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the  |
| same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.\              |
| 13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be        |
| saved.\                                                               |
| 14 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?    |
| and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and    |
| how shall they hear without a preacher?\                              |
| 15 And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written,  |
| How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace,   |
| and bring glad tidings of good things!\                               |

| girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.\     |

| 7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his     |
| baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned   |
| you to flee from the wrath to come?\                                  |
| 8 Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:\                  |

| father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise |
| up children unto Abraham.\                                            |

| into the fire.\                                                       |

| cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to    |
| bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:\       |

| and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff   |

| 1 Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of  |
| prayer, being the ninth hour.\                                        |
| 2 And a certain man lame from his mother\'s womb was carried, whom    |
| they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful,  |
| to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;\                    |
| 3 Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an      |
| alms.\                                                                |
| 4 And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on     |
| us.\                                                                  |
| 5 And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of       |
| them.\                                                                |
| 6 Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have    |
| give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and      |
| walk.\                                                                |
| 7 And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and           |
| immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.\              |
| 8 And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the |
| temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.\                      |
| 9 And all the people saw him walking and praising God:\               |
| 10 And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful   |
| gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at |
| that which had happened unto him.\                                    |
| 11 And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the  |
| people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon\'s, |
| greatly wondering.\                                                   |
| 12 And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of      |
| Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as  |
| though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?\    |
| 13 The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our     |
| fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and      |
| denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let   |
| him go.\                                                              |
| 14 But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to |
| be granted unto you;\                                                 |
| 15 And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; |
| whereof we are witnesses.\                                            |
| 16 And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong,  |
| whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him   |
| this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.\                   |
| 17 And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did  |
| also your rulers.\                                                    |
| 18 But those things, which God before had shown by the mouth of all   |
| his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.\       |
| 19 Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be       |
| blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the         |
| presence of the Lord;\                                                |
| 20 And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto     |
| you:\                                                                 |
| 21 Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all |
| things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets   |
| since the world began.\                                               |
| 22 For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord    |
| your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall  |
| ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.\              |
| 23 And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear    |
| that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.\              |
| 24 Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, |
| as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.\        |
| 25 Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God |
| made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all |
| the kindreds of the earth be blessed.\                                |
| 26 Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to    |
| bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.\     |

| 14 I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of |
| Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold, and  |
| in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.\       |
| 15 I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the |
| Lord GOD.\                                                            |

| 15 So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of  |
| Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord;  |
| thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.\     |
| 16 He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest |
| thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. |
| He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.\                                    |

| me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest |
| thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou    |
| knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.\       |
| 18 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou        |

| shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall   |
| gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.\                 |
