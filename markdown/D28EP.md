**Psalm 137. Super flumina.**\
BY the waters of Babylon we sat down and wept, \* when we remembered
thee, O Sion.\
2 As for our harps, we hanged them up \* upon the trees that are
therein.\
3 For they that led us away captive, required of us then a song, and
melody in our heaviness: \* Sing us one of the songs of Sion.\
4 How shall we sing the LORD\'S song \* in a strange land?\
5 If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, \* let my right hand forget her
cunning.\
6 If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my
mouth; \* yea, if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.\
7 Remember the children of Edom, O LORD, in the day of Jerusalem; \* how
they said, Down with it, down with it, even to the ground.\
8 O daughter of Babylon, wasted with misery; \* yea, happy shall he be
that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.\
9 Blessed shall he be that taketh thy children, \* and throweth them
against the stones.\

**Psalm 138. Confitebor tibi.**\
I WILL give thanks unto thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; \* even
before the gods will I sing praise unto thee.\
2 I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy Name, because of
thy loving-kindness and truth; \* for thou hast magnified thy Name, and
thy word, above all things.\
3 When I called upon thee, thou heardest me; \* and enduedst my soul
with much strength.\
4 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD; \* for they have
heard the words of thy mouth.\
5 Yea, they shall sing of the ways of the LORD, \* that great is the
glory of the LORD.\
6 For though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly; \* as
for the proud, he beholdeth them afar off.\
7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, yet shalt thou refresh me; \*
thou shalt stretch forth thy hand upon the furiousness of mine enemies,
and thy right hand shall save me.\
8 The LORD shall make good his loving-kindness toward me; \* yea, thy
mercy, O LORD, endureth for ever; despise not then the works of thine
own hands.
