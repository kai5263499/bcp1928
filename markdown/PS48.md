| **Psalms 48. Magnus Dominus.**\                                       |
| GREAT is the LORD, and highly to be praised \* in the city of our     |
| God, even upon his holy hill.\                                        |
| 2 The hill of Sion is a fair place, and the joy of the whole earth;   |
| \* upon the north side lieth the city of the great King: God is well  |
| known in her palaces as a sure refuge.\                               |
| 3 For lo, the kings of the earth \* were gathered, and gone by        |
| together.\                                                            |
| 4 They marvelled to see such things; \* they were astonished, and     |
| suddenly cast down.\                                                  |
| 5 Fear came there upon them; and sorrow, \* as upon a woman in her    |
| travail.\                                                             |
| 6 Thou dost break the ships of the sea \* through the east-wind.\     |
| 7 Like as we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of   |
| hosts, in the city of our God; \* God upholdeth the same for ever.\   |
| 8 We wait for thy loving-kindness, O God, \* in the midst of thy      |
| temple.\                                                              |
| 9 O God, according to thy Name, so is thy praise unto the world\'s    |
| end; \* thy right hand is full of righteousness.\                     |
| 10 Let the mount Sion rejoice, and the daughters of Judah be glad, \* |
| because of thy judgments.\                                            |
| 11 Walk about Sion, and go round about her; \* and tell the towers    |
| thereof.\                                                             |
| 12 Mark well her bulwarks, consider her palaces, \* that ye may tell  |
| them that come after.\                                                |
| 13 For this God is our God for ever and ever: \* he shall be our      |
| guide unto death.                                                     |
