| **Psalm 115. Non nobis, Domine.**\                                    |
| NOT unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy Name give the praise;  |
| \* for thy loving mercy, and for thy truth\'s sake.\                  |
| 2 Wherefore shall the heathen say, \* Where is now their God?\        |
| 3 As for our God, he is in heaven: \* he hath done whatsoever pleased |
| him.\                                                                 |
| 4 Their idols are silver and gold, \* even the work of men\'s hands.\ |
| 5 They have mouths, and speak not; \* eyes have they, and see not.\   |
| 6 They have ears, and hear not; \* noses have they, and smell not.\   |
| 7 They have hands, and handle not; feet have they, and walk not; \*   |
| neither speak they through their throat.\                             |
| 8 They that make them are like unto them; \* and so are all such as   |
| put their trust in them.\                                             |
| 9 But thou, house of Israel, trust thou in the LORD; \* he is their   |
| helper and defender.\                                                 |
| 10 Ye house of Aaron, put your trust in the LORD; \* he is their      |
| helper and defender.\                                                 |
| 11 Ye that fear the LORD, put your trust in the LORD; \* he is their  |
| helper and defender.\                                                 |
| 12 The LORD hath been mindful of us, and he shall bless us; \* even   |
| he shall bless the house of Israel, he shall bless the house of       |
| Aaron.\                                                               |
| 13 He shall bless them that fear the LORD, \* both small and great.\  |
| 14 The LORD shall increase you more and more, \* you and your         |
| children.\                                                            |
| 15 Ye are the blessed of the LORD, \* who made heaven and earth.\     |
| 16 All the whole heavens are the LORD\'S; \* the earth hath he given  |
| to the children of men.\                                              |
| 17 The dead praise not thee, O LORD, \* neither all they that go down |
| into silence.\                                                        |
| 18 But we will praise the LORD, \* from this time forth for evermore. |
| Praise the LORD.                                                      |
