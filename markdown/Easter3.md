| 15 And the LORD struck the child that Uriah\'s wife bare unto David,  |
| and it was very sick.\                                                |
| 16 David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and  |
| went in, and lay all night upon the earth.\                           |
| 17 And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him   |
| up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with    |
| them.\                                                                |
| 18 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And   |
| the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for |
| they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him,  |
| and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex         |
| himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?\                      |
| 19 But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived    |
| that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is   |
| the child dead? And they said, He is dead.\                           |
| 20 Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, |
| and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and     |
| worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they |
| set bread before him, and he did eat.\                                |
| 21 Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast |
| done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but |
| when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.\              |
| []{#anchor1858686}22 And he said, While the child was yet alive, I    |
| fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be         |
| gracious to me, that the child may live?\                             |
| 23 But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back  |
| again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.\             |

| **[]{#anchor948295}1 For we know that if our earthly house of this    |
| tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not    |
| made with hands, eternal in the heavens.\                             |
| 2 For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with    |
| our house which is from heaven:\                                      |
| 3 If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.\           |
| 4 For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not    |
| for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality      |
| might be swallowed up of life.\                                       |
| 5 Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also |
| hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.\                        |
| 6 Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at   |
| home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:\                       |
| []{#anchor1866341}7 (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)\            |
| 8 We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the   |
| body, and to be present with the Lord.\                               |
| 9 Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be     |
| accepted of him.\                                                     |
| 10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that    |
| every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that  |
| he hath done, whether it be good or bad.\                             |
| 11 Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we  |
| are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in     |
| your consciences.\                                                    |
| 12 For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion |
| to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them      |
| which glory in appearance, and not in heart.\                         |
| 13 For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be |
| sober, it is for your cause.\                                         |
| []{#anchor1867191}14 For the love of Christ constraineth us; because  |
| we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:\         |
| 15 And that he died for all, that they which live should not          |
| henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them,    |
| and rose again.\                                                      |
| 16 Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though   |
| we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him  |
| no more.\                                                             |
| 17 Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old       |
| things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.\           |
| 18 And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by    |
| Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;\   |
| 19 To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto         |
| himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed  |
| unto us the word of reconciliation.\                                  |
| []{#anchor1868292}20 Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as       |

| Hebrews 9:15-28\                                                      |
| **[]{#anchor965880}15 And for this cause he is the mediator of the    |
| new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the      |
| transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are    |
| called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.\             |
| 16 For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the      |
| death of the testator.\                                               |
| 17 For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of |
| no strength at all while the testator liveth.\                        |
| 18 Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without        |
| blood.\                                                               |
| 19 For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people          |
| according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with  |
| water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and |
| all the people,\                                                      |
| 20 Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined |
| unto you.\                                                            |
| 21 Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the  |
| vessels of the ministry.\                                             |
| 22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and        |
| without shedding of blood is no remission.\                           |
| 23 It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the      |
| heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things        |
| themselves with better sacrifices than these.\                        |
| 24 For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands,    |
| which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to     |
| appear in the presence of God for us:\                                |
| 25 Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest     |
| entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;\        |
| 26 For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the   |
| world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put   |
| away sin by the sacrifice of himself.\                                |
| 27 And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the    |
| judgment:\                                                            |
| 28 So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them |
| that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto    |
| salvation.\                                                           |

| of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both    |

| 16 And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the       |

| he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses\' anger waxed hot, and he |

| he made mention of my name.\                                          |

| Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;\                             |

| 7 And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp,     |
| afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the           |
| congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the    |
| LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was      |
| without the camp.\                                                    |
| 8 And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that  |
| all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and     |
| looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.\           |
| 9 And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the      |
| cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and |
| the LORD talked with Moses.\                                          |
| 10 And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle   |
| door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his     |
| tent door.\                                                           |

| his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant        |
| Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the          |
| tabernacle.\                                                          |

| this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with   |
| me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found |
| grace in my sight.\                                                   |
| 13 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight,    |
| show me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in   |
| thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.\              |
| 14 And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee  |
| rest.\                                                                |

| found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so    |
| shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are |
| upon the face of the earth.\                                          |

| will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious  |

| mercy.\                                                               |

| of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which   |
| do appear.\                                                           |
| 4 By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than      |
| Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God         |
| testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.\       |
| 5 By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was |
| not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation |
| he had this testimony, that he pleased God.\                          |
| 6 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that       |
| cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of   |
| them that diligently seek him.\                                       |
| 7 By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved |
| with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which   |
| he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is |
| by faith.\                                                            |

| not knowing whither he went.\                                         |
| 9 By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange       |
| country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with |
| him of the same promise:\                                             |
| 10 For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and |
| maker is God.\                                                        |
| 11 Through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive     |
| seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she |
| judged him faithful who had promised.\                                |
| 12 Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so    |
| many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is   |
| by the sea shore innumerable.\                                        |
| 13 These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but     |
| having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced   |
| them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the      |
| earth.\                                                               |

| country.\                                                             |
| 15 And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence    |
| they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.\     |
| 16 But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly:        |
| wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath      |
