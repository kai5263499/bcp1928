**Psalm 30. Exaltabo te, Domine.**\
I WILL magnify thee, O LORD; for thou hast set me up, \* and not made my
foes to triumph over me.\
2 O LORD my God, I cried unto thee; \* and thou hast healed me.\
3 Thou, LORD, hast brought my soul out of hell: \* thou hast kept my
life, that I should not go down into the pit.\
4 Sing praises unto the LORD, O ye saints of his; \* and give thanks
unto him, for a remembrance of his holiness.\
5 For his wrath endureth but the twinkling of an eye, and in his
pleasure is life; \* heaviness may endure for a night, but joy cometh in
the morning.\
6 And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be removed: \* thou, LORD,
of thy goodness, hast made my hill so strong.\
7 Thou didst turn thy face from me, \* and I was troubled.\
8 Then cried I unto thee, O LORD; \* and gat me to my LORD right
humbly.\
9 What profit is there in my blood, \* when I go down into the pit?\
10 Shall the dust give thanks unto thee? \* or shall it declare thy
truth?\
11 Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me; \* LORD, be thou my helper.\
12 Thou hast turned my heaviness into joy; \* thou hast put off my
sackcloth, and girded me with gladness:\
13 Therefore shall every good man sing of thy praise without ceasing. \*
O my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.\

**Psalm 31. In te, Domine, speravi.**\
IN thee, O LORD, have I put my trust; let me never be put to confusion;
\* deliver me in thy righteousness.\
2 Bow down thine ear to me; \* make haste to deliver me.\
3 And be thou my strong rock, and house of defence, \* that thou mayest
save me.\
4 For thou art my strong rock, and my castle: \* be thou also my guide,
and lead me for thy Name\'s sake.\
5 Draw me out of the net that they have laid privily for me; \* for thou
art my strength.\
6 Into thy hands I commend my spirit; \* for thou hast redeemed me, O
LORD, thou God of truth.\
7 I have hated them that hold of lying vanities, \* and my trust hath
been in the LORD.\
8 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy; \* for thou hast considered
my trouble, and hast known my soul in adversities.\
9 Thou hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy; \* but hast set
my feet in a large room.\
10 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble, \* and mine eye is
consumed for very heaviness; yea, my soul and my body.\
11 For my life is waxen old with heaviness, \* and my years with
mourning.\
12 My strength faileth me, because of mine iniquity, \* and my bones are
consumed.\
13 I became a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my
neighbours; \* and they of mine acquaintance were afraid of me; and they
that did see me without, conveyed themselves from me.\
14 I am clean forgotten as a dead man out of mind; \* I am become like a
broken vessel.\
15 For I have heard the blasphemy of the multitude, and fear is on every
side; \* while they conspire together against me, and take their counsel
to take away my life.\
16 But my hope hath been in thee, O LORD; \* I have said, Thou art my
God.\
17 My times are in thy hand; deliver me from the hand of mine enemies,
\* and from them that persecute me.\
18 Show thy servant the light of thy countenance, \* and save me for thy
mercy\'s sake.\
19 Let me not be confounded, O LORD, for I have called upon thee; \* let
the ungodly be put to confusion, and be put to silence in the grave.\
20 Let the lying lips be put to silence, \* which cruelly, disdainfully,
and despitefully speak against the righteous.\
21 O how plentiful is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them
that fear thee, \* and that thou hast prepared for them that put their
trust in thee, even before the sons of men!\
22 Thou shalt hide them in the covert of thine own presence from the
plottings of men: \* thou shalt keep them secretly in thy tabernacle
from the strife of tongues.\
23 Thanks be to the LORD; \* for he hath showed me marvellous great
kindness in a strong city.\
24 But in my haste I said, \* I am cast out of the sight of thine eyes.\
25 Nevertheless, thou heardest the voice of my prayer, \* when I cried
unto thee.\
26 O love the LORD, all ye his saints; \* for the LORD preserveth them
that are faithful, and plenteously rewardeth the proud doer.\
27 Be strong, and he shall establish your heart, \* all ye that put your
trust in the LORD.
