| ALMIGHTY and everliving God, we humbly beseech thy Majesty, that, as  |
| thy only-begotten Son was this day presented in the temple in         |
| substance of our flesh, so we may be presented unto thee with pure    |
| and clean hearts, by the same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\   |
|                                                                       |
| For the Epistle. Malachi iii. 1.                                      |
|                                                                       |
| BEHOLD, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before |
| me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple,    |
| even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he    |
| shall come, saith the LORD of hosts. But who may abide the day of his |
| coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a       |
| refiner\'s fire, and like fullers\' sope: and he shall sit as a       |
| refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, |
| and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the LORD  |
| an offering in righteousness. Then shall the offering of Judah and    |
| Jerusalem be pleasant unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in |
| former years. And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be  |
| a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers,    |
| and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the        |
| hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn   |
| aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the LORD of |
| hosts.\                                                               |
|                                                                       |
| The Gospel. St. Luke ii. 22.                                          |
|                                                                       |
| AND when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses   |
| were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to   |
| the Lord; (as it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that   |
| openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;) and to offer a    |
| sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A   |
| pair of turtle-doves, or two young pigeons. And, behold, there was a  |
| man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just    |
| and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost |
| was upon him. And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he |
| should not see death, before he had seen the Lord\'s Christ. And he   |
| came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in   |
| the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law, then took |
| he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said, Lord, now lettest   |
| thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word: for mine     |
| eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou hast prepared before the     |
| face of all people; a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of |
| thy people Israel. And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those       |
| things which were spoken of him. And Simeon blessed them, and said    |
| unto Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and      |
| rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken  |
| against; (yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that  |
| the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed. And there was one Anna,  |
| a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was  |
| of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her    |
| virginity; and she was a widow of about fourscore and four years,     |
| which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and  |
| prayers night and day. And she coming in that instant gave thanks     |
| likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for  |
| redemption in Jerusalem. And when they had performed all things       |
| according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to      |
| their own city Nazareth. And the child grew, and waxed strong in      |
| spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.        |
|                                                                       |
