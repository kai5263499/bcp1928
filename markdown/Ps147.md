| **Psalm 147. Laudate Dominum.**\                                      |
| PRAISE the LORD, for it is a good thing to sing praises unto our God; |
| \* yea, a joyful and pleasant thing it is to be thankful.\            |
| 2 The LORD doth build up Jerusalem, \* and gather together the        |
| outcasts of Israel.\                                                  |
| 3 He healeth those that are broken in heart, \* and giveth medicine   |
| to heal their sickness.\                                              |
| 4 He telleth the number of the stars, \* and calleth them all by      |
| their names.\                                                         |
| 5 Great is our Lord, and great is his power; \* yea, and his wisdom   |
| is infinite.\                                                         |
| 6 The LORD setteth up the meek, \* and bringeth the ungodly down to   |
| the ground.\                                                          |
| 7 O sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; \* sing praises upon the    |
| harp unto our God:\                                                   |
| 8 Who covereth the heaven with clouds, and prepareth rain for the     |
| earth; \* and maketh the grass to grow upon the mountains, and herb   |
| for the use of men;\                                                  |
| 9 Who giveth fodder unto the cattle, \* and feedeth the young ravens  |
| that call upon him.\                                                  |
| 10 He hath no pleasure in the strength of an horse; \* neither        |
| delighteth he in any man\'s legs.\                                    |
| 11 But the LORD\'S delight is in them that fear him, \* and put their |
| trust in his mercy. \~\                                               |
| 12 Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; \* praise thy God, O Sion.\          |
| 13 For he hath made fast the bars of thy gates, \* and hath blessed   |
| thy children within thee.\                                            |
| 14 He maketh peace in thy borders, \* and filleth thee with the flour |
| of wheat.\                                                            |
| 15 He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth, \* and his word       |
| runneth very swiftly.\                                                |
| 16 He giveth snow like wool, \* and scattereth the hoarfrost like     |
| ashes.\                                                               |
| 17 He casteth forth his ice like morsels: \* who is able to abide his |
| frost?\                                                               |
| 18 He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: \* he bloweth with his  |
| wind, and the waters flow.\                                           |
| 19 He showeth his word unto Jacob, \* his statutes and ordinances     |
| unto Israel.\                                                         |
| 20 He hath not dealt so with any nation; \* neither have the heathen  |
| knowledge of his laws.                                                |
