| **Psalm 51. Miserere mei, Deus.**\                                    |
| HAVE mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness; \* according to  |
| the multitude of thy mercies do away mine offences.\                  |
| 2 Wash me throughly from my wickedness, \* and cleanse me from my     |
| sin.\                                                                 |
| 3 For I acknowledge my faults, \* and my sin is ever before me.\      |
| 4 Against thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight;   |
| \* that thou mightest be justified in thy saying, and clear when thou |
| shalt judge.\                                                         |
| 5 Behold, I was shapen in wickedness, \* and in sin hath my mother    |
| conceived me.\                                                        |
| 6 But lo, thou requirest truth in the inward parts, \* and shalt make |
| me to understand wisdom secretly.\                                    |
| 7 Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; \* thou      |
| shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.\                      |
| 8 Thou shalt make me hear of joy and gladness, \* that the bones      |
| which thou hast broken may rejoice.\                                  |
| 9 Turn thy face from my sins, \* and put out all my misdeeds.\        |
| 10 Make me a clean heart, O God, \* and renew a right spirit within   |
| me.\                                                                  |
| 11 Cast me not away from thy presence, \* and take not thy holy       |
| Spirit from me.\                                                      |
| 12 O give me the comfort of thy help again, \* and stablish me with   |
| thy free Spirit.\                                                     |
| 13 Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked, \* and sinners shall  |
| be converted unto thee.\                                              |
| 14 Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou that art the God of  |
| my health; \* and my tongue shall sing of thy righteousness.\         |
| 15 Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord, \* and my mouth shall show thy    |
| praise.\                                                              |
| 16 For thou desirest no sacrifice, else would I give it thee; \* but  |
| thou delightest not in burnt-offerings.\                              |
| 17 The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit: \* a broken and         |
| contrite heart, O God, shalt thou not despise.\                       |
| 18 O be favourable and gracious unto Sion; \* build thou the walls of |
| Jerusalem.\                                                           |
| 19 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness,    |
| with the burnt-offerings and oblations; \* then shall they offer      |
| young bullocks upon thine altar.                                      |
