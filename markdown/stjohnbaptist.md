| ALMIGHTY God, by whose providence thy servant John Baptist was        |
| wonderfully born, and sent to prepare the way of thy Son our Saviour  |
| by preaching repentance; Make us so to follow his doctrine and holy   |
| life, that we may truly repent according to his preaching; and after  |
| his example constantly speak the truth, boldly rebuke vice, and       |
| patiently suffer for the truth\'s sake; through the same thy Son      |
| Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\                                         |
|                                                                       |
| For the Epistle. Isaiah xl. 1.                                        |
|                                                                       |
| COMFORT ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. Speak ye            |
| comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is       |
| accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of |
| the LORD\'S hand double for all her sins. The voice of him that       |
| crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the LORD, make        |
| straight in the desert a highway for our God. Every valley shall be   |
| exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the       |
| crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain: and the   |
| glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it       |
| together: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it. The voice said,   |
| Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the   |
| goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field: the grass           |
| withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the LORD bloweth  |
| upon it: surely the people is grass. The grass withereth, the flower  |
| fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever. O Zion, that    |
| bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O          |
| Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with         |
| strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah,    |
| Behold your God! Behold, the Lord GOD will come with strong hand, and |
| his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his   |
| work before him. He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall    |
| gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall |
| gently lead those that are with young.\                               |

| The Gospel. St. Luke i. 57.                                           |
|                                                                       |
| ELISABETH\'S full time came that she should be delivered; and she     |
| brought forth a son. And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the |
| Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her. And |
| it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the   |
| child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.   |
| And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called      |
| John. And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is    |
| called by this name. And they made signs to his father, how he would  |
| have him called. And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, |
| His name is John. And they marvelled all. And his mouth was opened    |
| immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, and praised God.    |
| And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these       |
| sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea. |
| And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying,    |
| What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with |
| him. And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and     |
| prophesied, saying, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath    |
| visited and redeemed his people, and hath raised up an horn of        |
| salvation for us in the house of his servant David; as he spake by    |
| the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world       |
| began: that we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of |
| all that hate us; to perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and   |
| to remember his holy covenant; the oath which he sware to our father  |
| Abraham, that he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of  |
| the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear, in holiness and |
| righteousness before him, all the days of our life. And thou, child,  |
| shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before  |
| the face of the Lord to prepare his ways; to give knowledge of        |
| salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins, through the |
| tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath      |
| visited us, to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the     |
| shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace. And the     |
| child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till   |
| the day of his shewing unto Israel.                                   |
