| **The Apostles\' Creed.**\                                            |
| I Believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth:\     |
| And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord: Who was conceived by the   |
| Holy Ghost, Born of the Virgin Mary: Suffered under Pontius Pilate,   |
| Was crucified, dead, and buried: He descended into hell; The third    |
| day he rose again from the dead: He ascended into heaven, And sitteth |
| on the right hand of God the Father Almighty: From thence he shall    |
| come to judge the quick and the dead.\                                |
| I believe in the Holy Ghost: The holy Catholic Church; The Communion  |
| of Saints: The Forgiveness of sins: The Resurrection of the body: And |
| the Life everlasting. Amen.\                                          |

| **The Lord\'s Prayer.**\                                              |
| Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom      |
| come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day |
| our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive those   |
| who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, But deliver |
| us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, |
| for ever and ever. Amen.\                                             |

| **A Collect for Aid against Perils.**\                                |
| Lighten our darkness, we beseech thee, O Lord; and by thy great mercy |
| defend us from all perils and dangers of this night; for the love of  |
| thy only Son, our Saviour, Jesus Christ. Amen.                        |
|                                                                       |
| **A Prayer for all Conditions of Men.**\                              |
| O God, the Creator and Preserver of all mankind, we humbly beseech    |
| thee for all sorts and conditions of men; that thou wouldest be       |
| pleased to make thy ways known unto them, thy saving health unto all  |
| nations. More especially we pray for thy holy Church universal; that  |
| it may be so guided and governed by thy good Spirit, that all who     |
| profess and call themselves Christians may be led into the way of     |
| truth, and hold the faith in unity of spirit, in the bond of peace,   |
| and in righteousness of life. Finally, we commend to thy fatherly     |
| goodness all those who are any ways afflicted, or distressed, in      |
| mind, body, or estate; that it may please thee to comfort and relieve |
| them, according to their several necessities; giving them patience    |
| under their sufferings, and a happy issue out of all their            |
| afflictions. And this we beg for Jesus Christ\'s sake. Amen.\         |
| \                                                                     |
| **2 Cor. xiii. 14.**\                                                 |
| The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the      |
| fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. Amen.          |
|                                                                       |
