| ALMIGHTY and everliving God, who, for the greater confirmation of the |
| faith, didst suffer thy holy Apostle Thomas to be doubtful in thy     |
| Son\'s resurrection; Grant us so perfectly, and without all doubt, to |
| believe in thy Son Jesus Christ, that our faith in thy sight may      |
| never be reproved. Hear us, O Lord, through the same Jesus Christ, to |
| whom, with thee and the Holy Ghost, be all honour and glory, now and  |
| for evermore. Amen.\                                                  |

| CAST not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence  |
| of reward. For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the |
| will of God, ye might receive the promise. For yet a little while,    |
| and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry. Now the just    |
| shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no  |
| pleasure in him. But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; |
| but of them that believe to the saving of the soul. Now faith is the  |
| substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\      |

| THOMAS, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when     |
| Jesus came. The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen |
| the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the  |
| print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails,    |
| and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe. And after eight |
| days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came |
| Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace  |
| be unto you. Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and    |
| behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my     |
| side: and be not faithless, but believing. And Thomas answered and    |
| said unto him, My Lord and my God. Jesus saith unto him, Thomas,      |
| because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that  |
| have not seen, and yet have believed. And many other signs truly did  |
| Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this |
| book: but these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the  |
| Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through |
| his name.                                                             |
