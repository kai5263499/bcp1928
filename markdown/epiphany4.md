| **[]{#anchor195008}1 The spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because   |
| the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he    |
| hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the |
| captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;\      |
| 2 To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of         |
| vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;\                     |
| 3 To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty   |
| for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the |
| spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of               |
| righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.\ |
| 4 And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former |
| desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations  |
| of many generations.\                                                 |
| 5 And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the |
| alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.\                   |
| 6 But ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD: men shall call you   |
| the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles,    |
| and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.\                        |
| 7 For your shame ye shall have double; and for confusion they shall   |
| rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess  |
| the double: everlasting joy shall be unto them.\                      |
| 8 For I the LORD love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt offering;    |
| and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting |
| covenant with them.\                                                  |
| 9 And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their         |
| offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them, |
| that they are the seed which the LORD hath blessed.\                  |
| 10 I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my  |
| God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath   |
| covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh    |
| himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her      |
| jewels.\                                                              |
| 11 For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth |
| the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will  |
| cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the         |
| nations.\                                                             |

| 16 And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his |
| custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood  |
| up for to read.\                                                      |
| 17 And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias.   |
| And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was      |

| 18 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to  |
| preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the            |
| brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering  |
| of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,\      |
| 19 To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.\                        |

| fulfilled in your ears.\                                              |

| Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum,  |
| do also here in thy country.\                                         |

| Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years  |
| and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land;\       |
| 26 But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a city of |
| Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow.\                                |
| 27 And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; |
| and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian.\             |
| 28 And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were  |
| filled with wrath,\                                                   |

| Romans 10**\                                                          |
| 1 Brethren, my heart\'s desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that  |
| they might be saved.\                                                 |
| 2 For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not        |
| according to knowledge.\                                              |
| []{#anchor308257}3 For they being ignorant of God\'s righteousness,   |
| and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not        |
| submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.\                  |
| 4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one     |
| that believeth.\                                                      |
| 5 For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That    |
| the man which doeth those things shall live by them.\                 |
| 6 But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say  |
| not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring  |
| Christ down from above:)\                                             |
| 7 Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ   |
| again from the dead.)\                                                |
| 8 But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in |
| thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;\              |
| 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt |
| believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou   |
| shalt be saved.\                                                      |
| 10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the  |
| mouth confession is made unto salvation.\                             |
| 11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be   |
| ashamed.\                                                             |
| 12 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the  |
| same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.\              |
| []{#anchor316658}13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the     |
| Lord shall be saved.\                                                 |
| 14 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?    |
| and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and    |
| how shall they hear without a preacher?\                              |
| 15 And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written,  |
| How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace,   |
| and bring glad tidings of good things!\                               |
| 16 But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord,   |
| who hath believed our report?\                                        |
| 17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.\  |
| 18 But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into  |
| all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.\           |
| 19 But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke  |
| you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I |
| will anger you.\                                                      |
| 20 But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that       |
| sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after     |
| me.\                                                                  |
| 21 But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my     |
| hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.\                      |
