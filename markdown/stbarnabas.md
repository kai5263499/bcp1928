| O LORD God Almighty, who didst endue thy holy Apostle Barnabas with   |
| singular gifts of the Holy Ghost; Leave us not, we beseech thee,      |
| destitute of thy manifold gifts, nor yet of grace to use them alway   |
| to thy honour and glory; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\        |
|                                                                       |
| For the Epistle. Acts xi. 22.                                         |
|                                                                       |
| TIDINGS of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in |
| Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as  |
| Antioch. Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad,  |
| and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave   |
| unto the Lord. For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and  |
| of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord. Then departed      |
| Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul: and when he had found him, he   |
| brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they |
| assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the |
| disciples were called Christians first in Antioch. And in these days  |
| came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch. And there stood up one of  |
| them named Agabus, and signified by the spirit that there should be   |
| great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days |
| of Claudius Caesar. Then the disciples, every man according to his    |
| ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in   |
| Judaea: which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands   |
| of Barnabas and Saul.\                                                |

| The Gospel. St. John xv. 12.                                          |
|                                                                       |
| THIS is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved     |
| you. Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life |
| for his friends. Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command     |
| you. Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not  |
| what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things    |
| that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you. Ye have    |
| not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye       |
| should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain:   |
| that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it |
| you.                                                                  |
