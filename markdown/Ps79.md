| **Psalm 79. Deus, venerunt.**\                                        |
| O GOD, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; \* thy holy       |
| temple have they defiled, and made Jerusalem an heap of stones.\      |
| 2 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the |
| fowls of the air, \* and the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of   |
| the land.\                                                            |
| 3 Their blood have they shed like water on every side of Jerusalem,   |
| \* and there was no man to bury them.\                                |
| 4 We are become an open shame to our enemies, \* a very scorn and     |
| derision unto them that are round about us.\                          |
| 5 LORD, how long wilt thou be angry? \* shall thy jealousy burn like  |
| fire for ever?\                                                       |
| 6 Pour out thine indignation upon the heathen that have not known     |
| thee; \* and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy Name.\   |
| 7 For they have devoured Jacob, \* and laid waste his                 |
| dwelling-place.\                                                      |
| 8 O remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and that soon; |
| \* for we are come to great misery.\                                  |
| 9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name: \* O    |
| deliver us, and be merciful unto our sins, for thy Name\'s sake.\     |
| 10 Wherefore do the heathen say, \* Where is now their God?\          |
| 11 O let the vengeance of thy servants\' blood that is shed, \* be    |
| openly showed upon the heathen, in our sight.\                        |
| 12 O let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before thee; \*  |
| according to the greatness of thy power, preserve thou those that are |
| appointed to die.\                                                    |
| 13 And for the blasphemy wherewith our neighbours have blasphemed     |
| thee, \* reward thou them, O Lord, sevenfold into their bosom.\       |
| 14 So we, that are thy people, and sheep of thy pasture, shall give   |
| thee thanks for ever, \* and will alway be showing forth thy praise   |
| from generation to generation.                                        |
