| **Psalm 135. Laudate Nomen.**\                                        |
| O PRAISE the LORD, laud ye the Name of the LORD; \* praise it, O ye   |
| servants of the LORD;\                                                |
| 2 Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, \* in the courts of the     |
| house of our God.\                                                    |
| 3 O praise the LORD, for the LORD is gracious; \* O sing praises unto |
| his Name, for it is lovely.\                                          |
| 4 For why? the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, \* and Israel for |
| his own possession.\                                                  |
| 5 For I know that the LORD is great, \* and that our Lord is above    |
| all gods.\                                                            |
| 6 Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth;   |
| \* and in the sea, and in all deep places.\                           |
| 7 He bringeth forth the clouds from the ends of the world, \* and     |
| sendeth forth lightnings with the rain, bringing the winds out of his |
| treasuries.\                                                          |
| 8 He smote the firstborn of Egypt, \* both of man and beast.\         |
| 9 He hath sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O thou land |
| of Egypt; \* upon Pharaoh, and all his servants.\                     |
| 10 He smote divers nations, \* and slew mighty kings:\                |
| 11 Sihon, king of the Amorites; and Og, the king of Bashan; \* and    |
| all the kingdoms of Canaan;\                                          |
| 12 And gave their land to be an heritage, \* even an heritage unto    |
| Israel his people.\                                                   |
| 13 Thy Name, O LORD, endureth for ever; \* so doth thy memorial, O    |
| LORD, from one generation to another.\                                |
| 14 For the LORD will avenge his people, \* and be gracious unto his   |
| servants.\                                                            |
| 15 As for the images of the heathen, they are but silver and gold; \* |
| the work of men\'s hands.\                                            |
| 16 They have mouths, and speak not; \* eyes have they, but they see   |
| not.\                                                                 |
| 17 They have ears, and yet they hear not; \* neither is there any     |
| breath in their mouths.\                                              |
| 18 They that make them are like unto them; \* and so are all they     |
| that put their trust in them.\                                        |
| 19 Praise the LORD, ye house of Israel; \* praise the LORD, ye house  |
| of Aaron.\                                                            |
| 20 Praise the LORD, ye house of Levi; \* ye that fear the LORD,       |
| praise the LORD.\                                                     |
| 21 Praised be the LORD out of Sion, \* who dwelleth at Jerusalem.     |
