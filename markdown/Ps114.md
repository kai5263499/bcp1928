| **Psalm 114. In exitu Israel.**\                                      |
| WHEN Israel came out of Egypt, \* and the house of Jacob from among   |
| the strange people,\                                                  |
| 2 Judah was his sanctuary, \* and Israel his dominion.\               |
| 3 The sea saw that, and fled; \* Jordan was driven back.\             |
| 4 The mountains skipped like rams, \* and the little hills like young |
| sheep.\                                                               |
| 5 What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? \* and thou       |
| Jordan, that thou wast driven back?\                                  |
| 6 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams? \* and ye little hills,    |
| like young sheep?\                                                    |
| 7 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord: \* at the         |
| presence of the God of Jacob;\                                        |
| 8 Who turned the hard rock into a standing water,\* and the           |
| flint-stone into a springing well.                                    |
