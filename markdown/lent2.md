| 1 And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said |
| unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other |
| poor.\                                                                |
| 2 The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:\                  |
| 3 But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he    |
| had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and    |
| with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own   |
| cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.\           |
| 4 And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take |
| of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man  |
| that was come unto him; but took the poor man\'s lamb, and dressed it |
| for the man that was come to him.\                                    |
| 5 And David\'s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said |
| to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing      |
| shall surely die:\                                                    |
| 6 And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing,  |
| and because he had no pity.\                                          |
| 7 And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD God |
| of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out |
| of the hand of Saul;\                                                 |
| 8 And I gave thee thy master\'s house, and thy master\'s wives into   |
| thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if     |
| that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such  |
| and such things.\                                                     |
| 9 Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do     |
| evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, |
| and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the   |
| sword of the children of Ammon.\                                      |
| 10 Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house;       |
| because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the   |
| Hittite to be thy wife.\                                              |
| 13 And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And    |
| Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou     |
| shalt not die.\                                                       |

| 9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of   |
| God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor         |
| adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,\  |
| 10 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor        |
| extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.\                      |
| 11 And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are           |
| sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and   |
| by the Spirit of our God.\                                            |
| 12 All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient:   |
| all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the     |
| power of any.\                                                        |
| 13 Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall        |
| destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but    |
| for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.\                             |
| 14 And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by |
| his own power.\                                                       |
| 15 Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I    |
| then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an      |
| harlot? God forbid.\                                                  |
| 16 What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one      |
| body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.\                         |
| 17 But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.\                |
| 18 Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body;  |
| but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.\     |
| 19 What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost   |
| which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?\      |

| dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and     |
| said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I.\      |
| 2 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:\ |

| bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;\              |

| I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.\                 |

| to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.\                   |

| 7 Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and     |
| bless thee before the LORD before my death.\                          |

| loveth:\                                                              |

| he may bless thee before his death.\                                  |
| 11 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a |
| hairy man, and I am a smooth man:\                                    |
| 12 My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a  |
| deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.\     |

| obey my voice, and go fetch me them.\                                 |
| 14 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his  |
| mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.\                  |
| 15 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were |
| with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:\      |
| 16 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and |
| upon the smooth of his neck:\                                         |
| 17 And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had         |
| prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.\                            |
| 18 And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said,     |
| Here am I; who art thou, my son?\                                     |
| 19 And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy firstborn; I have    |
| done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of  |
| my venison, that thy soul may bless me.\                              |

| thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.\               |
| 22 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and    |
| said, The voice is Jacob\'s voice, but the hands are the hands of     |
| Esau.\                                                                |
| 23 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his     |
| brother Esau\'s hands: so he blessed him.\                            |
| 24 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.\        |
| 25 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son\'s      |
| venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him,  |
| and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank.\               |
| 26 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my |
| son.\                                                                 |
| 27 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his  |
| raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as    |
| the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:\                    |
| 28 Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of   |
| the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:\                              |

| **[]{#anchor125863}1 It is reported commonly that there is            |
| fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as      |
| named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father\'s wife.\   |
| 2 And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that     |
| hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.\              |
| 3 For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged |
| already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done   |
| this deed,\                                                           |
| 4 In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered          |
| together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,\    |
| 5 To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, |
| that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.\           |
| 6 Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven         |
| leaveneth the whole lump?\                                            |
| 7 Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as   |
| ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for     |
| us:\                                                                  |
| 8 Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with  |
| the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of |
| sincerity and truth.\                                                 |
| 9 I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:\    |
| 10 Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the |
| covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs  |
| go out of the world.\                                                 |
| []{#anchor126925}11 But now I have written unto you not to keep       |
| company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or      |
| covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an           |
| extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.\                         |
| 12 For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not  |
| ye judge them that are within?\                                       |
| 13 But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from     |

| for Rachel thy younger daughter.\                                     |
| 19 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I  |
| should give her to another man: abide with me.\                       |
| 20 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him  |

| 4 The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and       |

| that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together  |

| 6 But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.\            |

| his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after      |

| the wife depart from her husband:\                                    |
| 11 But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled  |
| to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.\           |
| 12 But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife  |
| that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not |
| put her away.\                                                        |

| be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.\                 |
| []{#anchor218653}14 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the  |
| wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else     |
