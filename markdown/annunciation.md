| an angel, so by his cross and passion we may be brought unto the      |

| MOREOVER the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying, Ask thee a sign of   |
| the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above. |
| But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD. And he  |
| said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to   |
| weary men, but will ye weary my God also? Therefore the Lord himself  |
| shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a    |
| son, and shall call his name Immanuel. Butter and honey shall he eat, |
| that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.\            |
|                                                                       |
| The Gospel. St. Luke i. 26.                                           |
|                                                                       |
| AND in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a     |
| city of Galilee, named Nazareth, to a virgin espoused to a man whose  |
| name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin\'s name was    |
| Mary. And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art   |
| highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women. |
| And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her |
| mind what manner of salutation this should be. And the angel said     |
| unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. And,   |
| behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and   |
| shalt call his name JESUS. He shall be great, and shall be called the |
| Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne   |
| of his father David: and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for   |
| ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. Then said Mary unto   |
| the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? And the angel  |
| answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and  |
| the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that   |
| holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of     |
| God. And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son |
| in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called  |
| barren. For with God nothing shall be impossible. And Mary said,      |
| Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. |
| And the angel departed from her.                                      |
