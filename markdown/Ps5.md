| **Psalms 5. Verba mea auribus.**\                                     |
| PONDER my words, O LORD, \* consider my meditation.\                  |
| 2 O hearken thou unto the voice of my calling, my King and my God: \* |
| for unto thee will I make my prayer.\                                 |
| 3 My voice shalt thou hear betimes, O LORD; \* early in the morning   |
| will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.\                 |
| 4 For thou art the God that hast no pleasure in wickedness; \*        |
| neither shall any evil dwell with thee.\                              |
| 5 Such as be foolish shall not stand in thy sight; \* for thou hatest |
| all them that work iniquity.\                                         |
| 6 Thou shalt destroy them that speak lies: \* the LORD will abhor     |
| both the blood-thirsty and deceitful man.\                            |
| 7 But as for me, in the multitude of thy mercy I will come into thine |
| house; \* and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.\     |
| 8 Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness, because of mine enemies; \*  |
| make thy way plain before my face.\                                   |
| 9 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; \* their inward parts  |
| are very wickedness.\                                                 |
| 10 Their throat is an open sepulchre; \* they flatter with their      |
| tongue.\                                                              |
| 11 Destroy thou them, O God; let them perish through their own        |
| imaginations; \* cast them out in the multitude of their ungodliness; |
| for they have rebelled against thee.\                                 |
| 12 And let all them that put their trust in thee rejoice: \* they     |
| shall ever be giving of thanks, because thou defendest them; they     |
| that love thy Name shall be joyful in thee;\                          |
| 13 For thou, LORD, wilt give thy blessing unto the righteous, \* and  |
| with thy favourable kindness wilt thou defend him as with a shield.   |
