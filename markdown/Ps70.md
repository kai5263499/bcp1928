| **Psalm 70. Deus, in adjutorium.**\                                   |
| HASTE thee, O God, to deliver me; \* make haste to help me, O LORD.\  |
| 2 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul; \* let  |
| them be turned backward and put to confusion that wish me evil.\      |
| 3 Let them for their reward be soon brought to shame, \* that cry     |
| over me, There! there!\                                               |
| 4 But let all those that seek thee be joyful and glad in thee: \* and |
| let all such as delight in thy salvation say alway, The Lord be       |
| praised.\                                                             |
| 5 As for me, I am poor and in misery: \* haste thee unto me, O God.\  |
| 6 Thou art my helper, and my redeemer: \* O LORD, make no long        |
| tarrying.                                                             |
