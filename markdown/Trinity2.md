| **[]{#anchor800352}1 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of    |

| 2 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all          |
| mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I  |
| could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.\          |
| 3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I     |
| give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me      |
| nothing.\                                                             |
| 4 Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity   |
| vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,\                               |

| 8 Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall  |
| fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be    |
| knowledge, it shall vanish away.\                                     |
| 9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.\                      |

| shall be done away.\                                                  |
| 11 When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I |
| thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish      |
| things.\                                                              |

| 1 Samuel 20:1-7, 12-42**\                                             |
| 1 And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before       |
| Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin |
| before thy father, that he seeketh my life?\                          |
| 2 And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my    |
| father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will show   |
| it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not    |
| so.\                                                                  |
| []{#anchor2398451}3 And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father    |
| certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he       |
| saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as   |
| the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between  |
| me and death.\                                                        |
| 4 Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will |
| even do it for thee.\                                                 |
| 5 And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and |
| I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I |
| may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.\             |
| 6 If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave |
| of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there is a yearly  |
| sacrifice there for all the family.\                                  |
| 7 If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he |
| be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him.\          |
| 12 And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have    |
| sounded my father about tomorrow any time, or the third day, and,     |
| behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, |
| and show it thee;\                                                    |
| 13 The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my      |
| father to do thee evil, then I will show it thee, and send thee away, |
| that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with thee, as he hath   |
| been with my father.\                                                 |
| 14 And thou shalt not only while yet I live show me the kindness of   |
| the LORD, that I die not:\                                            |
| 15 But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for     |
| ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every   |
| one from the face of the earth.\                                      |
| 16 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let   |
| the LORD even require it at the hand of David\'s enemies.\            |
| 17 And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him:    |
| for he loved him as he loved his own soul.\                           |
| 18 Then Jonathan said to David, Tomorrow is the new moon: and thou    |
| shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.\                     |
| 19 And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down      |
| quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the |
| business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.\            |
| 20 And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I     |
| shot at a mark.\                                                      |
| 21 And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows.   |
| If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side  |
| of thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and   |
| no hurt; as the LORD liveth.\                                         |
| 22 But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are       |
| beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.\           |
| 23 And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of,        |
| behold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever.\                    |
| 24 So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, |
| the king sat him down to eat meat.\                                   |
| 25 And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a     |
| seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul\'s side,  |
| and David\'s place was empty.\                                        |
| 26 Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought,    |
| Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not        |
| clean.\                                                               |
| 27 And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the |
| month, that David\'s place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his |
| son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither           |
| yesterday, nor today?\                                                |
| 28 And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to   |
| go to Bethlehem:\                                                     |
| 29 And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a         |
| sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be     |
| there: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get      |
| away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto  |
| the king\'s table.\                                                   |
| 30 Then Saul\'s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto  |
| him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that    |
| thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto    |
| the confusion of thy mother\'s nakedness?\                            |
| 31 For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt |
| not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him |
| unto me, for he shall surely die.\                                    |
| 32 And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him,          |
| Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?\                      |
| 33 And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew |
| that it was determined of his father to slay David.\                  |
| 34 So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no   |
| meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David,       |
| because his father had done him shame.\                               |
| 35 And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into    |
| the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with     |
| him.\                                                                 |
| 36 And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I     |
| shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.\              |
| 37 And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan |
| had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow    |
| beyond thee?\                                                         |
| 38 And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And |
| Jonathan\'s lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.\      |
| 39 But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the   |
| matter.\                                                              |
| 40 And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him,   |
| Go, carry them to the city.\                                          |
| 41 And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward |
| the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself      |
| three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another,  |
| until David exceeded.\                                                |
| 42 And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have      |
| sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between |
| me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose  |
| and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.\                       |

| minister, saying,\                                                    |
| 2 Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, |
| thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them,     |
| even to the children of Israel.\                                      |

| river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea |
| toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.\               |
| 5 There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days   |
| of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not  |
| fail thee, nor forsake thee.\                                         |
| 6 Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou    |
| divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers  |
| to give them.\                                                        |
| 7 Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe   |
| to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded      |
| thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou    |
| mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.\                             |
| []{#anchor64296}8 This book of the law shall not depart out of thy    |
| mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou       |
| mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for    |

| 10 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,\         |
| 11 Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you |
| victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go |
| in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess |

| 12 And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe   |
| of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,\                                   |
| 13 Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded    |
| you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given    |
| you this land.\                                                       |
| 14 Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the |
| land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass      |
| before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help    |
| them;\                                                                |
| 15 Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath given     |
| you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God    |
| giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession,   |
| and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD\'S servant gave you on this side   |
| Jordan toward the sunrising.\                                         |

| 17 According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we     |

| Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he to           |
| Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him.\           |

| to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.\             |

| the law of thy God which is in thine hand;\                           |

| Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow  |

| great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.\    |
| 30 But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples,    |
| saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?\          |
| 31 And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a |

| 32 I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\      |

| and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but    |
| thine eat and drink?\                                                 |

| rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with    |
| the old.\                                                             |

| 2 That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of Judah; |
| and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were     |
| left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.\                     |
| 3 And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity   |

| of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned    |
| with fire.\                                                           |

| wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God |
| of heaven,\                                                           |
| 5 And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and       |
| terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him  |
| and observe his commandments:\                                        |
| 6 Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou      |
| mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now,  |
| day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess   |
| the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against      |
| thee: both I and my father\'s house have sinned.\                     |
| 7 We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the    |
| commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou         |
| commandest thy servant Moses.\                                        |

| among the nations:\                                                   |
| 9 But if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them;      |
| though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the      |

| 1 Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex |
| certain of the church.\                                               |
| 2 And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.\            |
| 3 And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to     |
| take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)\           |
| 4 And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and          |
| delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending  |
| after Easter to bring him forth to the people.\                       |
| 5 Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without     |
| ceasing of the church unto God for him.\                              |
| 6 And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter   |
| was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the     |
| keepers before the door kept the prison.\                             |
| 7 And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light       |
| shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him  |
| up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his        |
| hands.\                                                               |
| 8 And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. |
| And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee,    |
| and follow me.\                                                       |
| 9 And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true    |
| which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.\            |
| 10 When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto  |
| the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his |
| own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and  |
| forthwith the angel departed from him.\                               |
| 11 And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a       |
| surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out  |
| of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of   |
| the Jews.\                                                            |
| 12 And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary |
| the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered  |
| together praying.\                                                    |
| 13 And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to     |
| hearken, named Rhoda.\                                                |
| 14 And when she knew Peter\'s voice, she opened not the gate for      |
| gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate.\      |
| 15 And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed  |
| that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.\                |
| 16 But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door,   |
| and saw him, they were astonished.\                                   |
| 17 But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace,     |
| declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison.    |
| And he said, Go show these things unto James, and to the brethren.    |
| And he departed, and went into another place.\                        |
| 18 Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the       |
| soldiers, what was become of Peter.\                                  |
| 19 And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined  |
| the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he   |
| went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there abode.\                  |
| 20 And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but   |
| they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the        |
| king\'s chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their        |
| country was nourished by the king\'s country.\                        |
| 21 And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his   |
| throne, and made an oration unto them.\                               |
| 22 And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and |
| not of a man.\                                                        |

| 3 And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round      |

| Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven     |
| trumpets of rams\' horns before the ark of the LORD.\                 |

| 15 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about |
| the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner  |
| seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times.\   |
| 16 And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew     |

| ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and  |
| make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.\                     |

| feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy children\'s for |
| ever, because thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God.\             |
| 10 And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said, these    |
| forty and five years, even since the LORD spake this word unto Moses, |
| while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, lo, |
| I am this day fourscore and five years old.\                          |
| 11 As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent |
| me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war,     |
| both to go out, and to come in.\                                      |
| 12 Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in     |
| that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were there,   |
| and that the cities were great and fenced: if so be the LORD will be  |
| with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the LORD said.\   |
| 13 And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh   |
| Hebron for an inheritance.\                                           |

| Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls |
| of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped, |
| then they were very wroth,\                                           |

| higher places, I even set the people after their families with their  |
| swords, their spears, and their bows.\                                |

| rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them:      |
| remember the Lord, which is great and terrible, and fight for your    |

| us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all |
| of us to the wall, every one unto his work.\                          |

| the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the    |

| 18 For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and  |
| so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.\               |
| 19 And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of  |
