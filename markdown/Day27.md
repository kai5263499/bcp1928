| **Psalm 120. Ad Dominum.**\                                           |
| WHEN I was in trouble, I called upon the LORD, \* and he heard me.\   |
| 2 Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, \* and from a deceitful   |
| tongue.\                                                              |
| 3 What reward shall be given or done unto thee, thou false tongue? \* |
| even mighty and sharp arrows, with hot burning coals.\                |
| 4 Woe is me, that I am constrained to dwell with Meshech, \* and to   |
| have my habitation among the tents of Kedar!\                         |
| 5 My soul hath long dwelt among them \* that are enemies unto peace.\ |
| 6 I labour for peace; but when I speak unto them thereof, \* they     |
| make them ready to battle.\                                           |
| \                                                                     |

| Psalm 121. Levavi oculos.**\                                          |
| I WILL lift up mine eyes unto the hills; \* from whence cometh my     |
| help?\                                                                |
| 2 My help cometh even from the LORD, \* who hath made heaven and      |
| earth.\                                                               |
| 3 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved; \* and he that keepeth     |
| thee will not sleep.\                                                 |
| 4 Behold, he that keepeth Israel \* shall neither slumber nor sleep.\ |
| 5 The LORD himself is thy keeper; \* the LORD is thy defence upon thy |
| right hand;\                                                          |
| 6 So that the sun shall not burn thee by day, \* neither the moon by  |
| night.\                                                               |

| that shall keep thy soul.\                                            |
| 8 The LORD shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming in, \* from   |
| this time forth for evermore.\                                        |
| \                                                                     |

| Psalm 122. Laetatus sum.**\                                           |
| I WAS glad when they said unto me, \* We will go into the house of    |
| the LORD.\                                                            |
| 2 Our feet shall stand in thy gates, \* O Jerusalem.\                 |
| 3 Jerusalem is built as a city \* that is at unity in itself.\        |
| 4 For thither the tribes go up, even the tribes of the LORD, \* to    |
| testify unto Israel, to give thanks unto the Name of the LORD.\       |
| 5 For there is the seat of judgment, \* even the seat of the house of |
| David.\                                                               |
| 6 O pray for the peace of Jerusalem; \* they shall prosper that love  |
| thee.\                                                                |
| 7 Peace be within thy walls, \* and plenteousness within thy          |

| 8 For my brethren and companions\' sakes, \* I will wish thee         |
| prosperity.\                                                          |
| 9 Yea, because of the house of the LORD our God, \* I will seek to do |
| thee good.\                                                           |

| Psalm 123. Ad te levavi oculos meos.**\                               |
| UNTO thee lift I up mine eyes, \* O thou that dwellest in the         |
| heavens.\                                                             |
| 2 Behold, even as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their    |
| masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress,   |
| \* even so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until he have mercy   |
| upon us.\                                                             |
| 3 Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us; \* for we are       |
| utterly despised.\                                                    |
| 4 Our soul is filled with the scornful reproof of the wealthy, \* and |
| with the despitefulness of the proud.\                                |
| \                                                                     |

| Psalm 124. Nisi quia Dominus.**\                                      |
| IF the LORD himself had not been on our side, now may Israel say; \*  |
| if the LORD himself had not been on our side, when men rose up        |
| against us;\                                                          |
| 2 They had swallowed us up alive; \* when they were so wrathfully     |
| displeased at us.\                                                    |
| 3 Yea, the waters had drowned us, \* and the stream had gone over our |
| soul.\                                                                |
| 4 The deep waters of the proud \* had gone even over our soul.\       |
| 5 But praised be the LORD, \* who hath not given us over for a prey   |
| unto their teeth.\                                                    |
| 6 Our soul is escaped even as a bird out of the snare of the fowler;  |
| \* the snare is broken, and we are delivered.\                        |
| 7 Our help standeth in the Name of the LORD, \* who hath made heaven  |
| and earth.\                                                           |

| Psalm 125. Qui confidunt.**\                                          |

| 2 The hills stand about Jerusalem; \* even so standeth the LORD round |
| about his people, from this time forth for evermore.\                 |
| 3 For the sceptre of the ungodly shall not abide upon the lot of the  |
| righteous; \* lest the righteous put their hand unto wickedness.\     |
| 4 Do well, O LORD, \* unto those that are good and true of heart.\    |
| 5 As for such as turn back unto their own wickedness, \* the LORD     |
| shall lead them forth with the evil doers; but peace shall be upon    |
| Israel.\                                                              |

| WHEN the LORD turned again the captivity of Sion, then were we like   |
| unto them that dream.\                                                |
| 2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, \* and our tongue with     |
| joy.\                                                                 |

| 4 Yea, the LORD hath done great things for us already; \* whereof we  |
| rejoice.\                                                             |
| 5 Turn our captivity, O LORD, \* as the rivers in the south.\         |
| 6 They that sow in tears \* shall reap in joy.\                       |
| 7 He that now goeth on his way weeping, and beareth forth good seed,  |
| \* shall doubtless come again with joy, and bring his sheaves with    |
| him.\                                                                 |

| 2 Except the LORD keep the city, \* the watchman waketh but in vain.\ |
| 3 It is but lost labour that ye haste to rise up early, and so late   |

| 4 Lo, children, and the fruit of the womb, \* are an heritage and     |
| gift that cometh of the LORD.\                                        |

| have not prevailed against me.\                                       |
| 3 The plowers plowed upon my back, \* and made long furrows.\         |
| 4 But the righteous LORD \* hath hewn the snares of the ungodly in    |

| 3 If thou, LORD, wilt be extreme to mark what is done amiss, \* O     |
| Lord, who may abide it?\                                              |
| 4 For there is mercy with thee; \* therefore shalt thou be feared.\   |
| 5 I look for the LORD; my soul doth wait for him; \* in his word is   |
| my trust.\                                                            |
| 6 My soul fleeth unto the Lord before the morning watch; \* I say,    |
| before the morning watch.\                                            |
| 7 O Israel, trust in the LORD; for with the LORD there is mercy, \*   |
| and with him is plenteous redemption.\                                |
| 8 And he shall redeem Israel \* from all his sins.\                   |
| \                                                                     |
| **\                                                                   |
| Psalm 131. Domine, non est.**\                                        |
| LORD, I am not high-minded; \* I have no proud looks.\                |
| 2 I do not exercise myself in great matters \* which are too high for |
| me.\                                                                  |
| 3 But I refrain my soul, and keep it low, like as a child that is     |
| weaned from his mother: \* yea, my soul is even as a weaned child.\   |
| 4 O Israel, trust in the LORD \* from this time forth for evermore.\  |
|                                                                       |
