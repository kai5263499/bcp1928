| 14 These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:\ |
| []{#anchor323068}15 But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how    |
| thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the     |
| church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.\        |
| 16 And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was |
| manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels,       |
| preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up     |
| into glory.\                                                          |
| []{#anchor324326}1 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the     |
| latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to         |
| seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;\                           |
| 2 Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a   |
| hot iron;\                                                            |
| 3 Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which    |
| God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which       |
| believe and know the truth.\                                          |

| be received with thanksgiving:\                                       |
| 5 For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.\                |
| 6 If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt |
| be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of      |
| faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.\            |
| []{#anchor325367}7 But refuse profane and old wives\' fables, and     |
| exercise thyself rather unto godliness.\                              |
| 8 For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable   |
| unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that  |
| which is to come.\                                                    |

| I will send rain upon the earth.\                                     |

| 3 And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house. (Now  |
| Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:\                                     |
| 4 For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that  |

| and fed them with bread and water.)\                                  |
| 5 And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of |
| water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save    |
| the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.\         |
| 6 So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab   |
| went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.\    |
| 7 And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew  |
| him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord Elijah?\   |

| servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?\                           |
| 10 As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither |
| my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is not     |
| there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found     |
| thee not.\                                                            |

| 12 And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that    |
| the spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and so    |
| when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: |
| but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.\                       |
| 13 Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets  |
| of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD\'S prophets by      |
| fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?\                  |

| 25 And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock  |
| for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the  |
| name of your gods, but put no fire under.\                            |
| 26 And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed   |
| it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon,      |
| saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that         |
| answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.\             |
| 27 And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said,    |
| Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing,  |
| or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be       |
| awaked.\                                                              |
| 28 And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with   |
| knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.\             |
| 29 And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied     |
| until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there   |
| was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.\         |
| 30 And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all    |
| the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD  |
| that was broken down.\                                                |
| 36 And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening     |
| sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of   |
| Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art |
| God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all    |
| these things at thy word.\                                            |
| 37 Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou art  |
| the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.\      |
| 38 Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice,  |
| and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water   |
| that was in the trench.\                                              |
| 39 And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they |
| said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.\              |
| 40 And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one  |
| of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to   |
| the brook Kishon, and slew them there.\                               |
| 41 And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there   |
| is a sound of abundance of rain.\                                     |
| 42 So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top |
| of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face  |
| between his knees,\                                                   |
| 43 And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he    |
| went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go      |
| again seven times.\                                                   |
| 44 And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold,     |
| there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man\'s hand. And  |
| he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee      |
| down, that the rain stop thee not.\                                   |
| 45 And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black   |
| with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and  |
| went to Jezreel.\                                                     |
| 46 And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his       |
| loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.\               |

| unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand   |
| thou there, or sit here under my footstool:\                          |

| thou art become a transgressor of the law.\                           |

| 5 But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is  |

| 11 Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which |
| cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.\                        |
| 12 Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the  |
| Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?\               |
| 13 But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father    |
| hath not planted, shall be rooted up.\                                |
| 14 Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the     |

| 17 Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth |
| goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?\              |
| 18 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from    |
| the heart; and they defile the man.\                                  |
| 19 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,   |

| may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house:  |
| and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem |
| good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.\             |

| I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him   |
| down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.\ |
| 5 But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy     |
| spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?\                            |
| 6 And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite,   |
| and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it     |
