| **Psalm 96. Cantate Domino.**\                                        |
| O SING unto the LORD a new song; \* sing unto the LORD, all the whole |
| earth.\                                                               |
| 2 Sing unto the LORD, and praise his Name; \* be telling of his       |
| salvation from day to day.\                                           |
| 3 Declare his honour unto the heathen, \* and his wonders unto all    |
| peoples.\                                                             |
| 4 For the LORD is great, and cannot worthily be praised;\* he is more |
| to be feared than all gods.\                                          |
| 5 As for all the gods of the heathen, they are but idols; \* but it   |
| is the LORD that made the heavens.\                                   |
| 6 Glory and worship are before him; \* power and honour are in his    |
| sanctuary.\                                                           |
| 7 Ascribe unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the peoples, \* ascribe     |
| unto the LORD worship and power.\                                     |
| 8 Ascribe unto the LORD the honour due unto his Name; \* bring        |
| presents, and come into his courts.\                                  |
| 9 O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness; \* let the whole      |
| earth stand in awe of him.\                                           |
| 10 Tell it out among the heathen, that the LORD is King, and that it  |
| is he who hath made the round world so fast that it cannot be moved;  |
| \* and how that he shall judge the peoples righteously.\              |
| 11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; \* let the sea |
| make a noise, and all that therein is.\                               |
| 12 Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it; \* then shall all  |
| the trees of the wood rejoice before the LORD.\                       |
| 13 For he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth; \* and with       |
| righteousness to judge the world, and the peoples with his truth.     |
