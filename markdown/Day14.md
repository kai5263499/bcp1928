| **Psalm 71. In te, Domine, speravi.**\                                |
| IN thee, O LORD, have I put my trust; let me never be put to          |
| confusion, \* but rid me and deliver me in thy righteousness; incline |
| thine ear unto me, and save me.\                                      |
| 2 Be thou my stronghold, whereunto I may alway resort: \* thou hast   |
| promised to help me, for thou art my house of defence, and my         |
| castle.\                                                              |
| 3 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the ungodly, \* out of the |
| hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.\                               |
| 4 For thou, O Lord GOD, art the thing that I long for: \* thou art my |
| hope, even from my youth.\                                            |
| 5 Through thee have I been holden up ever since I was born: \* thou   |
| art he that took me out of my mother\'s womb: my praise shall be      |
| alway of thee.\                                                       |
| 6 I am become as it were a monster unto many, \* but my sure trust is |
| in thee.\                                                             |
| 7 O let my mouth be filled with thy praise, \* that I may sing of thy |
| glory and honour all the day long.\                                   |
| 8 Cast me not away in the time of age; \* forsake me not when my      |
| strength faileth me.\                                                 |
| 9 For mine enemies speak against me; \* and they that lay wait for my |
| soul take their counsel together, saying,\                            |
| 10 God hath forsaken him; \* persecute him, and take him, for there   |
| is none to deliver him.\                                              |
| 11 Go not far from me, O God; \* my God, haste thee to help me.\      |
| 12 Let them be confounded and perish that are against my soul; \* let |
| them be covered with shame and dishonour that seek to do me evil.\    |
| 13 As for me, I will patiently abide alway, \* and will praise thee   |
| more and more.\                                                       |
| 14 My mouth shall daily speak of thy righteousness and salvation; \*  |
| for I know no end thereof.\                                           |
| 15 I will go forth in the strength of the Lord GOD, \* and will make  |
| mention of thy righteousness only.\                                   |
| 16 Thou, O God, hast taught me from my youth up until now; \*         |
| therefore will I tell of thy wondrous works.\                         |
| 17 Forsake me not, O God, in mine old age, when I am gray-headed, \*  |
| until I have showed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power  |
| to all them that are yet for to come.\                                |
| 18 Thy righteousness, O God, is very high, \* and great things are    |
| they that thou hast done: O God, who is like unto thee!\              |
| 19 O what great troubles and adversities hast thou showed me ! and    |
| yet didst thou turn and refresh me; \* yea, and broughtest me from    |
| the deep of the earth again.\                                         |
| 20 Thou hast brought me to great honour, \* and comforted me on every |
| side:\                                                                |
| 21 Therefore will I praise thee, and thy faithfulness, O God, playing |
| upon an instrument of music: \* unto thee will I sing upon the harp,  |
| O thou Holy One of Israel.\                                           |
| 22 My lips will be glad when I sing unto thee; \* and so will my soul |
| whom thou hast delivered.\                                            |
| 23 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long;   |
| \* for they are confounded and brought unto shame that seek to do me  |
| evil.\                                                                |
| \                                                                     |
| **\                                                                   |
| Psalm 72. Deus, judicium.**\                                          |
| GIVE the King thy judgments, O God, \* and thy righteousness unto the |
| King\'s son.\                                                         |
| 2 Then shall he judge thy people according unto right, \* and defend  |
| the poor.\                                                            |
| 3 The mountains also shall bring peace, \* and the little hills       |
| righteousness unto the people.\                                       |
| 4 He shall keep the simple folk by their right, \* defend the         |
| children of the poor, and punish the wrong doer.\                     |
| 5 They shall fear thee, as long as the sun and moon endureth, \* from |
| one generation to another.\                                           |
| 6 He shall come down like the rain upon the mown grass, \* even as    |
| the drops that water the earth.\                                      |
| 7 In his time shall the righteous flourish; \* yea, and abundance of  |
| peace, so long as the moon endureth.\                                 |
| 8 His dominion shall be also from the one sea to the other, \* and    |
| from the River unto the world\'s end.\                                |
| 9 They that dwell in the wilderness shall kneel before him; \* his    |
| enemies shall lick the dust.\                                         |
| 10 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall give presents; \* the |
| kings of Arabia and Saba shall bring gifts.\                          |
| 11 All kings shall fall down before him; \* all nations shall do him  |
| service.\                                                             |
| 12 For he shall deliver the poor when he crieth; \* the needy also,   |
| and him that hath no helper.\                                         |
| 13 He shall be favourable to the simple and needy, \* and shall       |
| preserve the souls of the poor.\                                      |
| 14 He shall deliver their souls from falsehood and wrong; \* and dear |
| shall their blood be in his sight.\                                   |
| 15 He shall live, and unto him shall be given of the gold of Arabia;  |
| \* prayer shall be made ever unto him, and daily shall he be          |
| praised.\                                                             |
| 16 There shall be an heap of corn in the earth, high upon the hills ; |
| the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: \* and they of the city   |
| shall flourish like grass upon the earth.\                            |
| 17 His Name shall endure for ever; his Name shall remain under the    |
| sun among the posterities, which shall be blessed in him; \* and all  |
| the nations shall praise him.\                                        |
| 18 Blessed be the LORD God, even the God of Israel, \* which only     |

| []{#anchor445248}Evening Prayer.\                                     |
| **\                                                                   |
| Psalm 73. Quam bonus Israel!**\                                       |
| TRULY God is loving unto Israel: \* even unto such as are of a clean  |
| heart.\                                                               |
| 2 Nevertheless, my feet were almost gone, \* my treadings had         |
| well-nigh slipt.\                                                     |
| 3 And why? I was grieved at the wicked: \* I do also see the ungodly  |
| in such prosperity.\                                                  |
| 4 For they are in no peril of death; \* but are lusty and strong.\    |
| 5 They come in no misfortune like other folk; \* neither are they     |
| plagued like other men.\                                              |
| 6 And this is the cause that they are so holden with pride, \* and    |
| cruelty covereth them as a garment.\                                  |
| 7 Their eyes swell with fatness, \* and they do even what they lust.\ |
| 8 They corrupt other, and speak of wicked blasphemy; \* their talking |
| is against the Most High.\                                            |
| 9 For they stretch forth their mouth unto the heaven, \* and their    |
| tongue goeth through the world.\                                      |
| 10 Therefore fall the people unto them, \* and thereout suck they no  |
| small advantage.\                                                     |
| 11 Tush, say they, how should God perceive it? \* is there knowledge  |
| in the Most High?\                                                    |
| 12 Lo, these are the ungodly, \* these prosper in the world, and      |
| these have riches in possession:\                                     |
| 13 And I said, Then have I cleansed my heart in vain, \* and washed   |
| my hands in innocency.\                                               |
| 14 All the day long have I been punished, \* and chastened every      |
| morning.\                                                             |
| 15 Yea, and I had almost said even as they; \* but lo, then I should  |
| have condemned the generation of thy children.\                       |
| 16 Then thought I to understand this; \* but it was too hard for me,\ |
| 17 Until I went into the sanctuary of God: \* then understood I the   |
| end of these men;\                                                    |
| 18 Namely, how thou dost set them in slippery places, \* and castest  |
| them down, and destroyest them.\                                      |
| 19 O how suddenly do they consume, \* perish, and come to a fearful   |
| end!\                                                                 |
| 20 Yea, even like as a dream when one awaketh; \* so shalt thou make  |
| their image to vanish out of the city.\                               |
| 21 Thus my heart was grieved, \* and it went even through my reins.\  |
| 22 So foolish was I, and ignorant, \* even as it were a beast before  |
| thee.\                                                                |
| 23 Nevertheless, I am alway by thee; \* for thou hast holden me by my |
| right hand.\                                                          |
| 24 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, \* and after that receive me |
| with glory.\                                                          |
| 25 Whom have I in heaven but thee? \* and there is none upon earth    |
| that I desire in comparison of thee.\                                 |
| 26 My flesh and my heart faileth; \* but God is the strength of my    |
| heart, and my portion for ever.\                                      |
| 27 For lo, they that forsake thee shall perish; \* thou hast          |
| destroyed all them that are unfaithful unto thee.\                    |
| 28 But it is good for me to hold me fast by God, to put my trust in   |
| the Lord GOD, \* and to speak of all thy works in the gates of the    |
| daughter of Sion.\                                                    |
| \                                                                     |
| **\                                                                   |
| Psalm 74. Ut quid, Deus?**\                                           |
| O GOD, wherefore art thou absent from us so long? \* why is thy wrath |
| so hot against the sheep of thy pasture?\                             |
| 2 O think upon thy congregation, \* whom thou hast purchased, and     |
| redeemed of old.\                                                     |
| 3 Think upon the tribe of thine inheritance, \* and Mount Sion,       |
| wherein thou hast dwelt.\                                             |
| 4 Lift up thy feet, that thou mayest utterly destroy every enemy, \*  |
| which hath done evil in thy sanctuary.\                               |
| 5 Thine adversaries roar in the midst of thy congregations, \* and    |
| set up their banners for tokens.\                                     |
| 6 He that hewed timber afore out of the thick trees, \* was known to  |
| bring it to an excellent work.\                                       |
| 7 But now they break down all the carved work thereof \* with axes    |
| and hammers.\                                                         |
| 8 They have set fire upon thy holy places, \* and have defiled the    |
| dwelling-place of thy Name, even unto the ground.\                    |
| 9 Yea, they said in their hearts, Let us make havoc of them           |
| altogether: \* thus have they burnt up all the houses of God in the   |
| land.\                                                                |
| 10 We see not our tokens; there is not one prophet more; \* no, not   |
| one is there among us, that understandeth any more.\                  |
| 11 O God, how long shall the adversary do this dishonour? \* shall    |
| the enemy blaspheme thy Name for ever?\                               |
| 12 Why withdrawest thou thy hand? \* why pluckest thou not thy right  |
| hand out of thy bosom to consume the enemy?\                          |
| 13 For God is my King of old; \* the help that is done upon earth, he |
| doeth it himself.\                                                    |
| 14 Thou didst divide the sea through thy power; \* thou brakest the   |
| heads of the dragons in the waters.\                                  |
| 15 Thou smotest the heads of leviathan in pieces, \* and gavest him   |
| to be meat for the people of the wilderness.\                         |
| 16 Thou broughtest out fountains and waters out of the hard rocks; \* |
| thou driedst up mighty waters.\                                       |
| 17 The day is thine, and the night is thine; \* thou hast prepared    |
| the light and the sun.\                                               |
| 18 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth; \* thou hast made      |
| summer and winter.\                                                   |
| 19 Remember this, O LORD, how the enemy hath rebuked; \* and how the  |
| foolish people hath blasphemed thy Name.\                             |
| 20 O deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the multitude of    |
| the enemies; \* and forget not the congregation of the poor for       |
| ever.\                                                                |
| 21 Look upon the covenant; \* for all the earth is full of darkness   |
| and cruel habitations.\                                               |
| 22 O let not the simple go away ashamed; \* but let the poor and      |
| needy give praise unto thy Name.\                                     |
| 23 Arise, O God, maintain thine own cause; \* remember how the        |
| foolish man blasphemeth thee daily.\                                  |
| 24 Forget not the voice of thine enemies: \* the presumption of them  |
| that hate thee increaseth ever more and more.                         |
|                                                                       |
