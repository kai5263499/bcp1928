| **Psalm 131. Domine, non est.**\                                      |
| LORD, I am not high-minded; \* I have no proud looks.\                |
| 2 I do not exercise myself in great matters \* which are too high for |
| me.\                                                                  |
| 3 But I refrain my soul, and keep it low, like as a child that is     |
| weaned from his mother: \* yea, my soul is even as a weaned child.\   |
| 4 O Israel, trust in the LORD \* from this time forth for evermore.   |
