**Psalm 65. Te decet hymnus.**\
THOU, O God, art praised in Sion; \* and unto thee shall the vow be
performed in Jerusalem.\
2 Thou that hearest the prayer, \* unto thee shall all flesh come.\
3 My misdeeds prevail against me: \* O be thou merciful unto our sins.\
4 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and receivest unto thee: \* he
shall dwell in thy court, and shall be satisfied with the pleasures of
thy house, even of thy holy temple.\
5 Thou shalt show us wonderful things in thy righteousness, O God of our
salvation; \* thou that art the hope of all the ends of the earth, and
of them that remain in the broad sea.\
6 Who in his strength setteth fast the mountains, \* and is girded about
with power.\
7 Who stilleth the raging of the sea, \* and the noise of his waves, and
the madness of the peoples.\
8 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts of the earth shall be
afraid at thy tokens, \* thou that makest the out-goings of the morning
and evening to praise thee.\
9 Thou visitest the earth, and blessest it; \* thou makest it very
plenteous.\
10 The river of God is full of water: \* thou preparest their corn, for
so thou providest for the earth.\
11 Thou waterest her furrows; thou sendest rain into the little valleys
thereof; \* thou makest it soft with the drops of rain, and blessest the
increase of it.\
12 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; \* and thy clouds drop
fatness.\
13 They shall drop upon the dwellings of the wilderness; \* and the
little hills shall rejoice on every side.\
14 The folds shall be full of sheep; \* the valleys also shall stand so
thick with corn, that they shall laugh and sing.\

**Psalm 66. Jubilate Deo.**\
O BE joyful in God, all ye lands; \* sing praises unto the honour of his
Name; make his praise to be glorious.\
2 Say unto God, O how wonderful art thou in thy works! \* through the
greatness of thy power shall thine enemies bow down unto thee.\
3 For all the world shall worship thee, \* sing of thee, and praise thy
Name.\
4 O come hither, and behold the works of God; \* how wonderful he is in
his doing toward the children of men.\
5 He turned the sea into dry land, \* so that they went through the
water on foot; there did we rejoice thereof.\
6 He ruleth with his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: \* and
such as will not believe shall not be able to exalt themselves.\
7 O praise our God, ye peoples, \* and make the voice of his praise to
be heard;\
8 Who holdeth our soul in life; \* and suffereth not our feet to slip.\
9 For thou, O God, hast proved us; \* thou also hast tried us, like as
silver is tried.\
10 Thou broughtest us into the snare; \* and laidest trouble upon our
loins.\
11 Thou sufferedst men to ride over our heads; \* we went through fire
and water, and thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.\
12 I will go into thine house with burnt-offerings, and will pay thee my
vows, \* which I promised with my lips, and spake with my mouth, when I
was in trouble.\
13 I will offer unto thee fat burnt-sacrifices, with the incense of
rams; \* I will offer bullocks and goats.\
14 O come hither, and hearken, all ye that fear God; \* and I will tell
you what he hath done for my soul.\
15 I called unto him with my mouth, \* and gave him praises with my
tongue.\
16 If I incline unto wickedness with mine heart, \* the Lord will not
hear me.\
17 But God hath heard me; \* and considered the voice of my prayer.\
18 Praised be God, who hath not cast out my prayer, \* nor turned his
mercy from me.\

**Psalm 67. Deus misereatur.**\
GOD be merciful unto us, and bless us, \* and show us the light of his
countenance, and be merciful unto us;\
2 That thy way may be known upon earth, \* thy saving health among all
nations.\
3 Let the peoples praise thee, O God; \* yea, let all the peoples praise
thee.\
4 O let the nations rejoice and be glad; \* for thou shalt judge the
folk righteously, and govern the nations upon earth.\
5 Let the peoples praise thee, O God; \* yea, let all the peoples praise
thee.\
6 Then shall the earth bring forth her increase; \* and God, even our
own God, shall give us his blessing.\
7 God shall bless us; \* and all the ends of the world shall fear him.
