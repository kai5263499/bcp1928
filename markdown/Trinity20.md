| 16 And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good    |
| thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?\                      |
| 17 And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good |
| but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the     |
| commandments.\                                                        |

| Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not  |
| bear false witness,\                                                  |

| neighbour as thyself.\                                                |

| youth up: what lack I yet?\                                           |
| 21 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that     |
| thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in      |
| heaven: and come and follow me.\                                      |

| for he had great possessions.\                                        |
| 23 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a  |
| rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.\              |
| 24 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through   |

| God.\                                                                 |

| Who then can be saved?\                                               |
| []{#anchor756028}26 But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With   |

| 27 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken    |
| all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?\                |
| 28 And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which     |
| have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit   |
| in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones,    |
| judging the twelve tribes of Israel.\                                 |

| the heaven all the days of their life.\                               |

| 22 And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold,  |
| even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the  |
| sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and |
| two changes of garments.\                                             |

| and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of      |
| garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them  |
| before him.\                                                          |

| bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they           |
| departed.\                                                            |

| sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?\                  |

| ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider |
| not that they do evil.\                                               |
| 2 Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to     |
| utter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and thou upon       |
| earth: therefore let thy words be few.\                               |
| 3 For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool\'s |
| voice is known by multitude of words.\                                |
| 4 When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath   |
| no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.\                |
| 5 Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest  |

| 33 Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which       |
| planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress |
| in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into |
| a far country:\                                                       |
| 34 And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to  |
| the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.\            |
| 35 And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed     |
| another, and stoned another.\                                         |
| 36 Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did    |
| unto them likewise.\                                                  |
| 37 But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will       |
| reverence my son.\                                                    |
| 38 But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves,   |
| This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his      |
| inheritance.\                                                         |
| 39 And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew    |
| him.\                                                                 |
| 40 When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do    |
| unto those husbandmen?\                                               |
| 41 They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and |
| will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render   |
| him the fruits in their seasons.\                                     |
| 42 Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The    |
| stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the |
| corner: this is the Lord\'s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?\ |
| 43 Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from   |
| you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.\        |
| 44 And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on     |
| whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.\               |
| 45 And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables,   |
| they perceived that he spake of them.\                                |
