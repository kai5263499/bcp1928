| **Psalm 123. Ad te levavi oculos meos.**\                             |
| UNTO thee lift I up mine eyes, \* O thou that dwellest in the         |
| heavens.\                                                             |
| 2 Behold, even as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their    |
| masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress,   |
| \* even so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until he have mercy   |
| upon us.\                                                             |
| 3 Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us; \* for we are       |
| utterly despised.\                                                    |
| 4 Our soul is filled with the scornful reproof of the wealthy, \* and |
| with the despitefulness of the proud.                                 |
