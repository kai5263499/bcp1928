| **Psalm 107. Confitemini Domino.**\                                   |
| O GIVE thanks unto the LORD, for he is gracious, \* and his mercy     |
| endureth for ever.\                                                   |
| 2 Let them give thanks whom the LORD hath redeemed, \* and delivered  |
| from the hand of the enemy;\                                          |
| 3 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the     |
| west; \* from the north, and from the south.\                         |
| 4 They went astray in the wilderness out of the way, \* and found no  |
| city to dwell in.\                                                    |
| 5 Hungry and thirsty, \* their soul fainted in them.\                 |
| 6 So they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, \* and he delivered   |
| them from their distress.\                                            |
| 7 He led them forth by the right way, \* that they might go to the    |
| city where they dwelt.\                                               |
| 8 O that men would therefore praise the LORD for his goodness; \* and |
| declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men!\           |
| 9 For he satisfieth the empty soul, \* and filleth the hungry soul    |
| with goodness.\                                                       |
| 10 Such as sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death, \* being fast |
| bound in misery and iron;\                                            |
| 11 Because they rebelled against the words of the Lord, \* and        |
| lightly regarded the counsel of the Most Highest;\                    |
| 12 He also brought down their heart through heaviness: \* they fell   |
| down, and there was none to help them.\                               |
| 13 SO when they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, \* he delivered |
| them out of their distress.\                                          |
| 14 For he brought them out of darkness, and out of the shadow of      |
| death, \* and brake their bonds in sunder.\                           |
| 15 O that men would therefore praise the LORD for his goodness; \*    |
| and declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men !\      |
| 16 For he hath broken the gates of brass, \* and smitten the bars of  |
| iron in sunder.\                                                      |
| 17 Foolish men are plagued for their offence, \* and because of their |
| wickedness.\                                                          |
| 18 Their soul abhorred all manner of meat, \* and they were even hard |
| at death\'s door.\                                                    |
| 19 So when they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, \* he delivered |
| them out of their distress.\                                          |
| 20 He sent his word, and healed them; \* and they were saved from     |
| their destruction.\                                                   |
| 21 O that men would therefore praise the LORD for his goodness; \*    |
| and declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men !\      |
| 22 That they would offer unto him the sacrifice of thanksgiving, \*   |
| and tell out his works with gladness!\                                |
| 23 They that go down to the sea in ships, \* and occupy their         |
| business in great waters;\                                            |
| 24 These men see the works of the LORD, \* and his wonders in the     |
| deep.\                                                                |
| 25 For at his word the stormy wind ariseth, \* which lifteth up the   |
| waves thereof.\                                                       |
| 26 They are carried up to the heaven, and down again to the deep; \*  |
| their soul melteth away because of the trouble.\                      |
| 27 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, \* and are   |
| at their wit\'s end.\                                                 |
| 28 SO when they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, \* he delivereth  |
| them out of their distress.\                                          |
| 29 For he maketh the storm to cease, \* so that the waves thereof are |
| still.\                                                               |
| 30 Then are they glad, because they are at rest; \* and so he         |
| bringeth them unto the haven where they would be.\                    |
| 31 O that men would therefore praise the LORD for his goodness; \*    |
| and declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men!\       |
| 32 That they would exalt him also in the congregation of the people,  |
| \* and praise him in the seat of the elders!\                         |
| 33 He turneth the floods into a wilderness, \* and drieth up the      |
| water-springs.\                                                       |
| 34 A fruitful land maketh he barren, \* for the wickedness of them    |
| that dwell therein.\                                                  |
| 35 Again, he maketh the wilderness a standing water, \* and           |
| water-springs of a dry ground.\                                       |
| 36 And there he setteth the hungry, \* that they may build them a     |
| city to dwell in;\                                                    |
| 37 That they may sow their land, and plant vineyards, \* to yield     |
| them fruits of increase.\                                             |
| 38 He blesseth them, so that they multiply exceedingly; \* and        |
| suffereth not their cattle to decrease.\                              |
| 39 And again, when they are minished and brought low \* through       |
| oppression, through any plague or trouble;\                           |
| 40 Though he suffer them to be evil entreated through tyrants, \* and |
| let them wander out of the way in the wilderness;\                    |
| 41 Yet helpeth he the poor out of misery, \* and maketh him           |
| households like a flock of sheep.\                                    |
| 42 The righteous will consider this, and rejoice; \* and the mouth of |
| all wickedness shall be stopped.\                                     |
| 43 Whoso is wise, will ponder these things; \* and they shall         |
| understand the loving-kindness of the LORD.\                          |
|                                                                       |

| O GOD, my heart is ready, my heart is ready; \* I will sing, and give |
| praise with the best member that I have.\                             |
| 2 Awake, thou lute and harp; \* I myself will awake right early.\     |
| 3 I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the peoples; \* I will  |
| sing praises unto thee among the nations.\                            |
| 4 For thy mercy is greater than the heavens, \* and thy truth         |
| reacheth unto the clouds.\                                            |
| 5 Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens, \* and thy glory above    |
| all the earth;\                                                       |
| 6 That thy beloved may be delivered: \* let thy right hand save them, |
| and hear thou me.\                                                    |
| 7 God hath spoken in his holiness; \* I will rejoice therefore, and   |
| divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.\                  |
| 8 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; \* Ephraim also is the        |
| strength of my head; Judah is my lawgiver;\                           |
| 9 Moab is my wash-pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; \* upon     |
| Philistia will I triumph.\                                            |
| 10 Who will lead me into the strong city? \* and who will bring me    |

| 11 Hast not thou forsaken us, O God? \* and wilt not thou, O God, go  |
| forth with our hosts?\                                                |

| HOLD not thy tongue, O God of my praise; \* for the mouth of the      |
| ungodly, yea, the mouth of the deceitful is opened upon me.\          |
| 2 And they have spoken against me with false tongues; \* they         |
| compassed me about also with words of hatred, and fought against me   |
| without a cause.\                                                     |

| 10 Let the extortioner consume all that he hath; \* and let the       |
| stranger spoil his labour.\                                           |
| 11 Let there be no man to pity him, \* nor to have compassion upon    |
| his fatherless children.\                                             |
| 12 Let his posterity be destroyed; \* and in the NEXT                 |

| memorial of them from off the earth;\                                 |
| 15 And that, because his mind was not to do good; \* but persecuted   |
| the poor helpless man, that he might slay him that was vexed at the   |

| 16 His delight was in cursing, and it shall happen unto him; \* he    |
| loved not blessing, therefore shall it be far from him.\              |
| 17 He clothed himself with cursing like as with a raiment, \* and it  |
| shall come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.\  |
| 18 Let it be unto him as the cloak that he hath upon him, \* and as   |
| the girdle that he is alway girded withal.\                           |
| 19 Let it thus happen from the LORD unto mine enemies, \* and to      |

| 24 I am become also a reproach unto them: \* they that look upon me   |
| shake their heads.\                                                   |
| 25 Help me, O LORD my God; \* O save me according to thy mercy;\      |
| 26 And they shall know how that this is thy hand, \* and that thou,   |
| LORD, hast done it.\                                                  |
| 27 Though they curse, yet bless thou; \* and let them be confounded   |
| that rise up against me; but let thy servant rejoice.\                |
| 28 Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame; \* and let them cover  |
| themselves with their own confusion, as with a cloak.\                |
| 29 As for me, I will give great thanks unto the LORD with my mouth,   |
| \* and praise him among the multitude;\                               |
| 30 For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, \* to save his   |
| soul from unrighteous judges.\                                        |
