| **Psalms 31. In te, Domine, speravi.**\                               |
| IN thee, O LORD, have I put my trust; let me never be put to          |
| confusion; \* deliver me in thy righteousness.\                       |
| 2 Bow down thine ear to me; \* make haste to deliver me.\             |
| 3 And be thou my strong rock, and house of defence, \* that thou      |
| mayest save me.\                                                      |
| 4 For thou art my strong rock, and my castle: \* be thou also my      |
| guide, and lead me for thy Name\'s sake.\                             |
| 5 Draw me out of the net that they have laid privily for me; \* for   |
| thou art my strength.\                                                |
| 6 Into thy hands I commend my spirit; \* for thou hast redeemed me, O |
| LORD, thou God of truth.\                                             |
| 7 I have hated them that hold of lying vanities, \* and my trust hath |
| been in the LORD.\                                                    |
| 8 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy; \* for thou hast           |
| considered my trouble, and hast known my soul in adversities.\        |
| 9 Thou hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy; \* but hast    |
| set my feet in a large room.\                                         |
| 10 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble, \* and mine eye   |
| is consumed for very heaviness; yea, my soul and my body.\            |
| 11 For my life is waxen old with heaviness, \* and my years with      |
| mourning.\                                                            |
| 12 My strength faileth me, because of mine iniquity, \* and my bones  |
| are consumed.\                                                        |
| 13 I became a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among   |
| my neighbours; \* and they of mine acquaintance were afraid of me;    |
| and they that did see me without, conveyed themselves from me.\       |
| 14 I am clean forgotten as a dead man out of mind; \* I am become     |
| like a broken vessel.\                                                |
| 15 For I have heard the blasphemy of the multitude, and fear is on    |
| every side; \* while they conspire together against me, and take      |
| their counsel to take away my life.\                                  |
| 16 But my hope hath been in thee, O LORD; \* I have said, Thou art my |
| God.\                                                                 |
| 17 My times are in thy hand; deliver me from the hand of mine         |
| enemies, \* and from them that persecute me.\                         |
| 18 Show thy servant the light of thy countenance, \* and save me for  |
| thy mercy\'s sake.\                                                   |
| 19 Let me not be confounded, O LORD, for I have called upon thee; \*  |
| let the ungodly be put to confusion, and be put to silence in the     |
| grave.\                                                               |
| 20 Let the lying lips be put to silence, \* which cruelly,            |
| disdainfully, and despitefully speak against the righteous.\          |
| 21 O how plentiful is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them  |
| that fear thee, \* and that thou hast prepared for them that put      |
| their trust in thee, even before the sons of men!\                    |
| 22 Thou shalt hide them in the covert of thine own presence from the  |
| plottings of men: \* thou shalt keep them secretly in thy tabernacle  |
| from the strife of tongues.\                                          |
| 23 Thanks be to the LORD; \* for he hath showed me marvellous great   |
| kindness in a strong city.\                                           |
| 24 But in my haste I said, \* I am cast out of the sight of thine     |
| eyes.\                                                                |
| 25 Nevertheless, thou heardest the voice of my prayer, \* when I      |
| cried unto thee.\                                                     |
| 26 O love the LORD, all ye his saints; \* for the LORD preserveth     |
| them that are faithful, and plenteously rewardeth the proud doer.\    |
| 27 Be strong, and he shall establish your heart, \* all ye that put   |
| your trust in the LORD.                                               |
