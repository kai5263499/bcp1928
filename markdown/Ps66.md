| **Psalm 66. Jubilate Deo.**\                                          |
| O BE joyful in God, all ye lands; \* sing praises unto the honour of  |
| his Name; make his praise to be glorious.\                            |
| 2 Say unto God, O how wonderful art thou in thy works! \* through the |
| greatness of thy power shall thine enemies bow down unto thee.\       |
| 3 For all the world shall worship thee, \* sing of thee, and praise   |
| thy Name.\                                                            |
| 4 O come hither, and behold the works of God; \* how wonderful he is  |
| in his doing toward the children of men.\                             |
| 5 He turned the sea into dry land, \* so that they went through the   |
| water on foot; there did we rejoice thereof.\                         |
| 6 He ruleth with his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: \*  |
| and such as will not believe shall not be able to exalt themselves.\  |
| 7 O praise our God, ye peoples, \* and make the voice of his praise   |
| to be heard;\                                                         |
| 8 Who holdeth our soul in life; \* and suffereth not our feet to      |
| slip.\                                                                |
| 9 For thou, O God, hast proved us; \* thou also hast tried us, like   |
| as silver is tried.\                                                  |
| 10 Thou broughtest us into the snare; \* and laidest trouble upon our |
| loins.\                                                               |
| 11 Thou sufferedst men to ride over our heads; \* we went through     |
| fire and water, and thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.\     |
| 12 I will go into thine house with burnt-offerings, and will pay thee |
| my vows, \* which I promised with my lips, and spake with my mouth,   |
| when I was in trouble.\                                               |
| 13 I will offer unto thee fat burnt-sacrifices, with the incense of   |
| rams; \* I will offer bullocks and goats.\                            |
| 14 O come hither, and hearken, all ye that fear God; \* and I will    |
| tell you what he hath done for my soul.\                              |
| 15 I called unto him with my mouth, \* and gave him praises with my   |
| tongue.\                                                              |
| 16 If I incline unto wickedness with mine heart, \* the Lord will not |
| hear me.\                                                             |
| 17 But God hath heard me; \* and considered the voice of my prayer.\  |
| 18 Praised be God, who hath not cast out my prayer, \* nor turned his |
| mercy from me.                                                        |
