| GRANT, O merciful God, that, as thine holy Apostle Saint James,       |
| leaving his father and all that he had, without delay was obedient    |
| unto the calling of thy Son Jesus Christ, and followed him; so we,    |
| forsaking all worldly and carnal affections, may be evermore ready to |

| Amen.\                                                                |

|                                                                       |
| IN these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch. And there    |
| stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the spirit that   |
| there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to  |
| pass in the days of Claudius Caesar. Then the disciples, every man    |
| according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren |
| which dwelt in Judaea: which also they did, and sent it to the elders |
| by the hands of Barnabas and Saul. Now about that time Herod the king |
| stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church. And he killed |
| James the brother of John with the sword. And because he saw it       |
| pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also.\           |
|                                                                       |
| The Gospel. St. Matthew xx. 20.                                       |
|                                                                       |
| THEN came to him the mother of Zebedee\'s children with her sons,     |
| worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him. And he said     |
| unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that these my two |
| sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left,   |
| in thy kingdom. But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. |
| Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be      |
| baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, |
| We are able. And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, |
| and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit  |
| on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall   |
| be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father. And when the   |
| ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against the two        |
| brethren. But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the  |
| princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that    |
| are great exercise authority upon them. But it shall not be so among  |
| you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; |
| and whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant: even  |
| as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister,    |
| and to give his life a ransom for many.                               |
|                                                                       |
