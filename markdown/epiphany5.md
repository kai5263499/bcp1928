| 1 Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there   |
| was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem-judah went   |
| to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two      |
| sons.\                                                                |
| 2 And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife     |
| Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites   |
| of Bethlehem-judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and       |
| continued there.\                                                     |
| 3 And Elimelech Naomi\'s husband died; and she was left, and her two  |
| sons.\                                                                |
| 4 And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one  |
| was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there     |
| about ten years.\                                                     |
| 5 And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was    |
| left of her two sons and her husband.\                                |
| 6 Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return     |
| from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab    |
| how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.\       |
| 7 Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her    |
| two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return     |
| unto the land of Judah.\                                              |
| 8 And Naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each to    |
| her mother\'s house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt  |
| with the dead, and with me.\                                          |
| 9 The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house  |
| of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, |
| and wept.\                                                            |
| 10 And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy   |
| people.\                                                              |
| 11 And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me?  |
| are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your         |
| husbands?\                                                            |
| 12 Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an |
| husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband    |
| also tonight, and should also bear sons;\                             |
| 13 Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for    |
| them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much |
| for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.\     |
| 14 And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed   |
| her mother-in-law; but Ruth clave unto her.\                          |
| 15 And she said, Behold, thy sister-in-law is gone back unto her      |
| people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister-in-law.\      |
| 16 And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from     |
| following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where    |
| thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy    |

| 36 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and   |

| the tares of the field.\                                              |

| the Son of man;\                                                      |
| 38 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the      |
| kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;\           |
| 39 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of  |
| the world; and the reapers are the angels.\                           |
| 40 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so     |
| shall it be in the end of this world.\                                |
| 41 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather  |
| out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do          |
| iniquity;\                                                            |

| and gnashing of teeth.\                                               |
| 43 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of  |
| their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.\                   |
| 44 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; |
| the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth |
| and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.\                 |
| 45 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking  |
| goodly pearls:\                                                       |
| 46 Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all |
| that he had, and bought it.\                                          |
| 47 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast     |
| into the sea, and gathered of every kind:\                            |
| 48 Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and     |
| gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.\               |
| 49 So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come      |
| forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,\                     |
| 50 And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be       |
| wailing and gnashing of teeth.\                                       |
| 51 Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They   |
| say unto him, Yea, Lord.\                                             |
