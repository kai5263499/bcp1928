| 18 The fear of the LORD is a crown of wisdom,making peace and perfect |
| health to flourish; both which are the gifts of God: and it enlargeth |
| their rejoicing that love him.\                                       |
| 19 Wisdom raineth down skill and knowledge of understanding, and      |
| exalteth them to honour that hold her fast.\                          |
| 20 The root of wisdom is to fear the LORD, and the branches thereof   |
| are long life.\                                                       |
| 21 The fear of the LORD driveth away sins: and where it is present,   |
| it turneth away wrath.\                                               |
| 22 A furious man cannot be justified; for the sway of his fury shall  |
| be his destruction.\                                                  |
| 23 A patient man will bear for a time, and afterward joy shall spring |
| up unto him.\                                                         |

| seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no             |

| shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the  |
| people, and they came out with one consent.\                          |
| 8 And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were     |

| 10 Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I  |
| shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests;  |
| and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.\       |

| 20 But showed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and      |

| liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.\                         |
| 1 And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they     |

| centurion of Augustus\' band.\                                        |

| 1 Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be   |
| king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto    |
| the voice of the words of the LORD.\                                  |
| 2 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to   |
| Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from     |
| Egypt.\                                                               |

| and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, |
| ox and sheep, camel and ass.\                                         |
| 4 And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, |
| two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.\         |
| 5 And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.\    |
| 6 And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among |
| the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye showed kindness  |
| to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the |
| Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.\                          |
| 7 And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to     |
| Shur, that is over against Egypt.\                                    |

| destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.\                 |
| []{#anchor320044}9 But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best  |

| 19 There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine |
| linen, and fared sumptuously every day:\                              |
| 20 And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at    |
| his gate, full of sores,\                                             |
| 21 And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich    |
| man\'s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.\           |
| 22 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the  |
| angels into Abraham\'s bosom: the rich man also died, and was         |
| buried;\                                                              |

| Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.\                          |
| 24 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send  |
| Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my  |
| tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.\                            |
| 25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime          |
| receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now |
| he is comforted, and thou art tormented.\                             |
| 26 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf      |
| fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot;        |
| neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.\            |
| 27 Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest    |
| send him to my father\'s house:\                                      |
| 28 For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they |
| also come into this place of torment.\                                |
| 29 Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them |
| hear them.\                                                           |

| the dead, they will repent.\                                          |

| 5 Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was   |
| Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a      |
| Benjamite;\                                                           |
| 6 Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which   |
| had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom               |
| Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.\                 |
| 7 And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle\'s daughter: |
| for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and      |
| beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took  |
| for his own daughter.\                                                |
| 8 So it came to pass, when the king\'s commandment and his decree was |
| heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the  |
| palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto    |
| the king\'s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.\     |
| 17 And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained    |
| grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he   |
| set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of      |
| Vashti.\                                                              |
| 18 Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his      |
| servants, even Esther\'s feast; and he made a release to the          |
| provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.\       |
| 19 And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then  |
| Mordecai sat in the king\'s gate.\                                    |
| 20 Esther had not yet shown her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai   |
| had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as  |
| when she was brought up with him.\                                    |
| 21 In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king\'s gate, two of the  |
| king\'s chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the     |
| door, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.\      |
| 22 And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the   |
| queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai\'s name.\    |
| 23 And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out;     |
| therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the  |
| book of the chronicles before the king.\                              |

| 27 But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and   |
| down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near  |
| to some country;\                                                     |
| 28 And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a |
| little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.\    |
| 29 Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four |
| anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.\                    |
| 30 And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they   |
| had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would |
| have cast anchors out of the foreship,\                               |
| 31 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide |
| in the ship, ye cannot be saved.\                                     |
| 32 Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall  |
| off.\                                                                 |
| 33 And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take    |
| meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and |
| continued fasting, having taken nothing.\                             |
| 34 Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your       |
| health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of      |
| you.\                                                                 |
| 35 And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God |
| in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.\ |
| 36 Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.\   |
| 37 And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen  |
| souls.\                                                               |
| 38 And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast  |
| out the wheat into the sea.\                                          |
| 39 And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a |
| certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it    |
| were possible, to thrust in the ship.\                                |
| 40 And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves  |
| unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoisted up the         |
| mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.\                         |
| 41 And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship     |
| aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but    |
| the hinderpart was broken with the violence of the waves.\            |
| 42 And the soldiers\' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of  |
| them should swim out, and escape.\                                    |
| 43 But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their      |
| purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast         |
| themselves first into the sea, and get to land:\                      |
| 44 And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the     |
| ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.\    |

| 11 It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is      |
| turned back from following me, and hath not performed my              |

| told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up  |
| a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.\  |
| 13 And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou   |
| of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.\           |
| 14 And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in   |
| mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?\                  |
| 15 And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the |
| people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice     |
| unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.\       |
| 16 Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the    |
| LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.\       |

| thee king over Israel?\                                               |

| didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?\   |
| 20 And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the     |
| LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought  |
| Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.\  |
| 21 But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the |
| things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto    |
| the LORD thy God in Gilgal.\                                          |
| 22 And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings |
| and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey  |
| is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.\       |

| Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all  |
| the princes that were with him.\                                      |
| 2 And all the king\'s servants, that were in the king\'s gate, bowed, |
| and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him.   |
| But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence.\                       |
| 3 Then the king\'s servants, which were in the king\'s gate, said     |
| unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king\'s commandment?\       |
| 4 Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he         |
| hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether         |
| Mordecai\'s matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a   |
| Jew.\                                                                 |
| 5 And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence,  |
| then was Haman full of wrath.\                                        |
| 6 And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had   |
| shown him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy   |
| all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus,     |
| even the people of Mordecai.\                                         |
| 7 In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year   |
| of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from |
| day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is,   |
| the month Adar.\                                                      |
| 8 And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people       |
| scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces  |
| of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither   |
| keep they the king\'s laws: therefore it is not for the king\'s       |
| profit to suffer them.\                                               |
| 9 If it please the king, let it be written that they may be           |
| destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands |
| of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the   |
| king\'s treasuries.\                                                  |

| the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews\' enemy.\                 |
| 11 And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the     |
| people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.\             |
| 12 Then were the king\'s scribes called on the thirteenth day of the  |
| first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had    |
| commanded unto the king\'s lieutenants, and to the governors that     |
| were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every  |
| province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after  |
| their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and     |

| 7 In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the       |

| 24 And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed  |
| the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the      |
| people, and obeyed their voice.\                                      |
| 25 Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, |
| that I may worship the LORD.\                                         |
| 26 And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou   |
| hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee   |
| from being king over Israel.\                                         |
| 27 And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt |
| of his mantle, and it rent.\                                          |
| 28 And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel |
| from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that   |
| is better than thou.\                                                 |
| 29 And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is |
| not a man, that he should repent.\                                    |
| 30 Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee,       |
| before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again     |
| with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.\                        |
| 31 So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.\  |
| 32 Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the       |
| Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely  |
| the bitterness of death is past.\                                     |

| 12 And they told to Mordecai Esther\'s words.\                        |
| 13 Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself   |
| that thou shalt escape in the king\'s house, more than all the Jews.\ |
| 14 For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall  |
| there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another      |
| place; but thou and thy father\'s house shall be destroyed: and who   |
| knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as       |

| this chain.\                                                          |
| 21 And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea  |
| concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came showed or      |
| spake any harm of thee.\                                              |
| 22 But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as           |
| concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.\ |
| 23 And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into |
| his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God,   |
| persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and   |
| out of the prophets, from morning till evening.\                      |
| 24 And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed  |
| not.\                                                                 |
| 25 And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after    |
| that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias    |
| the prophet unto our fathers,\                                        |
| 26 Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and   |
| shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:\     |
| []{#anchor373508}27 For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and  |
| their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest |
| they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and        |
| understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should    |
| heal them.\                                                           |
| 28 Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent  |
| unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.\                       |
| 29 And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great |
| reasoning among themselves.\                                          |
| 30 And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and         |
| received all that came in unto him,\                                  |
| 31 Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which      |
| concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding |
| him.\                                                                 |
