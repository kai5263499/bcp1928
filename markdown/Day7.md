| **Psalm 35. Judica, Domine.**\                                        |
| PLEAD thou my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me, \* and    |
| fight thou against them that fight against me.\                       |
| 2 Lay hand upon the shield and buckler, \* and stand up to help me.\  |
| 3 Bring forth the spear, and stop the way against them that pursue    |
| me: \* say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.\                         |
| 4 Let them be confounded, and put to shame, that seek after my soul;  |
| \* let them be turned back, and brought to confusion, that imagine    |
| mischief for me.\                                                     |
| 5 Let them be as the dust before the wind, \* and the angel of the    |
| LORD scattering them.\                                                |
| 6 Let their way be dark and slippery, \* and let the angel of the     |
| LORD pursue them.\                                                    |
| 7 For they have privily laid their net to destroy me without a cause; |
| \* yea, even without a cause have they made a pit for my soul.\       |
| 8 Let a sudden destruction come upon him unawares, and his net that   |
| he hath laid privily catch himself; \* that he may fall into his own  |
| mischief.\                                                            |
| 9 And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD; \* it shall rejoice in his |
| salvation.\                                                           |
| 10 All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, who           |
| deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him; \* yea, the  |
| poor, and him that is in misery, from him that spoileth him?\         |
| 11 False witnesses did rise up: \* they laid to my charge things that |
| I knew not.\                                                          |
| 12 They rewarded me evil for good, \* to the great discomfort of my   |
| soul.\                                                                |
| 13 Nevertheless, when they were sick, I put on sackcloth, and humbled |
| my soul with fasting; \* and my prayer shall turn into mine own       |
| bosom.\                                                               |
| 14 I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother; \* |
| I went heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.\                 |
| 15 But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves       |
| together; \* yea, the very abjects came together against me unawares, |
| making mouths at me, and ceased not.\                                 |
| 16 With the flatterers were busy mockers, \* who gnashed upon me with |
| their teeth.\                                                         |
| 17 Lord, how long wilt thou look upon this? \* O deliver my soul from |
| the calamities which they bring on me, and my darling from the        |
| lions.\                                                               |
| 18 So will I give thee thanks in the great congregation; \* I will    |
| praise thee among much people.\                                       |
| 19 O let not them that are mine enemies triumph over me ungodly; \*   |
| neither let them wink with their eyes, that hate me without a cause.\ |
| 20 And why? their communing is not for peace; \* but they imagine     |
| deceitful words against them that are quiet in the land.\             |
| 21 They gaped upon me with their mouths, and said, \* Fie on thee!    |
| fie on thee! we saw it with our eyes.\                                |
| 22 This thou hast seen, O LORD; \* hold not thy tongue then; go not   |
| far from me, O Lord.\                                                 |
| 23 Awake, and stand up to judge my quarrel; \* avenge thou my cause,  |
| my God and my Lord.\                                                  |
| 24 Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; \* and    |
| let them not triumph over me.\                                        |
| 25 Let them not say in their hearts, There! there! so would we have   |
| it; \* neither let them say, We have devoured him.\                   |
| 26 Let them be put to confusion and shame together, that rejoice at   |
| my trouble; \* let them be clothed with rebuke and dishonour, that    |
| boast themselves against me.\                                         |
| 27 Let them be glad and rejoice, that favour my righteous dealing; \* |
| yea, let them say alway, Blessed be the LORD, who hath pleasure in    |
| the prosperity of his servant.\                                       |
| 28 And as for my tongue, it shall be talking of thy righteousness, \* |
| and of thy praise, all the day long.\                                 |
| \                                                                     |
| **\                                                                   |
| Psalm 36. Dixit injustus.**\                                          |
| MY heart showeth me the wickedness of the ungodly, \* that there is   |
| no fear of God before his eyes.\                                      |
| 2 For he flattereth himself in his own sight, \* until his abominable |
| sin be found out.\                                                    |
| 3 The words of his mouth are unrighteous and full of deceit: \* he    |
| hath left off to behave himself wisely, and to do good.\              |
| 4 He imagineth mischief upon his bed, and hath set himself in no good |
| way; \* neither doth he abhor any thing that is evil.\                |
| 5 Thy mercy, O LORD, reacheth unto the\' heavens, \* and thy          |
| faithfulness unto the clouds.\                                        |
| 6 Thy righteousness standeth like the strong mountains: \* thy        |
| judgments are like the great deep.\                                   |
| 7 Thou, LORD, shalt save both man and beast: how excellent is thy     |
| mercy, O God! \* and the children of men shall put their trust under  |
| the shadow of thy wings.\                                             |
| 8 They shall be satisfied with the plenteousness of thy house; \* and |
| thou shalt give them drink of thy pleasures, as out of the river.\    |
| 9 For with thee is the well of life; \* and in thy light shall we see |
| light.\                                                               |
| 10 O continue forth thy loving-kindness unto them that know thee, \*  |
| and thy righteousness unto them that are true of heart.\              |
| 11 O let not the foot of pride come against me; \* and let not the    |
| hand of the ungodly cast me down.\                                    |
| 12 There are they fallen, all that work wickedness; \* they are cast  |
| down, and shall not be able to stand.\                                |

| **Psalm 37. Noli aemulari.**\                                         |
| FRET not thyself because of the ungodly; \* neither be thou envious   |
| against the evil doers.\                                              |
| 2 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, \* and be withered  |
| even as the green herb.\                                              |
| 3 Put thou thy trust in the LORD, and be doing good; \* dwell in the  |
| land, and verily thou shalt be fed.\                                  |
| 4 Delight thou in the LORD, \* and he shall give thee thy heart\'s    |
| desire.\                                                              |
| 5 Commit thy way unto the LORD, and put thy trust in him, \* and he   |
| shall bring it to pass.\                                              |
| 6 He shall make thy righteousness as clear as the light, \* and thy   |
| just dealing as the noon-day.\                                        |
| 7 Hold thee still in the LORD, and abide patiently upon him: \* but   |
| grieve not thyself at him whose way doth prosper, against the man     |
| that doeth after evil counsels.\                                      |
| 8 Leave off from wrath, and let go displeasure: \* fret not thyself,  |
| else shalt thou be moved to do evil.\                                 |
| 9 Wicked doers shall be rooted out; \* and they that patiently abide  |
| the LORD, those shall inherit the land.\                              |
| 10 Yet a little while, and the ungodly shall be clean gone: \* thou   |
| shalt look after his place, and he shall be away.\                    |
| 11 But the meek-spirited shall possess the earth, \* and shall be     |
| refreshed in the multitude of peace.\                                 |
| 12 The ungodly seeketh counsel against the just, \* and gnasheth upon |
| him with his teeth.\                                                  |
| 13 The Lord shall laugh him to-scorn; \* for he hath seen that his    |
| day is coming.\                                                       |
| 14 The ungodly have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, \*  |
| to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be upright in    |
| their ways.\                                                          |
| 15 Their sword shall go through their own heart, \* and their bow     |
| shall be broken.\                                                     |
| 16 A small thing that the righteous hath, \* is better than great     |
| riches of the ungodly.\                                               |
| 17 For the arms of the ungodly shall be broken, \* and the LORD       |
| upholdeth the righteous.\                                             |
| 18 The LORD knoweth the days of the godly; \* and their inheritance   |
| shall endure for ever.\                                               |
| 19 They shall not be confounded in the perilous time; \* and in the   |
| days of dearth they shall have enough.\                               |
| 20 As for the ungodly, they shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD |
| shall consume as the fat of lambs: \* yea, even as the smoke shall    |
| they consume away.\                                                   |
| 21 The ungodly borroweth, and payeth not again; \* but the righteous  |
| is merciful and liberal.\                                             |
| 22 Such as are blessed of God, shall possess the land; \* and they    |
| that are cursed of him, shall be rooted out.\                         |
| 23 The LORD ordereth a good man\'s going, \* and maketh his way       |
| acceptable to himself.\                                               |
| 24 Though he fall, he shall not be cast away; \* for the LORD         |
| upholdeth him with his hand.\                                         |
| 25 I have been young, and now am old; \* and yet saw I never the      |
| righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging their bread.\                |
| 26 The righteous is ever merciful, and lendeth; \* and his seed is    |
| blessed.\                                                             |
| 27 Flee from evil, and do the thing that is good; \* and dwell for    |
| evermore.\                                                            |
| 28 For the LORD loveth the thing that is right; \* he forsaketh not   |
| his that be godly, but they are preserved for ever.\                  |
| 29 The unrighteous shall be punished; \* as for the seed of the       |
| ungodly, it shall be rooted out.\                                     |
| 30 The righteous shall inherit the land, \* and dwell therein for     |
| ever.\                                                                |
| 31 The mouth of the righteous is exercised in wisdom, \* and his      |
| tongue will be talking of judgment.\                                  |
| 32 The law of his God is in his heart, \* and his goings shall not    |
| slide.\                                                               |
| 33 The ungodly watcheth the righteous, \* and seeketh occasion to     |
| slay him.\                                                            |
| 34 The LORD will not leave him in his hand, \* nor condemn him when   |
| he is judged.\                                                        |
| 35 Hope thou in the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall promote      |
| thee, that thou shalt possess the land: \* when the ungodly shall     |
| perish, thou shalt see it.\                                           |
| 36 I myself have seen the ungodly in great power, \* and flourishing  |
| like a green bay-tree.\                                               |
| 37 I went by, and lo, he was gone: \* I sought him, but his place     |
| could no where be found.\                                             |
| 38 Keep innocency, and take heed unto the thing that is right; \* for |
| that shall bring a man peace at the last.\                            |
| 39 As for the transgressors, they shall perish together; \* and the   |
| end of the ungodly is, they shall be rooted out at the last.\         |
| 40 But the salvation of the righteous cometh of the LORD; \* who is   |
| also their strength in the time of trouble.\                          |
| 41 And the LORD shall stand by them, and save them: \* he shall       |
| deliver them from the ungodly, and shall save them, because they put  |
| their trust in him.                                                   |
|                                                                       |
