| **Psalm 81. Exultate Deo.**\                                          |
| SING we merrily unto God our strength; \* make a cheerful noise unto  |
| the God of Jacob.\                                                    |
| 2 Take the psalm, bring hither the tabret, \* the merry harp with the |
| lute.\                                                                |
| 3 Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, \* even in the time appointed, |
| and upon our solemn feast-day.\                                       |
| 4 For this was made a statute for Israel, \* and a law of the God of  |
| Jacob.\                                                               |
| 5 This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, \* when he came out of  |
| the land of Egypt, and had heard a strange language.\                 |
| 6 I eased his shoulder from the burden, \* and his hands were         |
| delivered from making the pots.\                                      |
| 7 Thou calledst upon me in troubles, and I delivered thee; \* and     |
| heard thee what time as the storm fell upon thee.\                    |
| 8 I proved thee also \* at the waters of strife.\                     |
| 9 Hear, O my people; and I will assure thee, O Israel, \* if thou     |
| wilt hearken unto me,\                                                |
| 10 There shall no strange god be in thee, \* neither shalt thou       |
| worship any other god.\                                               |
| 11 I am the LORD thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt:  |
| \* open thy mouth wide, and I shall fill it.\                         |
| 12 But my people would not hear my voice; \* and Israel would not     |
| obey me;\                                                             |
| 13 So I gave them up unto their own hearts\' lusts, \* and let them   |
| follow their own imaginations.\                                       |
| 14 O that my people would have hearkened unto me! \* for if Israel    |
| had walked in my ways,\                                               |
| 15 I should soon have put down their enemies, \* and turned my hand   |
| against their adversaries.\                                           |
| 16 The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him;  |
| \* but their time should have endured for ever.\                      |
| 17 I would have fed them also with the finest wheatflour; \* and with |
| honey out of the stony rock would I have satisfied thee.              |
