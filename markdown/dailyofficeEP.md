| \                                                                     |

| DEARLY beloved brethren, the Scripture moveth us, in sundry places,   |
| to acknowledge and confess our manifold sins and wickedness; and that |
| we should not dissemble nor cloak them before the face of Almighty    |
| God our heavenly Father; but confess them with an humble, lowly,      |
| penitent, and obedient heart; to the end that we may obtain           |
| forgiveness of the same, by his infinite goodness and mercy. And      |
| although we ought, at all times, humbly to acknowledge our sins       |
| before God; yet ought we chiefly so to do, when we assemble and meet  |
| together to render thanks for the great benefits that we have         |
| received at his hands, to set forth his most worthy praise, to hear   |
| his most holy Word, and to ask those things which are requisite and   |
| necessary, as well for the body as the soul. Wherefore I pray and     |
| beseech you, as many as are here present, to accompany me with a pure |
| heart, and humble voice, unto the throne of the heavenly grace,       |
| saying\--\                                                            |
|                                                                       |
| **A General Confession.**                                             |
|                                                                       |
| ¶ To be said by the whole Congregation, after the Minister, all       |
| kneeling.                                                             |
|                                                                       |
| ALMIGHTY and most merciful Father; We have erred, and strayed from    |
| thy ways like lost sheep. We have followed too much the devices and   |
| desires of our own hearts. We have offended against thy holy laws. We |
| have left undone those things which we ought to have done; And we     |
| have done those things which we ought not to have done; And there is  |
| no health in us. But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us, miserable      |
| offenders. Spare thou those. O God, who confess their faults. Restore |
| thou those who are penitent; According to thy promises declared unto  |
| mankind In Christ Jesus our Lord. And grant, O most merciful Father,  |
| for his sake; That we may hereafter live a godly, righteous, and      |
| sober life, To the glory of thy holy Name. Amen.\                     |

| **The Declaration of Absolution, or Remission of Sins.**              |

| ¶ To be made by the Priest alone, standing; the People still          |
| kneeling.                                                             |

| ALMIGHTY God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who desireth not   |
| the death of a sinner, but rather that he may turn from his           |
| wickedness and live, hath given power, and commandment, to his        |
| Ministers, to declare and pronounce to his people, being penitent,    |
| the Absolution and Remission of their sins. He pardoneth and          |
| absolveth all those who truly repent, and unfeignedly believe his     |
| holy Gospel.\                                                         |

| Wherefore let us beseech him to grant us true repent- ance, and his   |
| Holy Spirit, that those things may please him which we do at this     |
| present; and that the rest of our life hereafter may be pure and      |
| holy; so that at the last we may come to his eternal joy; through     |
| Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.                                          |
|                                                                       |
| ¶ Or this.                                                            |

| The Almighty and merciful Lord grant you Absolu- tion and Remission   |
| of all your sins, true repentance, amendment of life, and the grace   |
| and consolation of his Holy Spirit. Amen.                             |
|                                                                       |
| ¶ Then the Minister shall kneel, and say the Lord\'s Prayer; the      |
| People still kneeling, and repeating it with him, both here, and      |
| wheresoever else it is used in Divine Service.\                       |

| who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, But deliver |
| us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, |

| And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord: Who was conceived by the   |
| Holy Ghost, Born of the Virgin Mary: Suffered under Pontius Pilate,   |
| Was crucified, dead, and buried: He descended into hell; The third    |
| day he rose again from the dead: He ascended into heaven, And sitteth |
| on the right hand of God the Father Almighty: From thence he shall    |
| come to judge the quick and the dead.\                                |
| I believe in the Holy Ghost: The holy Catholic Church; The Communion  |
| of Saints: The Forgiveness of sins: The Resurrection of the body: And |
| the Life everlasting. Amen.                                           |
