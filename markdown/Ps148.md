| **Psalm 148. Laudate Dominum.**\                                      |
| O PRAISE the LORD from the heavens: \* praise him in the heights.\    |
| 2 Praise him, all ye angels of his: \* praise him, all his host.\     |
| 3 Praise him, sun and moon: \* praise him, all ye stars and light.\   |
| 4 Praise him, all ye heavens, \* and ye waters that are above the     |
| heavens.\                                                             |
| 5 Let them praise the Name of the LORD: \* for he spake the word, and |
| they were made; he commanded, and they were created.\                 |
| 6 He hath made them fast for ever and ever: \* he hath given them a   |
| law which shall not be broken.\                                       |
| 7 Praise the LORD from the earth, \* ye dragons and all deeps;\       |
| 8 Fire and hail, snow and vapours, \* wind and storm, fulfilling his  |
| word;\                                                                |
| 9 Mountains and all hills; \* fruitful trees and all cedars;\         |
| 10 Beasts and all cattle; \* creeping things and flying fowls;\       |
| 11 Kings of the earth, and all peoples; \* princes, and all judges of |
| the world;\                                                           |
| 12 Young men and maidens, old men and children, praise the Name of    |
| the LORD: \* for his Name only is excellent, and his praise above     |
| heaven and earth.\                                                    |
| 13 He shall exalt the horn of his people: all his saints shall praise |
| him; \* even the children of Israel, even the people that serveth     |
| him.                                                                  |
