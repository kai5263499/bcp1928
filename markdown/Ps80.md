| **Psalm 80. Qui regis Israel.**\                                      |
| HEAR, O thou Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a      |
| flock; \* show thyself also, thou that sittest upon the Cherubim.\    |
| 2 Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, \* stir up thy strength,    |
| and come and help us.\                                                |
| 3 Turn us again, O God; \* show the light of thy countenance, and we  |
| shall be whole.\                                                      |
| 4 O LORD God of hosts, \* how long wilt thou be angry with thy people |
| that prayeth?\                                                        |
| 5 Thou feedest them with the bread of tears, \* and givest them       |
| plenteousness of tears to drink.\                                     |
| 6 Thou hast made us a very strife unto our neighbours, \* and our     |
| enemies laugh us to scorn.\                                           |
| 7 Turn us again, thou God of hosts; \* show the light of thy          |
| countenance, and we shall be whole.\                                  |
| 8 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt; \* thou hast cast out the    |
| heathen, and planted it.\                                             |
| 9 Thou madest room for it; \* and when it had taken root, it filled   |
| the land.\                                                            |
| 10 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, \* and the boughs    |
| thereof were like the goodly cedar-trees.\                            |
| 11 She stretched out her branches unto the sea, \* and her boughs     |
| unto the River.\                                                      |
| 12 Why hast thou then broken down her hedge, \* that all they that go |
| by pluck off her grapes?\                                             |
| 13 The wild boar out of the wood doth root it up, \* and the wild     |
| beasts of the field devour it.\                                       |
| 14 Turn thee again, thou God of hosts, look down from heaven, \*      |
| behold, and visit this vine;\                                         |
| 15 And the place of the vineyard that thy right hand hath planted, \* |
| and the branch that thou madest so strong for thyself.\               |
| 16 It is burnt with fire, and cut down; \* and they shall perish at   |
| the rebuke of thy countenance.\                                       |
| 17 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, \* and upon the    |
| son of man, whom thou madest so strong for thine own self.\           |
| 18 And so will not we go back from thee: \* O let us live, and we     |
| shall call upon thy Name.\                                            |
| 19 Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts; \* show the light of thy       |
| countenance, and we shall be whole.                                   |
