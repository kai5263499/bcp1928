| **Psalm 121. Levavi oculos.**\                                        |
| I WILL lift up mine eyes unto the hills; \* from whence cometh my     |
| help?\                                                                |
| 2 My help cometh even from the LORD, \* who hath made heaven and      |
| earth.\                                                               |
| 3 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved; \* and he that keepeth     |
| thee will not sleep.\                                                 |
| 4 Behold, he that keepeth Israel \* shall neither slumber nor sleep.\ |
| 5 The LORD himself is thy keeper; \* the LORD is thy defence upon thy |
| right hand;\                                                          |
| 6 So that the sun shall not burn thee by day, \* neither the moon by  |
| night.\                                                               |
| 7 The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil; \* yea, it is even he   |
| that shall keep thy soul.\                                            |
| 8 The LORD shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming in, \* from   |
| this time forth for evermore.                                         |
