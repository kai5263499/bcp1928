**\
Psalm 1. Beatus vir qui non abiit.**\
BLESSED is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly,
nor stood in the way of sinners, \* and hath not sat in the seat of the
scornful.\
2 But his delight is in the law of the LORD; \* and in his law will he
exercise himself day and night.\
3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the water-side, \* that will
bring forth his fruit in due season.\
4 His leaf also shall not wither; \* and look, whatsoever he doeth, it
shall prosper.\
5 As for the ungodly, it is not so with them; \* but they are like the
chaff, which the wind scattereth away from the face of the earth.\
6 Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stand in the judgment, \*
neither the sinners in the congregation of the righteous.\
7 But the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous; \* and the way of the
ungodly shall perish.\

**Psalm 2. Quare fremuerunt gentes?**\
WHY do the heathen so furiously rage together? \* and why do the people
imagine a vain thing?\
2 The kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take counsel together
\* against the LORD, and against his Anointed:\
3 Let us break their bonds asunder, \* and cast away their cords from
us.\
4 He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh them to scorn: \* the Lord
shall have them in derision.\
5 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, \* and vex them in his
sore displeasure:\
6 Yet have I set my King \* upon my holy hill of Sion.\
7 I will rehearse the decree; \* the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my
Son, this day have I begotten thee.\
8 Desire of me, and I shall give thee the nations for thine inheritance,
\* and the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession.\
9 Thou shalt bruise them with a rod of iron, \* and break them in pieces
like a potter\'s vessel.\
10 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings; \* be instructed, ye that are
judges of the earth.\
11 Serve the LORD in fear, \* and rejoice unto him with reverence.\
12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and so ye perish from the right way,
if his wrath be kindled, yea but a little. \* Blessed are all they that
put their trust in him.\

**Psalm 3. Domine, quid multiplicati?**\
LORD, how are they increased that trouble me! \* many are they that rise
against me.\
2 Many one there be that say of my soul, \* There is no help for him in
his God.\
3 But thou, O LORD, art my defender; \* thou art my worship, and the
lifter up of my head.\
4 I did call upon the LORD with my voice, \* and he heard me out of his
holy hill.\
5 I laid me down and slept, and rose up again; \* for the LORD sustained
me.\
6 I will not be afraid for ten thousands of the people, \* that have set
themselves against me round about.\
7 UP, LORD, and help me, O my God, \* for thou smitest all mine enemies
upon the cheek-bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.\
8 Salvation belongeth unto the LORD; \* and thy blessing is upon thy
people.\

**Psalm 4. Cum invocarem.**\
HEAR me when I call, O God of my righteousness: \* thou hast set me at
liberty when I was in trouble; have mercy upon me, and hearken unto my
prayer.\
2 O ye sons of men, how long will ye blaspheme mine honour, \* and have
such pleasure in vanity, and seek after falsehood?\
3 Know this also, that the LORD hath chosen to himself the man that is
godly; \* when I call upon the LORD he will hear me.\
4 Stand in awe, and sin not; \* commune with your own heart, and in your
chamber, and be still.\
5 Offer the sacrifice of righteousness, \* and put your trust in the
LORD.\
6 There be many that say, \* Who will show us any good?\
7 LORD, lift thou up\* the light of thy countenance upon us.\
8 Thou hast put gladness in my heart; \* yea, more than when their corn
and wine and oil increase.\
9 I will lay me down in peace, and take my rest; \* for it is thou,
LORD, only, that makest me dwell in safety.\

**Psalm 5. Verba mea auribus.**\
PONDER my words, O LORD, \* consider my meditation.\
2 O hearken thou unto the voice of my calling, my King and my God: \*
for unto thee will I make my prayer.\
3 My voice shalt thou hear betimes, O LORD; \* early in the morning will
I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.\
4 For thou art the God that hast no pleasure in wickedness; \* neither
shall any evil dwell with thee.\
5 Such as be foolish shall not stand in thy sight; \* for thou hatest
all them that work iniquity.\
6 Thou shalt destroy them that speak lies: \* the LORD will abhor both
the blood-thirsty and deceitful man.\
7 But as for me, in the multitude of thy mercy I will come into thine
house; \* and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.\
8 Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness, because of mine enemies; \*
make thy way plain before my face.\
9 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; \* their inward parts are
very wickedness.\
10 Their throat is an open sepulchre; \* they flatter with their
tongue.\
11 Destroy thou them, O God; let them perish through their own
imaginations; \* cast them out in the multitude of their ungodliness;
for they have rebelled against thee.\
12 And let all them that put their trust in thee rejoice: \* they shall
ever be giving of thanks, because thou defendest them; they that love
thy Name shall be joyful in thee;\
13 For thou, LORD, wilt give thy blessing unto the righteous, \* and
with thy favourable kindness wilt thou defend him as with a shield.
