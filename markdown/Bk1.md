The Psalter or Psalms of David

**BOOK I.**\
\
The First Day.\
\
Morning Prayer.

**Psalm 1. Beatus vir qui non abiit.**\
BLESSED is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly,
nor stood in the way of sinners, \* and hath not sat in the seat of the
scornful.\
2 But his delight is in the law of the LORD; \* and in his law will he
exercise himself day and night.\
3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the water-side, \* that will
bring forth his fruit in due season.\
4 His leaf also shall not wither; \* and look, whatsoever he doeth, it
shall prosper.\
5 As for the ungodly, it is not so with them; \* but they are like the
chaff, which the wind scattereth away from the face of the earth.\
6 Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stand in the judgment, \*
neither the sinners in the congregation of the righteous.\
7 But the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous; \* and the way of the
ungodly shall perish.\
\
**\
Psalm 2. Quare fremuerunt gentes?**\
WHY do the heathen so furiously rage together? \* and why do the people
imagine a vain thing?\
2 The kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take counsel together
\* against the LORD, and against his Anointed:\
3 Let us break their bonds asunder, \* and cast away their cords from
us.\
4 He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh them to scorn: \* the Lord
shall have them in derision.\
5 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, \* and vex them in his
sore displeasure:\
6 Yet have I set my King \* upon my holy hill of Sion.\
7 I will rehearse the decree; \* the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my
Son, this day have I begotten thee.\
8 Desire of me, and I shall give thee the nations for thine inheritance,
\* and the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession.\
9 Thou shalt bruise them with a rod of iron, \* and break them in pieces
like a potter\'s vessel.\
10 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings; \* be instructed, ye that are
judges of the earth.\
11 Serve the LORD in fear, \* and rejoice unto him with reverence.\
12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and so ye perish from the right way,
if his wrath be kindled, yea but a little. \* Blessed are all they that
put their trust in him.\
\
**\
Psalm 3. Domine, quid multiplicati?**\
LORD, how are they increased that trouble me! \* many are they that rise
against me.\
2 Many one there be that say of my soul, \* There is no help for him in
his God.\
3 But thou, O LORD, art my defender; \* thou art my worship, and the
lifter up of my head.\
4 I did call upon the LORD with my voice, \* and he heard me out of his
holy hill.\
5 I laid me down and slept, and rose up again; \* for the LORD sustained
me.\
6 I will not be afraid for ten thousands of the people, \* that have set
themselves against me round about.\
7 UP, LORD, and help me, O my God, \* for thou smitest all mine enemies
upon the cheek-bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.\
8 Salvation belongeth unto the LORD; \* and thy blessing is upon thy
people.\
\
**\
Psalm 4. Cum invocarem.**\
HEAR me when I call, O God of my righteousness: \* thou hast set me at
liberty when I was in trouble; have mercy upon me, and hearken unto my
prayer.\
2 O ye sons of men, how long will ye blaspheme mine honour, \* and have
such pleasure in vanity, and seek after falsehood?\
3 Know this also, that the LORD hath chosen to himself the man that is
godly; \* when I call upon the LORD he will hear me.\
4 Stand in awe, and sin not; \* commune with your own heart, and in your
chamber, and be still.\
5 Offer the sacrifice of righteousness, \* and put your trust in the
LORD.\
6 There be many that say, \* Who will show us any good?\
7 LORD, lift thou up\* the light of thy countenance upon us.\
8 Thou hast put gladness in my heart; \* yea, more than when their corn
and wine and oil increase.\
9 I will lay me down in peace, and take my rest; \* for it is thou,
LORD, only, that makest me dwell in safety.\
\
**\
Psalm 5. Verba mea auribus.**\
PONDER my words, O LORD, \* consider my meditation.\
2 O hearken thou unto the voice of my calling, my King and my God: \*
for unto thee will I make my prayer.\
3 My voice shalt thou hear betimes, O LORD; \* early in the morning will
I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.\
4 For thou art the God that hast no pleasure in wickedness; \* neither
shall any evil dwell with thee.\
5 Such as be foolish shall not stand in thy sight; \* for thou hatest
all them that work iniquity.\
6 Thou shalt destroy them that speak lies: \* the LORD will abhor both
the blood-thirsty and deceitful man.\
7 But as for me, in the multitude of thy mercy I will come into thine
house; \* and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.\
8 Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness, because of mine enemies; \*
make thy way plain before my face.\
9 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; \* their inward parts are
very wickedness.\
10 Their throat is an open sepulchre; \* they flatter with their
tongue.\
11 Destroy thou them, O God; let them perish through their own
imaginations; \* cast them out in the multitude of their ungodliness;
for they have rebelled against thee.\
12 And let all them that put their trust in thee rejoice: \* they shall
ever be giving of thanks, because thou defendest them; they that love
thy Name shall be joyful in thee;\
13 For thou, LORD, wilt give thy blessing unto the righteous, \* and
with thy favourable kindness wilt thou defend him as with a shield.\
\

Evening Prayer.

**Psalm 6. Domine, ne in furore.**\
O LORD, rebuke me not in thine indignation, \* neither chasten me in thy
displeasure.\
2 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am weak; \* O LORD, heal me, for my
bones are vexed.\
3 My soul also is sore troubled: \* but, LORD, how long wilt thou punish
me?\
4 Turn thee, O LORD, and deliver my soul; \* O save me, for thy mercy\'s
sake.\
5 For in death no man remembereth thee; \* and who will give thee thanks
in the pit?\
6 I am weary of my groaning; \* every night wash I my bed, and water my
couch with my tears.\
7 My beauty is gone for very trouble, \* and worn away because of all
mine enemies.\
8 Away from me, all ye that work iniquity; \* for the LORD hath heard
the voice of my weeping.\
9 The LORD hath heard my petition; \* the LORD will receive my prayer.\
10 All mine enemies shall be confounded, and sore vexed; \* they shall
be turned back, and put to shame suddenly.\
\
**\
Psalm 7. Domine, Deus meus.**\
O LORD my God, in thee have I put my trust: \* save me from all them
that persecute me, and deliver me;\
2 Lest he devour my soul like a lion, and tear it in pieces, \* while
there is none to help.\
3 O LORD my God, if I have done any such thing; \* or if there be any
wickedness in my hands;\
4 If I have rewarded evil unto him that dealt friendly with me; \* (yea,
I have delivered him that without any cause is mine enemy;)\
5 Then let mine enemy persecute my soul, and take me; \* yea, let him
tread my life down upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust.\
6 Stand up, O LORD, in thy wrath, and lift up thyself, because of the
indignation of mine enemies; \* arise up for me in the judgment that
thou hast commanded.\
7 And so shall the congregation of the peoples come about thee: \* for
their sakes therefore lift up thyself again.\
8 The LORD shall judge the peoples: give sentence with me, O LORD, \*
according to my righteousness, and according to the innocency that is in
me.\
9 O let the wickedness of the ungodly come to an end; \* but guide thou
the just.\
10 For the righteous God \* trieth the very hearts and reins.\
11 My help cometh of God, \* who preserveth them that are true of
heart.\
12 God is a righteous Judge, strong, and patient; \* and God is provoked
every day.\
13 If a man will not turn, he will whet his sword; \* he hath bent his
bow, and made it ready.\
14 He hath prepared for him the instruments of death; \* he ordaineth
his arrows against the persecutors.\
15 Behold, the ungodly travaileth with iniquity; \* he hath conceived
mischief, and brought forth falsehood.\
16 He hath graven and digged up a pit, \* and is fallen himself into the
destruction that he made for other.\
17 For his travail shall come upon his own head, \* and his wickedness
shall fall on his own pate.\
18 I will give thanks unto the LORD, according to his righteousness; \*
and I will praise the Name of the LORD Most High.\
\
**\
Psalm 8. Domine, Dominus noster.**\
O LORD our Governor, how excellent is thy Name in all the world; \* thou
that hast set thy glory above the heavens!\
2 Out of the mouth of very babes and sucklings hast thou ordained
strength, because of thine enemies, \* that thou mightest still the
enemy and the avenger.\
3 When I consider thy heavens, even the work of thy fingers; \* the moon
and the stars which thou hast ordained;\
4 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? \* and the son of man, that
thou visitest him?\
5 Thou madest him lower than the angels, \* to crown him with glory and
worship.\
6 Thou makest him to have dominion of the works of thy hands; \* and
thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet:\
7 All sheep and oxen; \* yea, and the beasts of the field;\
8 The fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea; \* and whatsoever
walketh through the paths of the seas.\
9 O LORD our Governor, \* how excellent is thy Name in all the world!\
\

The Second Day.\
\
Morning Prayer.

**Psalm 9. Confitebor tibi.**\
I WILL give thanks unto thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; \* I will
speak of all thy marvellous works.\
2 I will be glad and rejoice in thee; \* yea, my songs will I make of
thy Name, O thou Most Highest.\
3 While mine enemies are driven back, \* they shall fall and perish at
thy presence.\
4 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; \* thou art set in the
throne that judgest right.\
5 Thou hast rebuked the heathen, and destroyed the ungodly; \* thou hast
put out their name for ever and ever.\
6 O thou enemy, thy destructions are come to a perpetual end; \* even as
the cities which thou hast destroyed, whose memorial is perished with
them.\
7 But the LORD shall endure for ever; \* he hath also prepared his seat
for judgment.\
8 For he shall judge the world in righteousness, \* and minister true
judgment unto the people.\
9 The LORD also will be a defence for the oppressed, \* even a refuge in
due time of trouble.\
10 And they that know thy Name will put their trust in thee; \* for
thou, LORD, hast never failed them that seek thee.\
11 O praise the LORD which dwelleth in Sion; \* show the people of his
doings.\
12 For when he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them, \* and
forgetteth not the complaint of the poor.\
13 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider the trouble which I suffer of
them that hate me, \* thou that liftest me up from the gates of death;\
14 That I may show all thy praises within the gates of the daughter of
Sion: \* I will rejoice in thy salvation.\
15 The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made; \* in the same
net which they hid privily is their foot taken.\
16 The LORD is known to execute judgment; \* the ungodly is trapped in
the work of his own hands.\
17 The wicked shall be turned to destruction, \* and all the people that
forget God.\
18 For the poor shall not alway be forgotten; \* the patient abiding of
the meek shall not perish for ever.\
19 UP, LORD, and let not man have the upper hand; \* let the heathen be
judged in thy sight.\
20 Put them in fear, O LORD, \* that the heathen may know themselves to
be but men.\
\
**\
Psalm 10. Ut quid, Domine ?**\
WHY standest thou so far off, O LORD, \* and hidest thy face in the
needful time of trouble?\
2 The ungodly, for his own lust, doth persecute the poor: \* let them be
taken in the crafty wiliness that they have imagined.\
3 For the ungodly hath made boast of his own heart\'s desire, \* and
speaketh good of the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.\
4 The ungodly is so proud, that he careth not for God, \* neither is God
in all his thoughts.\
5 His ways are alway grievous; \* thy judgments are far above out of his
sight, and therefore defieth he all his enemies.\
6 For he hath said in his heart, Tush, I shall never be cast down, \*
there shall no harm happen unto me.\
7 His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and fraud; \* under his tongue
is ungodliness and vanity.\
8 He sitteth lurking in the thievish corners of the streets, \* and
privily in his lurking dens doth he murder the innocent; his eyes are
set against the poor.\
9 For he lieth waiting secretly; even as a lion lurketh he in his den,
\* that he may ravish the poor.\
10 He doth ravish the poor, \* when he getteth him into his net.\
11 He falleth down, and humbleth himself, \* that the congregation of
the poor may fall into the hands of his captains.\
12 He hath said in his heart, Tush, God hath forgotten; \* he hideth
away his face, and he will never see it.\
13 Arise, O LORD God, and lift up thine hand; \* forget not the poor.\
14 Wherefore should the wicked blaspheme God, \* while he doth say in
his heart, Tush, thou God carest not for it?\
15 Surely thou hast seen it; \* for thou beholdest ungodliness and
wrong, that thou mayest take the matter into thy hand.\
16 The poor committeth himself unto thee; \* for thou art the helper of
the friendless.\
17 Break thou the power of the ungodly and malicious; \* search out his
ungodliness, until thou find none.\
18 The LORD is King for ever and ever, \* and the heathen are perished
out of the land.\
19 LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the poor; \* thou preparest their
heart, and thine ear hearkeneth;\
20 To help the fatherless and poor unto their right, \* that the man of
the earth be no more exalted against them.\
**\
Psalm 11. In Domino confido.**\
IN the LORD put I my trust; \* how say ye then to my soul, that she
should flee as a bird unto the hill?\
2 For lo, the ungodly bend their bow, and make ready their arrows within
the quiver, \* that they may privily shoot at them which are true of
heart.\
3 If the foundations be destroyed, \* what can the righteous do?\
4 The LORD is in his holy temple; \* the LORD\'S seat is in heaven.\
5 His eyes consider the poor, \* and his eyelids try the children of
men.\
6 The LORD approveth the righteous: \* but the ungodly, and him that
delighteth in wickedness, doth his soul abhor.\
7 Upon the ungodly he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, storm and
tempest: \* this shall be their portion to drink.\
8 For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; \* his countenance will
behold the thing that is just.\

Evening Prayer.

**Psalm 12. Salvum me fac.**\
HELP me, LORD, for there is not one godly man left; \* for the faithful
are minished from among the children of men.\
2 They talk of vanity every one with his neighbour; \* they do but
flatter with their lips, and dissemble in their double heart.\
3 The LORD shall root out all deceitful lips, \* and the tongue that
speaketh proud things;\
4 Which have said, With our tongue will we prevail; \* we are they that
ought to speak; who is lord over us?\
5 Now, for the comfortless troubles\' sake of the needy, \* and because
of the deep sighing of the poor,\
6 I will up, saith the LORD; \* and will help every one from him that
swelleth against him, and will set him at rest.\
7 The words of the LORD are pure words; \* even as the silver which from
the earth is tried, and purified seven times in the fire.\
8 Thou shalt keep them, O LORD; \* thou shalt preserve them from this
generation for ever.\
9 The ungodly walk on every side: \* when they are exalted, the children
of men are put to rebuke.\
**\
Psalm 13. Usquequo, Domine?**\
HOW long wilt thou forget me, O LORD; for ever? \* how long wilt thou
hide thy face from me?\
2 How long shall I seek counsel in my soul, and be so vexed in my heart?
\* how long shall mine enemy triumph over me?\
3 Consider, and hear me, O LORD my God; \* lighten mine eyes, that I
sleep not in death;\
4 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him: \* for if I be cast
down, they that trouble me will rejoice at it.\
5 But my trust is in thy mercy, \* and my heart is joyful in thy
salvation.\
6 I will sing of the LORD, because he hath dealt so lovingly with me; \*
yea, I will praise the Name of the Lord Most Highest.\
\
**\
Psalm 14. Dixit insipiens.**\
THE fool hath said in his heart, \* There is no God.\
2 They are corrupt, and become abominable in their doings; \* there is
none that doeth good, no not one.\
3 The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, \* to see
if there were any that would understand, and seek after God.\
4 But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become
abominable; \* there is none that doeth good, no not one.\
5 Have they no knowledge, that they are all such workers of mischief, \*
eating up my people as it were bread, and call not upon the LORD?\
6 There were they brought in great fear, even where no fear was; \* for
God is in the generation of the righteous.\
7 As for you, ye have made a mock at the counsel of the poor; \* because
he putteth his trust in the LORD.\
8 Who shall give salvation unto Israel out of Sion? \* When the LORD
turneth the captivity of his people, then shall Jacob rejoice, and
Israel shall be glad.\

The Third Day.\
Morning Prayer.

**Psalm 15. Domine, quis habitabit?**\
LORD, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? \* or who shall rest upon thy
holy hill?\
2 Even he that leadeth an uncorrupt life, \* and doeth the thing which
is right, and speaketh the truth from his heart.\
3 He that hath used no deceit in his tongue, nor done evil to his
neighbour, \* and hath not slandered his neighbour.\
4 He that setteth not by himself, but is lowly in his own eyes, \* and
maketh much of them that fear the LORD.\
5 He that sweareth unto his neighbour, and disappointeth him not, \*
though it were to his own hindrance.\
6 He that hath not given his money upon usury, \* nor taken reward
against the innocent.\
7 Whoso doeth these things \* shall never fall.\
\
**\
Psalm 16. Conserva me, Domine.**\
PRESERVE me, O God; \* for in thee have I put my trust.\
2 O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, \* Thou art my God; I have no
good like unto thee.\
3 All my delight is upon the saints that are in the earth, \* and upon
such as excel in virtue.\
4 But they that run after another god \* shall have great trouble.\
5 Their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, \* neither make
mention of their names within my lips.\
6 The LORD himself is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup; \*
thou shalt maintain my lot.\
7 The lot is fallen unto me in a fair ground; \* yea, I have a goodly
heritage.\
8 I will thank the LORD for giving me warning; \* my reins also chasten
me in the night season.\
9 I have set the LORD alway before me; \* for he is on my right hand,
therefore I shall not fall.\
10 Wherefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: \* my flesh also
shall rest in hope.\
11 For why? thou shalt not leave my soul in hell; \* neither shalt thou
suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.\
12 Thou shalt show me the path of life: in thy presence is the fulness
of joy, \* and at thy right hand there is pleasure for evermore.\
\
**\
Psalm 17. Exaudi, Domine.**\
HEAR the right, O LORD, consider my complaint, \* and hearken unto my
prayer, that goeth not out-of feigned lips.\
2 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; \* and let thine eyes
look upon the thing that is equal.\
3 Thou hast proved and visited mine heart in the night season; thou hast
tried me, and shalt find no wickedness in me; \* for I am utterly
purposed that my mouth shall not offend.\
4 As for the works of men, \* by the word of thy lips I have kept me
from the ways of the destroyer.\
5 O hold thou up my goings in thy paths, \* that my footsteps slip not.\
6 I have called upon thee, O God, for thou shalt hear me: \* incline
thine ear to me, and hearken unto my words.\
7 Show thy marvellous loving-kindness, thou that art the Saviour of them
which put their trust in thee, \* from such as resist thy right hand.\
8 Keep me as the apple of an eye; \* hide me under the shadow of thy
wings,\
9 From the ungodly, that trouble me; \* mine enemies compass me round
about, to take away my soul.\
10 They are inclosed in their own fat, \* and their mouth speaketh proud
things.\
11 They lie waiting in our way on every side, \* watching to cast us
down to the ground;\
12 Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, \* and as it were a
lion\'s whelp lurking in secret places.\
13 Up, LORD, disappoint him, and cast him down; \* deliver my soul from
the ungodly, by thine own sword;\
14 Yea, by thy hand, O LORD; from the men of the evil world; \* which
have their portion in this life, whose bellies thou fillest with thy hid
treasure.\
15 They have children at their desire, \* and leave the rest of their
substance for their babes.\
16 But as for me, I shall behold thy presence in righteousness; \* and
when I awake up after thy likeness, I shall be satisfied.\

Evening Prayer.

**Psalm 18. Diligam te, Domine.**\
I WILL love thee, O LORD, my strength. \* The LORD is my stony rock, and
my defence;\
2 My Saviour, my God, and my might, in whom I will trust; \* my buckler,
the horn also of my salvation, and my refuge.\
3 I will call upon the LORD, which is worthy to be praised; \* so shall
I be safe from mine enemies.\
4 The sorrows of death compassed me, \* and the overflowings of
ungodliness made me afraid.\
5 The pains of hell came about me; \* the snares of death overtook me.\
6 In my trouble I called upon the LORD, \* and complained unto my God:\
7 So he heard my voice out of his holy temple, \* and my complaint came
before him; it entered even into his ears.\
8 The earth trembled and quaked, \* the very foundations also of the
hills shook, and were removed, because he was wroth.\
9 There went a smoke out in his presence, \* and a consuming fire out of
his mouth, so that coals were kindled at it.\
10 He bowed the heavens also, and came down, \* and it was dark under
his feet.\
11 He rode upon the Cherubim, and did fly; \* he came flying upon the
wings of the wind.\
12 He made darkness his secret place, \* his pavilion round about him
with dark water, and thick clouds to cover him.\
13 At the brightness of his presence his clouds removed; \* hailstones
and coals of fire.\
14 The LORD also thundered out of heaven, and the Highest gave his
thunder; \* hailstones and coals of fire.\
15 He sent out his arrows, and scattered them; \* he cast forth
lightnings, and destroyed them.\
16 The springs of waters were seen, and the foundations of the round
world were discovered, \* at thy chiding, O LORD, at the blasting of the
breath of thy displeasure.\
17 He sent down from on high to fetch me, \* and took me out of many
waters.\
18 He delivered me from my strongest enemy, and from them which hate me;
\* for they were too mighty for me.\
19 They came upon me in the day of my trouble; \* but the LORD was my
upholder.\
20 He brought me forth also into a place of liberty; \* he brought me
forth, even because he had a favour unto me.\
21 The LORD rewarded me after my righteous dealing, \* according to the
cleanness of my hands did he recompense me.\
22 Because I have kept the ways of the LORD, \* and have not forsaken my
God, as the wicked doth.\
23 For I have an eye unto all his laws, \* and will not cast out his
commandments from me.\
24 I was also uncorrupt before him, \* and eschewed mine own
wickedness.\
25 Therefore the LORD rewarded me after my righteous dealing, \* and
according unto the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.\
26 With the holy thou shalt be holy, \* and with a perfect man thou
shalt be perfect.\
27 With the clean thou shalt be clean, \* and with the froward thou
shalt be froward.\
28 For thou shalt save the people that are in adversity, and shalt bring
down the high looks of the proud.\
29 Thou also shalt light my candle; \* the LORD my God shall make my
darkness to be light.\
30 For in thee I shall discomfit an host of men, \* and with the help of
my God I shall leap over the wall.\
31 The way of God is an undefiled way: \* the word of the LORD also is
tried in the fire; he is the defender of all them that put their trust
in him.\
32 For who is God, but the LORD? \* or who hath any strength, except our
God?\
33 It is God that girdeth me with strength of war, \* and maketh my way
perfect.\
34 He maketh my feet like harts\' feet, \* and setteth me up on high.\
35 He teacheth mine hands to fight, \* and mine arms shall bend even a
bow of steel.\
36 Thou hast given me the defence of thy salvation; \* thy right hand
also shall hold me up, and thy loving correction shall make me great.\
37 Thou shalt make room enough under me for to go, \* that my footsteps
shall not slide.\
38 I will follow upon mine enemies, and overtake them; \* neither will I
turn again till I have destroyed them.\
39 I will smite them, that they shall not be able to stand, \* but fall
under my feet.\
40 Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle; \* thou shalt
throw down mine enemies under me.\
41 Thou hast made mine enemies also to turn their backs upon me, \* and
I shall destroy them that hate me.\
42 They shall cry, but there shall be none to help them; \* yea, even
unto the LORD shall they cry, but he shall not hear them.\
43 I will beat them as small as the dust before the wind: \* I will cast
them out as the clay in the streets.\
44 Thou shalt deliver me from the strivings of the people, \* and thou
shalt make me the head of the nations; a people whom I have not known
shall serve me.\
45 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me; \* the strangers
shall feign obedience unto me.\
46 The strangers shall fail, \* and come trembling out of their
strongholds.\
47 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my strong helper, \* and praised be
the God of my salvation;\
48 Even the God that seeth that I be avenged, \* and subdueth the people
unto me.\
49 It is he that delivereth me from my cruel enemies, and setteth me up
above mine adversaries: \* thou shalt rid me from the wicked man.\
50 For this cause will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the
Gentiles, \* and sing praises unto thy Name.\
51 Great prosperity giveth he unto his King, \* and showeth
loving-kindness unto David his anointed, and unto his seed for
evermore.\

The Fourth Day.\
Morning Prayer.

**Psalm 19. Caeli enarrant.**\
THE heavens declare the glory of God; \* and the firmament showeth his
handy-work.\
2 One day telleth another; \* and one night certifieth another.\
3 There is neither speech nor language; \* but their voices are heard
among them.\
4 Their sound is gone out into all lands; \* and their words into the
ends of the world.\
5 In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun; \* which cometh forth as
a bridegroom out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a giant to run his
course.\
6 It goeth forth from the uttermost part of the heaven, and runneth
about unto the end of it again; \* and there is nothing hid from the
heat thereof.\
7 The law of the LORD is an undefiled law, converting the soul; \* the
testimony of the LORD is sure, and giveth wisdom unto the simple.\
8 The statutes of the LORD are right, and rejoice the heart; \* the
commandment of the LORD is pure, and giveth light unto the eyes.\
9 The fear of the LORD is clean, and endureth for ever; \* the judgments
of the LORD are true, and righteous altogether.\
10 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold; \*
sweeter also than honey, and the honeycomb.\
11 Moreover, by them is thy servant taught; \* and in keeping of them
there is great reward.\
12 Who can tell how oft he offendeth? \* O cleanse thou me from my
secret faults.\
13 Keep thy servant also from presumptuous sins, lest they get the
dominion over me; \* so shall I be undefiled, and innocent from the
great offence.\
14 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be alway
acceptable in thy sight, \* O LORD, my strength and my redeemer.\
**\
Psalm 20. Exaudiat te Dominus.**\
THE LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; \* the Name of the God of
Jacob defend thee:\
2 Send thee help from the sanctuary, \* and strengthen thee out of
Sion:\
3 Remember all thy offerings, \* and accept thy burnt-sacrifice:\
4 Grant thee thy heart\'s desire, \* and fulfil all thy mind.\
5 We will rejoice in thy salvation, and triumph in the Name of the Lord
our God: \* the LORD perform all thy petitions.\
6 Now know I that the LORD helpeth his anointed, and will hear him from
his holy heaven, \* even with the wholesome strength of his right hand.\
7 Some put their trust in chariots, and some in horses; \* but we will
remember the Name of the LORD our God.\
8 They are brought down and fallen; \* but we are risen and stand
upright.\
9 Save, LORD; and hear us, O King of heaven, \* when we call upon thee.\
\
**\
Psalm 21. Domine, in virtute tua.**\
THE King shall rejoice in thy strength, O LORD; \* exceeding glad shall
he be of thy salvation.\
2 Thou hast given him his heart\'s desire, \* and hast not denied him
the request of his lips.\
3 For thou shalt meet him with the blessings of goodness, \* and shalt
set a crown of pure gold upon his head.\
4 He asked life of thee; and thou gavest him a long life, \* even for
ever and ever.\
5 His honour is great in thy salvation; \* glory and great worship shalt
thou lay upon him.\
6 For thou shalt give him everlasting felicity, \* and make him glad
with the joy of thy countenance.\
7 And why? because the King putteth his trust in the LORD; \* and in the
mercy of the Most Highest he shall not miscarry.\
8 All thine enemies shall feel thine hand; \* thy right hand shall find
out them that hate thee.\
9 Thou shalt make them like a fiery oven in time of thy wrath: \* the
LORD shall destroy them in his displeasure, and the fire shall consume
them.\
10 Their fruit shalt thou root out of the earth, \* and their seed from
among the children of men.\
11 For they intended mischief against thee, \* and imagined such a
device as they are not able to perform.\
12 Therefore shalt thou put them to flight, \* and the strings of thy
bow shalt thou make ready against the face of them.\
13 Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength; \* so will we sing, and
praise thy power.\

Evening Prayer.

**Psalm 22. Deus, Deus meus.**\
MY God, my God, look upon me; why hast thou forsaken me? \* and art so
far from my health, and from the words of my complaint?\
2 O my God, I cry in the day-time, but thou hearest not; \* and in the
night season also I take no rest.\
3 And thou continuest holy, \* O thou Worship of Israel.\
4 Our fathers hoped in thee; \* they trusted in thee, and thou didst
deliver them.\
5 They called upon thee, and were holpen; \* they put their trust in
thee, and were not confounded.\
6 But as for me, I am a worm, and no man; \* a very scorn of men, and
the outcast of the people.\
7 All they that see me laugh me to scorn; \* they shoot out their lips,
and shake their heads, saying,\
8 He trusted in the LORD, that he would deliver him; \* let him deliver
him, if he will have him.\
9 But thou art he that took me out of my mother\'s womb; \* thou wast my
hope, when I hanged yet upon my mother\'s breasts.\
10 I have been left unto thee ever since I was born; \* thou art my God
even from my mother\'s womb.\
11 O go not from me; for trouble is hard at hand, \* and there is none
to help me.\
12 Many oxen are come about me; \* fat bulls of Bashan close me in on
every side.\
13 They gape upon me with their mouths, \* as it were a ramping and a
roaring lion.\
14 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint; \* my
heart also in the midst of my body is even like melting wax.\
15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my\
tongue cleaveth to my gums, \* and thou bringest me into the dust of
death.\
16 For many dogs are come about me, \* and the council of the wicked
layeth siege against me.\
17 They pierced my hands and my feet: I may tell all my bones: \* they
stand staring and looking upon me.\
18 They part my garments among them, \* and cast lots upon my vesture.\
19 But be not thou far from me, O LORD; \* thou art my succour, haste
thee to help me.\
20 Deliver my soul from the sword, \* my darling from the power of the
dog.\
21 Save me from the lion\'s mouth; \* thou hast heard me also from among
the horns of the unicorns.\
22 I will declare thy Name unto my brethren; \* in the midst of the
congregation will I praise thee.\
23 O praise the LORD, ye that fear him: \* magnify him, all ye of the
seed of Jacob; and fear him, all ye seed of Israel.\
24 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the low estate of the poor; \*
he hath not hid his face from him; but when he called unto him he heard
him.\
25 My praise is of thee in the great-congregation; \* my vows will I
perform in the sight of them that fear him.\
26 The poor shall eat, and be satisfied; they that seek after the LORD
shall praise him: \* your heart shall live for ever.\
27 All the ends of the world shall remember themselves, and be turned
unto the LORD; \* and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship
before him.\
28 For the kingdom is the LORD\'S, \* and he is the Governor among the
nations.\
29 All such as be fat upon earth \* have eaten, and worshipped.\
30 All they that go down into the dust shall kneel before him; \* and no
man hath quickened his own soul.\
31 My seed shall serve him: \* they shall be counted unto the Lord for a
generation.\
32 They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness \* unto a people
that shall be born, whom the Lord hath made.\
\
**\
Psalm 23. Dominus regit me.**\
THE LORD is my shepherd; \* therefore can I lack nothing.\
2 He shall feed me in a green pasture, \* and lead me forth beside the
waters of comfort.\
3 He shall convert my soul, \* and bring me forth in the paths of
righteousness for his Name\'s sake.\
4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will
fear no evil; \* for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff comfort
me.\
5 Thou shalt prepare a table before me in the presence of them that
trouble me; \* thou hast anointed my head with oil, and my cup shall be
full.\
6 Surely thy loving-kindness and mercy shall follow me all the days of
my life; \* and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.\

The Fifth Day.\
\
Morning Prayer.

**Psalm 24. Domini est terra.**\
THE earth is the LORD\'S, and all that therein is; \* the compass of the
world, and they that dwell therein.\
2 For he hath founded it upon the seas, \* and stablished it upon the
floods.\
3 Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? \* or who shall rise up in
his holy place?\
4 Even he that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; \* and that hath not
lift up his mind unto vanity, nor sworn to deceive his neighbour.\
5 He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, \* and righteousness from
the God of his salvation.\
6 This is the generation of them that seek him; \* even of them that
seek thy face, O God of Jacob.\
7 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting
doors; \* and the King of glory shall come in.\
8 Who is this King of glory? \* It is the LORD strong and mighty, even
the LORD mighty in battle.\
9 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting
doors; \* and the King of glory shall come in.\
10 Who is this King of glory? \* Even the LORD of hosts, he is the King
of glory.\
\
**\
Psalm 25. Ad te, Domine, levavi.**\
UNTO thee, O LORD, will I lift up my soul; my God, I have put my trust
in thee: \* O let me not be confounded, neither let mine enemies triumph
over me.\
2 For all they that hope in thee shall not be ashamed; \* but such as
transgress without a cause shall be put to confusion.\
3 Show me thy ways, O LORD, \* and teach me thy paths.\
4 Lead me forth in thy truth, and learn me: \* for thou art the God of
my salvation; in thee hath been my hope all the day long.\
5 Call to remembrance, O LORD, thy tender mercies, \* and thy
loving-kindnesses, which have been ever of old.\
6 O remember not the sins and offences of my youth; \* but according to
thy mercy think thou upon me, O LORD, for thy goodness.\
7 Gracious and righteous is the LORD; \* therefore, will he teach
sinners in the way.\
8 Them that are meek shall he guide in judgment; \* and such as are
gentle, them shall he learn his way.\
9 All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth, \* unto such as keep
his covenant and his testimonies.\
10 For thy Name\'s sake, O LORD, \* be merciful unto my sin; for it is
great.\
11 What man is he that feareth the LORD? \* him shall he teach in the
way that he shall choose.\
12 His soul shall dwell at ease, \* and his seed shall inherit the
land.\
13 The secret of the LORD is among them that fear him; \* and he will
show them his covenant.\
14 Mine eyes are ever looking unto the LORD; \* for he shall pluck my
feet out of the net.\
15 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; \* for I am desolate, and
in misery.\
16 The sorrows of my heart are enlarged: \* O bring thou me out of my
troubles.\
17 Look upon my adversity and misery, \* and forgive me all my sin.\
18 Consider mine enemies, how many they are; \* and they bear a
tyrannous hate against me.\
19 O keep my soul, and deliver me: \* let me not be confounded, for I
have put my trust in thee.\
20 Let perfectness and righteous dealing wait upon me; \* for my hope
hath been in thee.\
21 Deliver Israel, O God, \* out of all his troubles.\
\
**\
Psalm 26. Judica me, Domine.**\
BE thou my Judge, O LORD, for I have walked innocently: \* my trust hath
been also in the LORD, therefore shall I not fall.\
2 Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; \* try out my reins and my heart.\
3 For thy loving-kindness is ever before mine eyes; \* and I will walk
in thy truth.\
4 I have not dwelt with vain persons; \* neither will I have fellowship
with the deceitful.\
5 I have hated the congregation of the wicked; \* and will not sit among
the ungodly.\
6 I will wash my hands in innocency, O LORD; \* and so will I go to
thine altar;\
7 That I may show the voice of thanksgiving, \* and tell of all thy
wondrous works.\
8 LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, \* and the place where
thine honour dwelleth.\
9 O shut not up my soul with the sinners, \* nor my life with the
blood-thirsty;\
10 In whose hands is wickedness, \* and their right hand is full of
gifts.\
11 But as for me, I will walk innocently: \* O deliver me, and be
merciful unto me.\
12 My foot standeth right: \* I will praise the LORD in the
congregations.\

Evening Prayer.

**Psalm 27. Dominus illuminatio.**\
THE LORD is my light and my salvation; whom then shall I fear? \* the
LORD is the strength of my life; of whom then shall I be afraid?\
2 When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up
my flesh, \* they stumbled and fell.\
3 Though an host of men were laid against me, yet shall not my heart be
afraid; \* and though there rose up war against me, yet will I put my
trust in him.\
4 One thing have I desired of the LORD, which I will require; \* even
that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to
behold the fair beauty of the LORD, and to visit his temple.\
5 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his tabernacle; \* yea,
in the secret place of his dwelling shall he hide me, and set me up upon
a rock of stone.\
6 And now shall he lift up mine head \* above mine enemies round about
me.\
7 Therefore will I offer in his dwelling an oblation, with great
gladness: \* I will sing and speak praises unto the LORD.\
8 Hearken unto my voice, O LORD, when I cry unto thee; \* have mercy
upon me, and hear me.\
9 My heart hath talked of thee, Seek ye my face: \* Thy face, LORD, will
I seek.\
10 O hide not thou thy face from me, \* nor cast thy servant away in
displeasure.\
11 Thou hast been my succour; \* leave me not, neither forsake me, O God
of my salvation.\
12 When my father and my mother forsake me, \* the LORD taketh me up.\
13 Teach me thy way, O LORD, \* and lead me in the right way, because of
mine enemies.\
14 Deliver me not over into the will of mine adversaries: \* for there
are false witnesses risen up against me, and such as speak wrong.\
15 I should utterly have fainted, \* but that I believe verily to see
the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.\
16 O tarry thou the LORD\'S leisure; \* be strong, and he shall comfort
thine heart; and put thou thy trust in the LORD.\
**\
\
Psalm 28. Ad te, Domine.**\
UNTO thee will I cry, O LORD, my strength: \* think no scorn of me;
lest, if thou make as though thou hearest not, I become like them that
go down into the pit.\
2 Hear the voice of my humble petitions, when I cry unto thee; \* when I
hold up my hands towards the mercyseat of thy holy temple.\
3 O pluck me not away, neither destroy me with the ungodly and wicked
doers, \* which speak friendly to their neighbours, but imagine mischief
in their hearts.\
4 Reward them according to their deeds, \* and according to the
wickedness of their own inventions.\
5 Recompense them after the work of their hands; \* pay them that they
have deserved.\
6 For they regard not in their mind the works of the LORD, nor the
operation of his hands; \* therefore shall he break them down, and not
build them up.\
7 Praised be the LORD; \* for he hath heard the voice of my humble
petitions.\
8 The LORD is my strength, and my shield; my heart hath trusted in him,
and I am helped; \* therefore my heart danceth for joy, and in my song
will I praise him.\
9 The LORD is my strength, \* and he is the wholesome defence of his
anointed.\
10 O save thy people, and give thy blessing unto thine inheritance: \*
feed them, and set them up for ever.\
\
**\
Psalm 29. Afferte Domino.**\
A SCRIBE unto the LORD, O ye mighty, \* ascribe unto the LORD worship
and strength.\
2 Ascribe unto the LORD the honour due unto his Name; \* worship the
LORD with holy worship.\
3 The voice of the LORD is upon the waters; \* it is the glorious God
that maketh the thunder.\
4 It is the LORD that ruleth the sea; the voice of the LORD is mighty in
operation; \* the voice of the LORD is a glorious voice.\
5 The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedar-trees; \* yea, the LORD
breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.\
6 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; \* Lebanon also, and Sirion,
like a young unicorn.\
7 The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire; the voice of the
LORD shaketh the wilderness; \* yea, the LORD shaketh the wilderness of
Kadesh.\
8 The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to bring forth young, and
strippeth bare the forests: \* in his temple doth every thing speak of
his honour.\
9 The LORD sitteth above the water-flood, \* and the LORD remaineth a
King for ever.\
10 The LORD shall give strength unto his people; \* the LORD shall give
his people the blessing of peace.\

The Sixth Day.\
\
Morning Prayer.

**Psalm 30. Exaltabo te, Domine.**\
I WILL magnify thee, O LORD; for thou hast set me up, \* and not made my
foes to triumph over me.\
2 O LORD my God, I cried unto thee; \* and thou hast healed me.\
3 Thou, LORD, hast brought my soul out of hell: \* thou hast kept my
life, that I should not go down into the pit.\
4 Sing praises unto the LORD, O ye saints of his; \* and give thanks
unto him, for a remembrance of his holiness.\
5 For his wrath endureth but the twinkling of an eye, and in his
pleasure is life; \* heaviness may endure for a night, but joy cometh in
the morning.\
6 And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be removed: \* thou, LORD,
of thy goodness, hast made my hill so strong.\
7 Thou didst turn thy face from me, \* and I was troubled.\
8 Then cried I unto thee, O LORD; \* and gat me to my LORD right
humbly.\
9 What profit is there in my blood, \* when I go down into the pit?\
10 Shall the dust give thanks unto thee? \* or shall it declare thy
truth?\
11 Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me; \* LORD, be thou my helper.\
12 Thou hast turned my heaviness into joy; \* thou hast put off my
sackcloth, and girded me with gladness:\
13 Therefore shall every good man sing of thy praise without ceasing. \*
O my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.\
\
**\
Psalm 31. In te, Domine, speravi.**\
IN thee, O LORD, have I put my trust; let me never be put to confusion;
\* deliver me in thy righteousness.\
2 Bow down thine ear to me; \* make haste to deliver me.\
3 And be thou my strong rock, and house of defence, \* that thou mayest
save me.\
4 For thou art my strong rock, and my castle: \* be thou also my guide,
and lead me for thy Name\'s sake.\
5 Draw me out of the net that they have laid privily for me; \* for thou
art my strength.\
6 Into thy hands I commend my spirit; \* for thou hast redeemed me, O
LORD, thou God of truth.\
7 I have hated them that hold of lying vanities, \* and my trust hath
been in the LORD.\
8 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy; \* for thou hast considered
my trouble, and hast known my soul in adversities.\
9 Thou hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy; \* but hast set
my feet in a large room.\
10 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble, \* and mine eye is
consumed for very heaviness; yea, my soul and my body.\
11 For my life is waxen old with heaviness, \* and my years with
mourning.\
12 My strength faileth me, because of mine iniquity, \* and my bones are
consumed.\
13 I became a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my
neighbours; \* and they of mine acquaintance were afraid of me; and they
that did see me without, conveyed themselves from me.\
14 I am clean forgotten as a dead man out of mind; \* I am become like a
broken vessel.\
15 For I have heard the blasphemy of the multitude, and fear is on every
side; \* while they conspire together against me, and take their counsel
to take away my life.\
16 But my hope hath been in thee, O LORD; \* I have said, Thou art my
God.\
17 My times are in thy hand; deliver me from the hand of mine enemies,
\* and from them that persecute me.\
18 Show thy servant the light of thy countenance, \* and save me for thy
mercy\'s sake.\
19 Let me not be confounded, O LORD, for I have called upon thee; \* let
the ungodly be put to confusion, and be put to silence in the grave.\
20 Let the lying lips be put to silence, \* which cruelly, disdainfully,
and despitefully speak against the righteous.\
21 O how plentiful is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them
that fear thee, \* and that thou hast prepared for them that put their
trust in thee, even before the sons of men!\
22 Thou shalt hide them in the covert of thine own presence from the
plottings of men: \* thou shalt keep them secretly in thy tabernacle
from the strife of tongues.\
23 Thanks be to the LORD; \* for he hath showed me marvellous great
kindness in a strong city.\
24 But in my haste I said, \* I am cast out of the sight of thine eyes.\
25 Nevertheless, thou heardest the voice of my prayer, \* when I cried
unto thee.\
26 O love the LORD, all ye his saints; \* for the LORD preserveth them
that are faithful, and plenteously rewardeth the proud doer.\
27 Be strong, and he shall establish your heart, \* all ye that put your
trust in the LORD.\

Evening Prayer.

**Psalm 32. Beati quorum.**\
BLESSED is he whose unrighteousness is forgiven, \* and whose sin is
covered.\
2 Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth no sin, \* and in whose
spirit there is no guile.\
3 For whilst I held my tongue, \* my bones consumed away through my
daily complaining.\
4 For thy hand was heavy upon me day and night, \* and my moisture was
like the drought in summer.\
5 I acknowledged my sin unto thee; \* and mine unrighteousness have I
not hid.\
6 I said, I will confess my sins unto the LORD; \* and SO thou forgavest
the wickedness of my sin.\
7 For this shall every one that is godly make his prayer unto thee, in a
time when thou mayest be found; \* surely the great water-floods shall
not come nigh him.\
8 Thou art a place to hide me in; thou shalt preserve me from trouble;
\* thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance.\
9 I will inform thee, and teach thee in the way wherein thou shalt go;
\* and I will guide thee with mine eye.\
10 Be ye not like to horse and mule, which have no understanding; \*
whose mouths must be held with bit and bridle, else they will not obey
thee.\
11 Great plagues remain for the ungodly; \* but whoso putteth his trust
in the LORD, mercy embraceth him on every side.\
12 Be glad, O ye righteous, and rejoice in the LORD; \* and be joyful,
all ye that are true of heart.\
\
**\
Psalm 33. Exultate, justi.**\
REJOICE in the LORD, O ye righteous; \* for it becometh well the just to
be thankful.\
2 Praise the LORD with harp; \* sing praises unto him with the lute, and
instrument of ten strings.\
3 Sing unto the Lord a new song; \* sing praises lustily unto him with a
good courage.\
4 For the word of the LORD is true; \* and all his works are faithful.\
5 He loveth righteousness and judgment; \* the earth is full of the
goodness of the LORD.\
6 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; \* and all the host of
them by the breath of his mouth.\
7 He gathereth the waters of the sea together, as it were upon an heap;
\* and layeth up the deep, as in a treasure-house.\
8 Let all the earth fear the LORD: \* stand in awe of him, all ye that
dwell in the world.\
9 For he spake, and it was done; \* he commanded, and it stood fast.\
10 The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought, \* and maketh
the devices of the people to be of none effect, and casteth out the
counsels of princes.\
11 The counsel of the LORD shall endure for ever, \* and the thoughts of
his heart from generation to generation.\
12 Blessed are the people whose God is the Lord JEHOVAH; \* and blessed
are the folk that he hath chosen to him, to be his inheritance.\
13 The LORD looketh down from heaven, and beholdeth all the children of
men; \* from the habitation of his dwelling, he considereth all them
that dwell on the earth.\
14 He fashioneth all the hearts of them, \* and understandeth all their
works.\
15 There is no king that can be saved by the multitude of an host; \*
neither is any mighty man delivered by much strength.\
16 A horse is counted but a vain thing to save a man; \* neither shall
he deliver any man by his great strength.\
17 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, \* and upon
them that put their trust in his mercy;\
18 To deliver their soul from death, \* and to feed them in the time of
dearth.\
19 Our soul hath patiently tarried for the LORD; \* for he is our help
and our shield.\
20 For our heart shall rejoice in him; \* because we have hoped in his
holy Name.\
21 Let thy merciful kindness, O LORD, be upon us, \* like as we do put
our trust in thee.\
\
**\
Psalm 34. Benedicam Dominum.**\
I WILL alway give thanks unto the LORD; \* his praise shall ever be in
my mouth.\
2 My soul shall make her boast in the LORD; \* the humble shall hear
thereof, and be glad.\
3 O praise the LORD with me, \* and let us magnify his Name together.\
4 I sought the LORD, and he heard me; \* yea, he delivered me out of all
my fear.\
5 They had an eye unto him, and were lightened; \* and their faces were
not ashamed.\
6 Lo, the poor crieth, and the LORD heareth him; \* yea, and saveth him
out of all his troubles.\
7 The angel of the LORD tarrieth round about them that fear him, \* and
delivereth them.\
8 O taste, and see, how gracious the LORD is: \* blessed is the man that
trusteth in him.\
9 O fear the LORD, ye that are his saints; \* for they that fear him
lack nothing.\
10 The lions do lack, and suffer hunger; \* but they who seek the LORD
shall want no manner of thing that is good.\
11 Come, ye children, and hearken unto me; \* I will teach you the fear
of the LORD.\
12 What man is he that lusteth to live, \* and would fain see good
days?\
13 Keep thy tongue from evil, \* and thy lips, that they speak no
guile.\
14 Eschew evil, and do good; \* seek peace, and ensue it.\
15 The eyes of the LORD are over the righteous, \* and his ears are open
unto their prayers.\
16 The countenance of the LORD is against them that do evil, \* to root
out the remembrance of them from the earth.\
17 The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth them, \* and delivereth them
out of all their troubles.\
18 The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart, \* and will
save such as be of an humble spirit.\
19 Great are the troubles of the righteous; \* but the LORD delivereth
him out of all.\
20 He keepeth all his bones, \* so that not one of them is broken.\
21 But misfortune shall slay the ungodly; \* and they that hate the
righteous shall be desolate.\
22 The LORD delivereth the souls of his servants; \* and all they that
put their trust in him shall not be destitute.\

The Seventh Day.\
\
Morning Prayer.

**Psalm 35. Judica, Domine.**\
PLEAD thou my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me, \* and fight
thou against them that fight against me.\
2 Lay hand upon the shield and buckler, \* and stand up to help me.\
3 Bring forth the spear, and stop the way against them that pursue me:
\* say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.\
4 Let them be confounded, and put to shame, that seek after my soul; \*
let them be turned back, and brought to confusion, that imagine mischief
for me.\
5 Let them be as the dust before the wind, \* and the angel of the LORD
scattering them.\
6 Let their way be dark and slippery, \* and let the angel of the LORD
pursue them.\
7 For they have privily laid their net to destroy me without a cause; \*
yea, even without a cause have they made a pit for my soul.\
8 Let a sudden destruction come upon him unawares, and his net that he
hath laid privily catch himself; \* that he may fall into his own
mischief.\
9 And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD; \* it shall rejoice in his
salvation.\
10 All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, who deliverest
the poor from him that is too strong for him; \* yea, the poor, and him
that is in misery, from him that spoileth him?\
11 False witnesses did rise up: \* they laid to my charge things that I
knew not.\
12 They rewarded me evil for good, \* to the great discomfort of my
soul.\
13 Nevertheless, when they were sick, I put on sackcloth, and humbled my
soul with fasting; \* and my prayer shall turn into mine own bosom.\
14 I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother; \* I
went heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.\
15 But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves
together; \* yea, the very abjects came together against me unawares,
making mouths at me, and ceased not.\
16 With the flatterers were busy mockers, \* who gnashed upon me with
their teeth.\
17 Lord, how long wilt thou look upon this? \* O deliver my soul from
the calamities which they bring on me, and my darling from the lions.\
18 So will I give thee thanks in the great congregation; \* I will
praise thee among much people.\
19 O let not them that are mine enemies triumph over me ungodly; \*
neither let them wink with their eyes, that hate me without a cause.\
20 And why? their communing is not for peace; \* but they imagine
deceitful words against them that are quiet in the land.\
21 They gaped upon me with their mouths, and said, \* Fie on thee! fie
on thee! we saw it with our eyes.\
22 This thou hast seen, O LORD; \* hold not thy tongue then; go not far
from me, O Lord.\
23 Awake, and stand up to judge my quarrel; \* avenge thou my cause, my
God and my Lord.\
24 Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; \* and let
them not triumph over me.\
25 Let them not say in their hearts, There! there! so would we have it;
\* neither let them say, We have devoured him.\
26 Let them be put to confusion and shame together, that rejoice at my
trouble; \* let them be clothed with rebuke and dishonour, that boast
themselves against me.\
27 Let them be glad and rejoice, that favour my righteous dealing; \*
yea, let them say alway, Blessed be the LORD, who hath pleasure in the
prosperity of his servant.\
28 And as for my tongue, it shall be talking of thy righteousness, \*
and of thy praise, all the day long.\
\
**\
Psalm 36. Dixit injustus.**\
MY heart showeth me the wickedness of the ungodly, \* that there is no
fear of God before his eyes.\
2 For he flattereth himself in his own sight, \* until his abominable
sin be found out.\
3 The words of his mouth are unrighteous and full of deceit: \* he hath
left off to behave himself wisely, and to do good.\
4 He imagineth mischief upon his bed, and hath set himself in no good
way; \* neither doth he abhor any thing that is evil.\
5 Thy mercy, O LORD, reacheth unto the\' heavens, \* and thy
faithfulness unto the clouds.\
6 Thy righteousness standeth like the strong mountains: \* thy judgments
are like the great deep.\
7 Thou, LORD, shalt save both man and beast: how excellent is thy mercy,
O God! \* and the children of men shall put their trust under the shadow
of thy wings.\
8 They shall be satisfied with the plenteousness of thy house; \* and
thou shalt give them drink of thy pleasures, as out of the river.\
9 For with thee is the well of life; \* and in thy light shall we see
light.\
10 O continue forth thy loving-kindness unto them that know thee, \* and
thy righteousness unto them that are true of heart.\
11 O let not the foot of pride come against me; \* and let not the hand
of the ungodly cast me down.\
12 There are they fallen, all that work wickedness; \* they are cast
down, and shall not be able to stand.\

Evening Prayer.

**Psalm 37. Noli aemulari.**\
FRET not thyself because of the ungodly; \* neither be thou envious
against the evil doers.\
2 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, \* and be withered
even as the green herb.\
3 Put thou thy trust in the LORD, and be doing good; \* dwell in the
land, and verily thou shalt be fed.\
4 Delight thou in the LORD, \* and he shall give thee thy heart\'s
desire.\
5 Commit thy way unto the LORD, and put thy trust in him, \* and he
shall bring it to pass.\
6 He shall make thy righteousness as clear as the light, \* and thy just
dealing as the noon-day.\
7 Hold thee still in the LORD, and abide patiently upon him: \* but
grieve not thyself at him whose way doth prosper, against the man that
doeth after evil counsels.\
8 Leave off from wrath, and let go displeasure: \* fret not thyself,
else shalt thou be moved to do evil.\
9 Wicked doers shall be rooted out; \* and they that patiently abide the
LORD, those shall inherit the land.\
10 Yet a little while, and the ungodly shall be clean gone: \* thou
shalt look after his place, and he shall be away.\
11 But the meek-spirited shall possess the earth, \* and shall be
refreshed in the multitude of peace.\
12 The ungodly seeketh counsel against the just, \* and gnasheth upon
him with his teeth.\
13 The Lord shall laugh him to-scorn; \* for he hath seen that his day
is coming.\
14 The ungodly have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, \* to
cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be upright in their
ways.\
15 Their sword shall go through their own heart, \* and their bow shall
be broken.\
16 A small thing that the righteous hath, \* is better than great riches
of the ungodly.\
17 For the arms of the ungodly shall be broken, \* and the LORD
upholdeth the righteous.\
18 The LORD knoweth the days of the godly; \* and their inheritance
shall endure for ever.\
19 They shall not be confounded in the perilous time; \* and in the days
of dearth they shall have enough.\
20 As for the ungodly, they shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD
shall consume as the fat of lambs: \* yea, even as the smoke shall they
consume away.\
21 The ungodly borroweth, and payeth not again; \* but the righteous is
merciful and liberal.\
22 Such as are blessed of God, shall possess the land; \* and they that
are cursed of him, shall be rooted out.\
23 The LORD ordereth a good man\'s going, \* and maketh his way
acceptable to himself.\
24 Though he fall, he shall not be cast away; \* for the LORD upholdeth
him with his hand.\
25 I have been young, and now am old; \* and yet saw I never the
righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging their bread.\
26 The righteous is ever merciful, and lendeth; \* and his seed is
blessed.\
27 Flee from evil, and do the thing that is good; \* and dwell for
evermore.\
28 For the LORD loveth the thing that is right; \* he forsaketh not his
that be godly, but they are preserved for ever.\
29 The unrighteous shall be punished; \* as for the seed of the ungodly,
it shall be rooted out.\
30 The righteous shall inherit the land, \* and dwell therein for ever.\
31 The mouth of the righteous is exercised in wisdom, \* and his tongue
will be talking of judgment.\
32 The law of his God is in his heart, \* and his goings shall not
slide.\
33 The ungodly watcheth the righteous, \* and seeketh occasion to slay
him.\
34 The LORD will not leave him in his hand, \* nor condemn him when he
is judged.\
35 Hope thou in the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall promote thee,
that thou shalt possess the land: \* when the ungodly shall perish, thou
shalt see it.\
36 I myself have seen the ungodly in great power, \* and flourishing
like a green bay-tree.\
37 I went by, and lo, he was gone: \* I sought him, but his place could
no where be found.\
38 Keep innocency, and take heed unto the thing that is right; \* for
that shall bring a man peace at the last.\
39 As for the transgressors, they shall perish together; \* and the end
of the ungodly is, they shall be rooted out at the last.\
40 But the salvation of the righteous cometh of the LORD; \* who is also
their strength in the time of trouble.\
41 And the LORD shall stand by them, and save them: \* he shall deliver
them from the ungodly, and shall save them, because they put their trust
in him.\

Morning Prayer.

**Psalm 38. Domine, ne in furore.**\
PUT me not to rebuke, O LORD, in thine anger; \* neither chasten me in
thy heavy displeasure:\
2 For thine arrows stick fast in me, \* and thy hand presseth me sore.\
3 There is no health in my flesh, because of thy displeasure; \* neither
is there any rest in my bones, by reason of my sin.\
4 For my wickednesses are gone over my head, \* and are like a sore
burden, too heavy for me to bear.\
5 My wounds stink, and are corrupt, \* through my foolishness.\
6 I am brought into so great trouble and misery, \* that I go mourning
all the day long.\
7 For my loins are filled with a sore disease, \* and there is no whole
part in my body.\
8 I am feeble and sore smitten; \* I have roared for the very
disquietness of my heart.\
9 Lord, thou knowest all my desire; \* and my groaning is not hid from
thee.\
10 My heart panteth, my strength hath failed me, \* and the light of
mine eyes is gone from me.\
11 My lovers and my neighbours did stand looking upon my trouble, \* and
my kinsmen stood afar off.\
12 They also that sought after my life laid snares for me; \* and they
that went about to do me evil talked of wickedness, and imagined deceit
all the day long.\
13 As for me, I was like a deaf man, and heard not; \* and as one that
is dumb, who doth not open his mouth.\
14 I became even as a man that heareth not, \* and in whose mouth are no
reproofs.\
15 For in thee, O LORD, have I put my trust; \* thou shalt answer for
me, O Lord my God.\
16 I have required that they, even mine enemies, should not triumph over
me; \* for when my foot slipt, they rejoiced greatly against me.\
17 And I truly am set in the plague, \* and my heaviness is ever in my
sight.\
18 For I will confess my wickedness, \* and be sorry for my sin.\
19 But mine enemies live, and are mighty; \* and they that hate me
wrongfully are many in number.\
20 They also that reward evil for good are against me; \* because I
follow the thing that good is.\
21 Forsake me not, O LORD my God; \* be not thou far from me.\
\
**\
Psalm 39. Dixi, Custodiam.**\
I SAID, I will take heed to my ways, \* that I offend not in my tongue\
2 I will keep my mouth as it were with a bridle, \* while the ungodly is
in my sight.\
3 I held my tongue, and spake nothing: \* I kept silence, yea, even from
good words; but it was pain and grief to me.\
4 My heart was hot within me: and while I was thus musing the fire
kindled, \* and at the last I spake with my tongue:\
5 LORD, let me know mine end, and the number of my days; \* that I may
be certified how long I have to live.\
6 Behold, thou hast made my days as it were a span long, and mine age is
even as nothing in respect of thee; \* and verily every man living is
altogether vanity.\
7 For man walketh in a vain shadow, and disquieteth himself in vain; \*
he heapeth up riches, and cannot tell who shall gather them.\
8 And now, Lord, what is my hope? \* truly my hope is even in thee.\
9 Deliver me from all mine offences; \* and make me not a rebuke unto
the foolish.\
10 I became dumb, and opened not my mouth; \* for it was thy doing.\
11 Take thy plague away from me: \* I am even consumed by the means of
thy heavy hand.\
12 When thou with rebukes dost chasten man for sin, thou makest his
beauty to consume away, like as it were a moth fretting a garment: \*
every man therefore is but vanity.\
13 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and with thine ears consider my calling; \*
hold not thy peace at my tears;\
14 For I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, \* as all my fathers
were.\
15 O spare me a little, that I may recover my strength, \* before I go
hence, and be no more seen.\
\
**\
Psalm 40. Expectans expectavi.**\
I WAITED patiently for the LORD, \* and he inclined unto me, and heard
my calling.\
2 He brought me also out of the horrible pit, out of the mire and clay,
\* and set my feet upon the rock, and ordered my goings.\
3 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, \* even a thanksgiving unto
our God.\
4 Many shall see it, and fear, \* and shall put their trust in the
LORD.\
5 Blessed is the man that hath set his hope in the LORD, \* and turned
not unto the proud, and to such as go about with lies.\
6 O LORD my God, great are the wondrous works which thou hast done, like
as be also thy thoughts, which are to us-ward; \* and yet there is no
man that ordereth them unto thee.\
7 If I should declare them, and speak of them, \* they should be more
than I am able to express.\
8 Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, \* but mine ears hast thou
opened.\
9 Burnt-offering and sacrifice for sin hast thou not required: \* then
said I, LO, I come;\
10 In the volume of the book it is written of me, that I should fulfil
thy will, O my God: \* I am content to do it; yea, thy law is within my
heart.\
11 I have declared thy righteousness in the great congregation: \* lo, I
will not refrain my lips, O LORD, and that thou knowest.\
12 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; \* my talk hath
been of thy truth, and of thy salvation.\
13 I have not kept back thy loving mercy and truth \* from the great
congregation.\
14 Withdraw not thou thy mercy from me, O LORD; \* let thy
loving-kindness and thy truth alway preserve me.\
15 For innumerable troubles are come about me; my sins have taken such
hold upon me, that I am not able to look up; \* yea, they are more in
number than the hairs of my head, and my heart hath failed me.\
16 O LORD, let it be thy pleasure to deliver me; \* make haste, O LORD,
to help me.\
17 Let them be ashamed, and confounded together, that seek after my soul
to destroy it; \* let them be driven backward, and put to rebuke, that
wish me evil.\
18 Let them be desolate, and rewarded with shame, \* that say unto me,
Fie upon thee! fie upon thee!\
19 Let all those that seek thee, be joyful and glad in thee; \* and let
such as love thy salvation, say alway, The LORD be praised.\
20 As for me, I am poor and needy; \* but the Lord careth for me.\
21 Thou art my helper and redeemer; \* make no long tarrying, O my God.\

Evening Prayer.

**Psalm 41. Beatus qui intelligit.**\
BLESSED is he that considereth the poor and needy; \* the LORD shall
deliver him in the time of trouble.\
2 The LORD preserve him, and keep him alive, that he may be blessed upon
earth; \* and deliver not thou him into the will of his enemies.\
3 The LORD comfort him when he lieth sick upon his bed; \* make thou all
his bed in his sickness.\
4 I said, LORD, be merciful unto me; \* heal my soul, for I have sinned
against thee.\
5 Mine enemies speak evil of me, \* When shall he die, and his name
perish?\
6 And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity, \* and his heart
conceiveth falsehood within himself; and when he cometh forth, he
telleth it.\
7 All mine enemies whisper together against me; \* even against me do
they imagine this evil.\
8 An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him; \* and now that he
lieth, he shall rise up no more.\
9 Yea, even mine own familiar friend whom I trusted, \* who did also eat
of my bread, hath laid great wait for me.\
10 But be thou merciful unto me, O LORD; \* raise thou me up again, and
I shall reward them.\
11 By this I know thou favourest me, \* that mine enemy doth not triumph
against me.\
12 And in my innocency thou upholdest me, \* and shalt set me before thy
face for ever.\
13 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, \* world without end. Amen.
