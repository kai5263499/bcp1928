| **Psalms 29. Afferte Domino.**\                                       |
| ASCRIBE unto the LORD, O ye mighty, \* ascribe unto the LORD worship  |
| and strength.\                                                        |
| 2 Ascribe unto the LORD the honour due unto his Name; \* worship the  |
| LORD with holy worship.\                                              |
| 3 The voice of the LORD is upon the waters; \* it is the glorious God |
| that maketh the thunder.\                                             |
| 4 It is the LORD that ruleth the sea; the voice of the LORD is mighty |
| in operation; \* the voice of the LORD is a glorious voice.\          |
| 5 The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedar-trees; \* yea, the LORD    |
| breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.\                                      |
| 6 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; \* Lebanon also, and       |
| Sirion, like a young unicorn.\                                        |
| 7 The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire; the voice of the |
| LORD shaketh the wilderness; \* yea, the LORD shaketh the wilderness  |
| of Kadesh.\                                                           |
| 8 The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to bring forth young, and    |
| strippeth bare the forests: \* in his temple doth every thing speak   |
| of his honour.\                                                       |
| 9 The LORD sitteth above the water-flood, \* and the LORD remaineth a |
| King for ever.\                                                       |
| 10 The LORD shall give strength unto his people; \* the LORD shall    |
| give his people the blessing of peace.                                |
