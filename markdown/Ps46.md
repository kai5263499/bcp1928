| **Psalms 46. Deus noster refugium.**\                                 |
| GOD is our hope and strength, \* a very present help in trouble.\     |
| 2 Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be moved, \* and       |
| though the hills be carried into the midst of the sea;\               |
| 3 Though the waters thereof rage and swell, \* and though the         |
| mountains shake at the tempest of the same.\                          |
| 4 There is a river, the streams whereof make glad the city of God; \* |
| the holy place of the tabernacle of the Most Highest.\                |
| 5 God is in the midst of her, therefore shall she not be removed; \*  |
| God shall help her, and that right early.\                            |
| 6 The nations make much ado, and the kingdoms are moved; \* but God   |
| hath showed his voice, and the earth shall melt away.\                |
| 7 The LORD of hosts is with us; \* the God of Jacob is our refuge.\   |
| 8 O come hither, and behold the works of the LORD, \* what            |
| destruction he hath brought upon the earth.\                          |
| 9 He maketh wars to cease in all the world; \* he breaketh the bow,   |
| and knappeth the spear in sunder, and burneth the chariots in the     |
| fire.\                                                                |
| 10 Be still then, and know that I am God: \* I will be exalted among  |
| the nations, and I will be exalted in the earth.\                     |
| 11 The LORD of hosts is with us; \* the God of Jacob is our refuge.   |
