**Psalm 95. Venite, exultemus.**\
O COME, let us sing unto the LORD; \* let us heartily rejoice in the
strength of our salvation.\
2 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving; \* and show
ourselves glad in him with psalms.\
3 For the LORD is a great God; \* and a great King above all gods.\
4 In his hand are all the corners of the earth; \* and the strength of
the hills is his also.\
5 The sea is his, and he made it; \* and his hands prepared the dry
land.\
6 O come, let us worship and fall down, \* and kneel before the LORD our
Maker.\
7 For he is the Lord our God; \* and we are the people of his pasture,
and the sheep of his hand.\
8 To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts \* as in the
provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness;\
9 When your fathers tempted me, \* proved me, and saw my works.\
10 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, \* It
is a people that do err in their hearts, for they have not known my
ways:\
11 Unto whom I sware in my wrath, \* that they should not enter into my
rest.\

**Psalm 96. Cantate Domino**.\
O SING unto the LORD a new song; \* sing unto the LORD, all the whole
earth.\
2 Sing unto the LORD, and praise his Name; \* be telling of his
salvation from day to day.\
3 Declare his honour unto the heathen, \* and his wonders unto all
peoples.\
4 For the LORD is great, and cannot worthily be praised;\* he is more to
be feared than all gods.\
5 As for all the gods of the heathen, they are but idols; \* but it is
the LORD that made the heavens.\
6 Glory and worship are before him; \* power and honour are in his
sanctuary.\
7 Ascribe unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the peoples, \* ascribe unto
the LORD worship and power.\
8 Ascribe unto the LORD the honour due unto his Name; \* bring presents,
and come into his courts.\
9 O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness; \* let the whole earth
stand in awe of him.\
10 Tell it out among the heathen, that the LORD is King, and that it is
he who hath made the round world so fast that it cannot be moved; \* and
how that he shall judge the peoples righteously.\
11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; \* let the sea
make a noise, and all that therein is.\
12 Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it; \* then shall all the
trees of the wood rejoice before the LORD.\
13 For he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth; \* and with
righteousness to judge the world, and the peoples with his truth.\

**Psalm 97. Dominus regnavit.**\
THE LORD is King, the earth may be glad thereof; \* yea, the multitude
of the isles may be glad thereof.\
2 Clouds and darkness are round about him: \* righteousness and judgment
are the habitation of his seat.\
3 There shall go a fire before him, \* and burn up his enemies on every
side.\
4 His lightnings gave shine unto the world: \* the earth saw it, and was
afraid.\
5 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD; \* at the
presence of the Lord of the whole earth.\
6 The heavens have declared his righteousness, \* and all the peoples
have seen his glory.\
7 Confounded be all they that worship carved images, and that delight in
vain gods: \* worship him, all ye gods.\
8 Sion heard of it, and rejoiced; and the daughters of Judah were glad,
\* because of thy judgments, O LORD.\
9 For thou, LORD, art higher than all that are in the earth: \* thou art
exalted far above all gods.\
10 O ye that love the LORD, see that ye hate the thing which is evil: \*
the Lord preserveth the souls of his saints; he shall deliver them from
the hand of the ungodly.\
11 There is sprung up a light for the righteous, \* and joyful gladness
for such as are true-hearted.\
12 Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; \* and give thanks for a
remembrance of his holiness.
