| **Psalms 13. Usquequo, Domine?**\                                     |
| HOW long wilt thou forget me, O LORD; for ever? \* how long wilt thou |
| hide thy face from me?\                                               |
| 2 How long shall I seek counsel in my soul, and be so vexed in my     |
| heart? \* how long shall mine enemy triumph over me?\                 |
| 3 Consider, and hear me, O LORD my God; \* lighten mine eyes, that I  |
| sleep not in death;\                                                  |
| 4 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him: \* for if I be   |
| cast down, they that trouble me will rejoice at it.\                  |
| 5 But my trust is in thy mercy, \* and my heart is joyful in thy      |
| salvation.\                                                           |
| 6 I will sing of the LORD, because he hath dealt so lovingly with me; |
| \* yea, I will praise the Name of the Lord Most Highest.              |
