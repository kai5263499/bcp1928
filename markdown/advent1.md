| 5 There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain       |
| priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of    |
| the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.\                  |
| 6 And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the         |
| commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.\                   |
| 7 And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they  |
| both were now well stricken in years.\                                |
| 8 And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest\'s office    |
| before God in the order of his course,\                               |
| 9 According to the custom of the priest\'s office, his lot was to     |
| burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.\               |
| 10 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the  |
| time of incense.\                                                     |
| 11 And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the   |
| right side of the altar of incense.\                                  |
| 12 And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon    |
| him.\                                                                 |
| 13 But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer   |
| is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou      |
| shalt call his name John.\                                            |
| 14 And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at    |
| his birth.\                                                           |
| 15 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink    |
| neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy   |
| Ghost, even from his mother\'s womb.\                                 |
| 16 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their |
| God.\                                                                 |
| 17 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to    |
| turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient   |
| to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the    |
| Lord.\                                                                |
| 18 And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for  |
| I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.\                 |
| 19 And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in |
| the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to show thee |
| these glad tidings.\                                                  |

| 21 And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried |
| so long in the temple.\                                               |
| 22 And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they       |
| perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned    |
| unto them, and remained speechless.\                                  |
| 23 And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration |
| were accomplished, he departed to his own house.\                     |
| 24 And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself |
| five months, saying,\                                                 |

| 1 And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son  |
| of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the |
| son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war      |
| against it, but could not prevail against it.\                        |
| 2 And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate    |
| with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people,   |
| as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.\                    |
| 3 Then said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou,    |
| and Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool  |
| in the highway of the fuller\'s field;\                               |
| 4 And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be     |
| fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the   |
| fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.\        |
| 5 Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil    |
| counsel against thee, saying,\                                        |
| 6 Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach    |
| therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, even the son of    |
| Tabeal:\                                                              |
