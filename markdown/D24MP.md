**Psalm 116. Dilexi, quoniam.**\
MY delight is in the LORD; \* because he hath heard the voice of my
prayer;\
2 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me; \* therefore will I call
upon him as long as I live.\
3 The snares of death compassed me round about, \* and the pains of hell
gat hold upon me.\
4 I found trouble and heaviness; then called I upon the Name of the
LORD; \* O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.\
5 Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; \* yea, our God is merciful.\
6 The LORD preserveth the simple: \* I was in misery, and he helped me.\
7 Turn again then unto thy rest, O my soul; \* for the LORD hath
rewarded thee.\
8 And why? thou hast delivered my soul from death, \* mine eyes from
tears, and my feet from falling.\
9 I will walk before the LORD \* in the land of the living.\
10 I believed, and therefore will I speak; but I was sore troubled: \* I
said in my haste, All men are liars.\
11 What reward shall I give unto the LORD \* for all the benefits that
he hath done unto me?\
12 I will receive the cup of salvation, \* and call upon the Name of the
LORD.\
13 I will pay my vows now in the presence of all his people: \* right
dear in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.\
14 Behold, O LORD, how that I am thy servant; \* I am thy servant, and
the son of thine handmaid; thou hast broken my bonds in sunder.\
15 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, \* and will call
upon the Name of the LORD.\
16 I will pay my vows unto the LORD, in the sight of all his people, \*
in the courts of the LORD\'S house; even in the midst of thee, O
Jerusalem. Praise the LORD.\

**Psalm 117. Laudate Dominum.**\
O PRAISE the LORD, all ye nations; \* praise him, all ye peoples.\
2 For his merciful kindness is ever more and more toward us; \* and the
truth of the LORD endureth for ever. Praise the LORD.\

**Psalm 118. Confitemini Domino.**\
O GIVE thanks unto the LORD, for he is gracious; \* because his mercy
endureth for ever.\
2 Let Israel now confess that he is gracious, \* and that his mercy
endureth for ever.\
3 Let the house of Aaron now confess, \* that his mercy endureth for
ever.\
4 Yea, let them now that fear the LORD confess, \* that his mercy
endureth for ever.\
5 I called upon the LORD in trouble; \* and the LORD heard me at large.\
6 The LORD is on my side; \* I will not fear what man doeth unto me.\
7 The LORD taketh my part with them that help me; \* therefore shall I
see my desire upon mine enemies.\
8 It is better to trust in the LORD, \* than to put any confidence in
man.\
9 It is better to trust in the LORD, \* than to put any confidence in
princes.\
10 All nations compassed me round about; \* but in the Name of the LORD
will I destroy them.\
11 They kept me in on every side, they kept me in, I say, on every side;
\* but in the Name of the LORD will I destroy them.\
12 They came about me like bees, and are extinct even as the fire among
the thorns; \* for in the Name of the LORD I will destroy them.\
13 Thou hast thrust sore at me, that I might fall; \* but the LORD was
my help.\
14 The LORD is my strength, and my song; \* and is become my salvation.\
15 The voice of joy and health is in the dwellings of the righteous; \*
the right hand of the LORD bringeth mighty things to pass.\
16 The right hand of the LORD hath the pre-eminence; \* the right hand
of the LORD bringeth mighty things to pass.\
17 I shall not die, but live, \* and declare the works of the LORD.\
18 The LORD hath chastened and corrected me; \* but he hath not given me
over unto death.\
19 Open me the gates of righteousness, \* that I may go into them, and
give thanks unto the LORD.\
20 This is the gate of the LORD, \* the righteous shall enter into it.\
21 I will thank thee; for thou hast heard me, \* and art become my
salvation.\
22 The same stone which the builders refused, \* is become the
head-stone in the corner.\
23 This is the LORD\'S doing, \* and it is marvellous in our eyes.\
24 This is the day which the LORD hath made; \* we will rejoice and be
glad in it.\
25 Help me now, O LORD: \* O LORD, send us now prosperity.\
26 Blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the LORD: \* we have wished
you good luck, we that are of the house of the LORD.\
27 God is the LORD, who hath showed us light: \* bind the sacrifice with
cords, yea, even unto the horns of the altar.\
28 Thou art my God, and I will thank thee; \* thou art my God, and I
will praise thee.\
29 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is gracious, \* and his mercy
endureth for ever.
