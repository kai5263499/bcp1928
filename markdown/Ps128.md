| BLESSED are all they that fear the LORD, \* and walk in his ways.\    |
| 2 For thou shalt eat the labours of thine hands: \* O well is thee,   |
| and happy shalt thou be.\                                             |
| 3 Thy wife shall be as the fruitful vine \* upon the walls of thine   |
| house;\                                                               |
| 4 Thy children like the olive-branches \* round about thy table.\     |
| 5 Lo, thus shall the man be blessed \* that feareth the LORD.\        |
| 6 The LORD from out of Sion shall so bless thee, \* that thou shalt   |
| see Jerusalem in prosperity all thy life long;\                       |
| 7 Yea, that thou shalt see thy children\'s children, \* and peace     |
| upon Israel                                                           |
