| 1 Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and    |

| 2 I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same   |

| laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my  |
| fellowlabourers, whose names are in the book of life.\                |
| 4 Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say, Rejoice.\              |
| 5 Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.\    |
| 6 Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and            |
| supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto   |

| and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.\          |

| of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye     |
| lacked opportunity.\                                                  |

| whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.\                      |
| 12 I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every      |
| where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be     |
| hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.\                           |
| 13 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.\        |

| affliction.\                                                          |
| 15 Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, |
| when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as     |
| concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.\                        |
| 16 For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my            |
| necessity.\                                                           |
| 17 Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to |
| your account.\                                                        |
| 18 But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of          |
| Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet |
| smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.\                  |
| 19 But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in   |
| glory by Christ Jesus.\                                               |
| 20 Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.\     |
