| **Psalm 59. Eripe me de inimicis.**\                                  |
| DELIVER me from mine enemies, O God; \* defend me from them that rise |
| up against me.\                                                       |
| 2 O deliver me from the wicked doers, \* and save me from the         |
| blood-thirsty men.\                                                   |
| 3 For lo, they lie waiting for my soul; \* the mighty men are         |
| gathered against me, without any offence or fault of me, O LORD.\     |
| 4 They run and prepare themselves without my fault; \* arise thou     |
| therefore to help me, and behold.\                                    |
| 5 Stand up, O LORD God of hosts, thou God of Israel, to visit all the |
| heathen, \* and be not merciful unto them that offend of malicious    |
| wickedness.\                                                          |
| 6 They go to and fro in the evening, \* they grin like a dog, and run |
| about through the city.\                                              |
| 7 Behold, they speak with their mouth, and swords are in their lips;  |
| \* for who doth hear?\                                                |
| 8 But thou, O LORD, shalt have them in derision, \* and thou shalt    |
| laugh all the heathen to scorn.\                                      |
| 9 My strength will I ascribe unto thee; \* for thou art the God of my |
| refuge.\                                                              |
| 10 God showeth me his goodness plenteously; \* and God shall let me   |
| see my desire upon mine enemies.\                                     |
| 11 Slay them not, lest my people forget it; \* but scatter them       |
| abroad among the people, and put them down, O Lord our defence.\      |
| 12 For the sin of their mouth, and for the words of their lips, they  |
| shall be taken in their pride: \* and why? their talk is of cursing   |
| and lies.\                                                            |
| 13 Consume them in thy wrath, consume them, that they may perish; \*  |
| and know that it is God that ruleth in Jacob, and unto the ends of    |
| the world.\                                                           |
| 14 And in the evening they will return, \* grin like a dog, and will  |
| go about the city.\                                                   |
| 15 They will run here and there for meat, \* and grudge if they be    |
| not satisfied.\                                                       |
| 16 As for me, I will sing of thy power, and will praise thy mercy     |
| betimes in the morning; \* for thou hast been my defence and refuge   |
| in the day of my trouble.\                                            |
| 17 Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing; \* for thou, O God, art my  |
| refuge, and my merciful God.                                          |
