| \                                                                     |

| **Psalm 94. Deus ultionum.**\                                         |
| O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth, \* thou God, to whom         |
| vengeance belongeth, show thyself.\                                   |
| 2 Arise, thou Judge of the world, \* and reward the proud after their |
| deserving.\                                                           |
| 3 LORD, how long shall the ungodly, \* how long shall the ungodly     |
| triumph?\                                                             |
| 4 How long shall all wicked doers speak so disdainfully, \* and make  |
| such proud boasting?\                                                 |
| 5 They smite down thy people, O LORD, \* and trouble thine heritage.\ |
| 6 They murder the widow and the stranger, \* and put the fatherless   |
| to death.\                                                            |
| 7 And yet they say, Tush, the LORD shall not see, \* neither shall    |
| the God of Jacob regard it.\                                          |
| 8 Take heed, ye unwise among the people: \* O ye fools, when will ye  |
| understand?\                                                          |
| 9 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? \* or he that made the  |
| eye, shall he not see?\                                               |
| 10 Or he that instructeth the heathen, \* it is he that teacheth man  |
| knowledge; shall not he punish?\                                      |
| 11 The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, \* that they are but vain.\  |
| 12 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, \* and teachest   |
| him in thy law;\                                                      |
| 13 That thou mayest give him patience in time of adversity, \* until  |
| the pit be digged up for the ungodly.\                                |
| 14 For the LORD will not fail his people; \* neither will he forsake  |
| his inheritance;\                                                     |
| 15 Until righteousness turn again unto judgment: \* all such as are   |
| true in heart shall follow it.\                                       |
| 16 Who will rise up with me against the wicked? \* or who will take   |
| my part against the evil doers?\                                      |
| 17 If the LORD had not helped me, \* it had not failed, but my soul   |
| had been put to silence.\                                             |
| 18 But when I said, My foot hath slipt; \* thy mercy, O LORD, held me |
| up.\                                                                  |
| 19 In the multitude of the sorrows that I had in my heart, \* thy     |
| comforts have refreshed my soul.\                                     |
| 20 Wilt thou have any thing to do with the throne of wickedness, \*   |
| which imagineth mischief as a law?\                                   |
| 21 They gather them together against the soul of the righteous, \*    |
| and condemn the innocent blood.\                                      |
| 22 But the LORD is my refuge, \* and my God is the strength of my     |
| confidence.\                                                          |
| 23 He shall recompense them their wickedness, and destroy them in     |
| their own malice; \* yea, the LORD our God shall destroy them.        |
