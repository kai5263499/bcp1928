**Psalm 62. Nonne Deo?**\
MY soul truly waiteth still upon God; \* for of him cometh my
salvation.\
2 He verily is my strength and my salvation; \* he is my defence, so
that I shall not greatly fall.\
3 How long will ye imagine mischief against every man? \* Ye shall be
slain all the sort of you; yea, as a tottering wall shall ye be, and
like a broken hedge.\
4 Their device is only how to put him out whom God will exalt; \* their
delight is in lies; they give good words with their mouth, but curse
with their heart.\
5 Nevertheless, my soul, wait thou still upon God; \* for my hope is in
him.\
6 He truly is my strength and my salvation; \* he is my defence, so that
I shall not fall.\
7 In God is my health and my glory; \* the rock of my might; and in God
is my trust.\
8 O put your trust in him alway, ye people; \* pour out your hearts
before him, for God is our hope.\
9 As for the children of men, they are but vanity; the children of men
are deceitful; \* upon the weights they are altogether lighter than
vanity itself.\
10 O trust not in wrong and robbery; give not yourselves unto vanity: \*
if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.\
11 God spake once, and twice I have also heard the same, \* that power
belongeth unto God;\
12 And that thou, Lord, art merciful; \* for thou rewardest every man
according to his work.\

**Psalm 63. Deus, Deus meus.**\
O GOD, thou art my God; \* early will I seek thee.\
2 My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh also longeth after thee, \* in a
barren and dry land where no water is.\
3 Thus have I looked for thee in the sanctuary, \* that I might behold
thy power and glory.\
4 For thy loving-kindness is better than the life itself: \* my lips
shall praise thee.\
5 As long as I live will I magnify thee in this manner, \* and lift up
my hands in thy Name.\
6 My soul shall be satisfied, even as it were with marrow and fatness,
\* when my mouth praiseth thee with joyful lips.\
7 Have I not remembered thee in my bed, \* and thought upon thee when I
was waking?\
8 Because thou hast been my helper; \* therefore under the shadow of thy
wings will I rejoice.\
9 My soul hangeth upon thee; \* thy right hand hath upholden me.\
10 These also that seek the hurt of my soul, \* they shall go under the
earth.\
11 Let them fall upon the edge of the sword, \* that they may be a
portion for foxes.\
12 But the King shall rejoice in God; all they also that swear by him
shall be commended; \* for the mouth of them that speak lies shall be
stopped.\

**Psalm 64. Exaudi, Deus.**\
HEAR my voice, O God, in my prayer; \* preserve my life from fear of the
enemy.\
2 Hide me from the gathering together of the froward, \* and from the
insurrection of wicked doers;\
3 Who have whet their tongue like a sword, \* and shoot out their
arrows, even bitter words;\
4 That they may privily shoot at him that is perfect: \* suddenly do
they hit him, and fear not.\
5 They encourage themselves in mischief, \* and commune among
themselves, how they may lay snares; and say, that no man shall see
them.\
6 They imagine wickedness, and practise it; \* that they keep secret
among themselves, every man in the deep of his heart.\
7 But God shall suddenly shoot at them with a swift arrow, \* that they
shall be wounded.\
8 Yea, their own tongues shall make them fall; \* insomuch that whoso
seeth them shall laugh them to scorn.\
9 And all men that see it shall say, This hath God done; \* for they
shall perceive that it is his work.\
10 The righteous shall rejoice in the LORD, and put his trust in him; \*
and all they that are true of heart shall be glad.
