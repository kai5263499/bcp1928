| **Psalm 111. Confitebor tibi.**\                                      |
| I WILL give thanks unto the LORD with my whole heart, \* secretly     |
| among the faithful, and in the congregation.\                         |
| 2 The works of the LORD are great, \* sought out of all them that     |
| have pleasure therein.\                                               |
| 3 His work is worthy to be praised and had in honour, \* and his      |
| righteousness endureth for ever.\                                     |
| 4 The merciful and gracious LORD hath so done his marvellous works,   |
| \* that they ought to be had in remembrance.\                         |
| 5 He hath given meat unto them that fear him; \* he shall ever be     |
| mindful of his covenant.\                                             |
| 6 He hath showed his people the power of his works, \* that he may    |
| give them the heritage of the heathen.\                               |
| 7 The works of his hands are verity and judgment; \* all his          |
| commandments are true.\                                               |
| 8 They stand fast for ever and ever, \* and are done in truth and     |
| equity.\                                                              |
| 9 He sent redemption unto his people; \* he hath commanded his        |
| covenant for ever; holy and reverend is his Name.\                    |
| 10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; \* a good         |
| understanding have all they that do thereafter; his praise endureth   |
| for ever.                                                             |
