**Psalm 24. Domini est terra.**\
THE earth is the LORD\'S, and all that therein is; \* the compass of the
world, and they that dwell therein.\
2 For he hath founded it upon the seas, \* and stablished it upon the
floods.\
3 Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? \* or who shall rise up in
his holy place?\
4 Even he that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; \* and that hath not
lift up his mind unto vanity, nor sworn to deceive his neighbour.\
5 He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, \* and righteousness from
the God of his salvation.\
6 This is the generation of them that seek him; \* even of them that
seek thy face, O God of Jacob.\
7 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting
doors; \* and the King of glory shall come in.\
8 Who is this King of glory? \* It is the LORD strong and mighty, even
the LORD mighty in battle.\
9 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting
doors; \* and the King of glory shall come in.\
10 Who is this King of glory? \* Even the LORD of hosts, he is the King
of glory.\

**Psalm 25. Ad te, Domine, levavi.**\
UNTO thee, O LORD, will I lift up my soul; my God, I have put my trust
in thee: \* O let me not be confounded, neither let mine enemies triumph
over me.\
2 For all they that hope in thee shall not be ashamed; \* but such as
transgress without a cause shall be put to confusion.\
3 Show me thy ways, O LORD, \* and teach me thy paths.\
4 Lead me forth in thy truth, and learn me: \* for thou art the God of
my salvation; in thee hath been my hope all the day long.\
5 Call to remembrance, O LORD, thy tender mercies, \* and thy
loving-kindnesses, which have been ever of old.\
6 O remember not the sins and offences of my youth; \* but according to
thy mercy think thou upon me, O LORD, for thy goodness.\
7 Gracious and righteous is the LORD; \* therefore, will he teach
sinners in the way.\
8 Them that are meek shall he guide in judgment; \* and such as are
gentle, them shall he learn his way.\
9 All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth, \* unto such as keep
his covenant and his testimonies.\
10 For thy Name\'s sake, O LORD, \* be merciful unto my sin; for it is
great.\
11 What man is he that feareth the LORD? \* him shall he teach in the
way that he shall choose.\
12 His soul shall dwell at ease, \* and his seed shall inherit the
land.\
13 The secret of the LORD is among them that fear him; \* and he will
show them his covenant.\
14 Mine eyes are ever looking unto the LORD; \* for he shall pluck my
feet out of the net.\
15 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; \* for I am desolate, and
in misery.\
16 The sorrows of my heart are enlarged: \* O bring thou me out of my
troubles.\
17 Look upon my adversity and misery, \* and forgive me all my sin.\
18 Consider mine enemies, how many they are; \* and they bear a
tyrannous hate against me.\
19 O keep my soul, and deliver me: \* let me not be confounded, for I
have put my trust in thee.\
20 Let perfectness and righteous dealing wait upon me; \* for my hope
hath been in thee.\
21 Deliver Israel, O God, \* out of all his troubles.\

**Psalm 26. Judica me, Domine.**\
BE thou my Judge, O LORD, for I have walked innocently: \* my trust hath
been also in the LORD, therefore shall I not fall.\
2 Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; \* try out my reins and my heart.\
3 For thy loving-kindness is ever before mine eyes; \* and I will walk
in thy truth.\
4 I have not dwelt with vain persons; \* neither will I have fellowship
with the deceitful.\
5 I have hated the congregation of the wicked; \* and will not sit among
the ungodly.\
6 I will wash my hands in innocency, O LORD; \* and so will I go to
thine altar;\
7 That I may show the voice of thanksgiving, \* and tell of all thy
wondrous works.\
8 LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, \* and the place where
thine honour dwelleth.\
9 O shut not up my soul with the sinners, \* nor my life with the
blood-thirsty;\
10 In whose hands is wickedness, \* and their right hand is full of
gifts.\
11 But as for me, I will walk innocently: \* O deliver me, and be
merciful unto me.\
12 My foot standeth right: \* I will praise the LORD in the
congregations.
