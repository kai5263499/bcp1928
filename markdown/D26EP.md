**Psalm 119. (Cont)\
XIX. Clamavi in toto corde meo.**\
I CALL with my whole heart; \* hear me, O LORD; I will keep thy
statutes.\
146 Yea, even unto thee do I call; \* help me, and I shall keep thy
testimonies.\
147 Early in the morning do I cry unto thee; \* for in thy word is my
trust.\
148 Mine eyes prevent the night watches; \* that I might be occupied in
thy word.\
149 Hear my voice, O LORD, according unto thy lovingkindness; \* quicken
me, according to thy judgments.\
150 They draw nigh that of malice persecute me, \* and are far from thy
law.\
151 Be thou nigh at hand, O LORD; \* for all thy commandments are true.\
152 As concerning thy testimonies, I have known long since, \* that thou
hast grounded them for ever.\

**XX. Vide humilitatem.**\
O CONSIDER mine adversity, and deliver me, \* for I do not forget thy
law.\
154 Avenge thou my cause, and deliver me; \* quicken me according to thy
word.\
155 Health is far from the ungodly; \* for they regard not thy
statutes.\
156 Great is thy mercy, O LORD; \* quicken me, as thou art wont.\
157 Many there are that trouble me, and persecute me; \* yet do I not
swerve from thy testimonies.\
158 It grieveth me when I see the transgressors; \* because they keep
not thy law.\
159 Consider, O LORD, how I love thy commandments; \* O quicken me,
according to thy loving-kindness.\
160 Thy word is true from everlasting; \* all the judgments of thy
righteousness endure for evermore.\

**XXI. Principes persecuti sunt.**\
PRINCES have persecuted me without a cause; \* but my heart standeth in
awe of thy word.\
162 I am as glad of thy word, \* as one that findeth great spoils.\
163 As for lies, I hate and abhor them; \* but thy law do I love.\
164 Seven times a day do I praise thee; \* because of thy righteous
judgments.\
165 Great is the peace that they have who love thy law; \* and they have
none occasion of stumbling.\
166 LORD, I have looked for thy saving health, \* and done after thy
commandments.\
167 My soul hath kept thy testimonies, \* and loved them exceedingly.\
168 I have kept thy commandments and testimonies; \* for all my ways are
before thee.\

**XXII. Appropinquet deprecatio.**\
LET my complaint come before thee, O LORD; \* give me understanding
according to thy word.\
170 Let my supplication come before thee; \* deliver me according to thy
word.\
171 My lips shall speak of thy praise, \* when thou hast taught me thy
statutes.\
172 Yea, my tongue shall sing of thy word; \* for all thy commandments
are righteous.\
173 Let thine hand help me; \* for I have chosen thy commandments.\
174 I have longed for thy saving health, O LORD; \* and in thy law is my
delight.\
175 O let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; \* and thy judgments
shall help me.\
176 I have gone astray like a sheep that is lost; \* O seek thy servant,
for I do not forget thy commandments.
