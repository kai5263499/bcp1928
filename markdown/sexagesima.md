| morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned.\     |

| 1 It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to       |
| visions and revelations of the Lord.\                                 |
| []{#anchor320354}2 I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago,   |
| (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I    |
| cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third         |

| cannot tell: God knoweth;)\                                           |
| 4 How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable      |
| words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.\                    |
| 5 Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in |
| mine infirmities.\                                                    |
| 6 For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I    |
| will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of   |
| me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.\     |
| []{#anchor322957}7 And lest I should be exalted above measure through |
| the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in    |

| exalted above measure.\                                               |

| from me.\                                                             |
| 9 And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my        |
| strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I    |
| rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest     |
| upon me.\                                                             |
| []{#anchor325204}10 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in      |
| reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for        |
| Christ\'s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.\                |
| 11 I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought  |
| to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very    |
| chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.\                              |

| 22 For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a         |
| bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.\                                  |
| 23 But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he   |
| of the freewoman was by promise.\                                     |
| 24 Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the |
| one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.\ |
| 25 For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem |
| which now is, and is in bondage with her children.\                   |
| 26 But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us    |
| all.\                                                                 |
| 27 For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break    |
| forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many   |
| more children than she which hath an husband.\                        |
| 28 Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.\      |
| 29 But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that   |
| was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.\                        |
| 30 Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and  |
| her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son  |
| of the freewoman.\                                                    |

| 11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed      |
| east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.\          |
| 12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities |
| of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.\                     |
| 13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD       |
| exceedingly.\                                                         |
| 14 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from    |
| him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art   |
| northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:\                |
| 15 For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to  |
| thy seed for ever.\                                                   |
| 16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a    |
| man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be     |
| numbered.\                                                            |
| 17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the        |
| breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.\                         |
| 18 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of    |
| Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.\   |

| love serve one another.\                                              |
