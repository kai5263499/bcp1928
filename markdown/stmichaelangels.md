| O EVERLASTING God, who hast ordained and constituted the services of  |
| Angels and men in a wonderful order; Mercifully grant that, as thy    |
| holy Angels always do thee service in heaven, so, by thy appointment, |
| they may succour and defend us on earth; through Jesus Christ our     |
| Lord. Amen.\                                                          |
|                                                                       |
| For the Epistle. Revelation xii. 7.                                   |
|                                                                       |
| THERE was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the    |
| dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed not;      |
| neither was their place found any more in heaven. And the great       |
| dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan,   |
| which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and  |
| his angels were cast out with him. And I heard a loud voice saying in |
| heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our   |
| God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is  |
| cast down, which accused them before our God day and night. And they  |
| overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their       |
| testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. Therefore   |
| rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters |
| of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you,     |
| having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short       |
| time.\                                                                |
|                                                                       |
| The Gospel. St. Matthew xviii. 1.                                     |
|                                                                       |
| AT the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the    |
| greatest in the kingdom of heaven? And Jesus called a little child    |
| unto him, and set him in the midst of them, and said, Verily I say    |
| unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye   |
| shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever therefore shall |
| humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the      |
| kingdom of heaven. And whoso shall receive one such little child in   |
| my name receiveth me. But whoso shall offend one of these little ones |
| which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were     |
| hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the   |
| sea. Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be     |
| that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!   |
| Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast |
| them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or      |
| maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into      |
| everlasting fire. And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and     |
| cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one  |
| eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell-fire. Take heed |
| that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you,     |
| That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father    |
| which is in heaven.                                                   |
|                                                                       |

|                                                                       |
