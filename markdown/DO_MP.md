| Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be alway   |
| acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength and my redeemer. Psalm   |
| xix. 14.\                                                             |
| \                                                                     |
| O send out thy light and thy truth, that they may lead me, and bring  |
| me unto thy holy hill, and to thy dwelling. Psalm xliii. 3.\          |
| \                                                                     |
| Thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose     |
| name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that  |
| is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the       |
| humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones. Isaiah Ivii.    |
| 15.\                                                                  |
| \                                                                     |
| The hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship  |

| worship him. St. John iv. 23.                                         |
|                                                                       |
| ¶ then follows,                                                       |
|                                                                       |
| O Lord, open thou our lips.\                                          |

|                                                                       |
| ¶ then follows,                                                       |
|                                                                       |
| **Venite, exultemus Domino.**\                                        |

| strength of our salvation.\                                           |
| Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving; \* and show        |
| ourselves glad in him with psalms.\                                   |
| For the LORD is a great God; \* and a great King above all gods.\     |
| In his hand are all the corners of the earth; \* and the strength of  |
| the hills is his also.\                                               |
| The sea is his, and he made it; \* and his hands prepared the dry     |
| land.\                                                                |
| O come, let us worship and fall down, \* and kneel before the LORD    |
| our Maker.\                                                           |
| For he is the Lord our God; \* and we are the people of his pasture,  |
| and the sheep of his hand.\                                           |
| O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness; \* let the whole earth  |
| stand in awe of him.\                                                 |
| For he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth; \* and with          |
| righteousness to judge the world, and the peoples with his truth.\    |
| Glory be.\                                                            |
