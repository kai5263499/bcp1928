| ######  *¶ At the day and time appointed for                          |
| Solemnization of Matrimony, the Persons to be married shall come into |
|  the body of the Church, or shall be ready in some proper house, with |
|  their friends and neighbours; and there standing together, the Man o |
| n the right hand, and the Woman on the left, the Minister shall say,* |
|                                                                       |
| \                                                                     |
| DEARLY beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God,    |
| and in the face of this company, to join together this Man and this   |
| Woman in holy Matrimony; which is an honourable estate, instituted of |
| God, signifying unto us the mystical union that is betwixt Christ and |
| his Church: which holy estate Christ adorned and beautified with his  |
| presence and first miracle that he wrought in Cana of Galilee, and is |
| commended of Saint Paul to be honourable among all men: and therefore |
| is not by any to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly; but          |
| reverently, discreetly, advisedly, soberly, and in the fear of God.   |
| Into this holy estate these two persons present come now to be        |
| joined. If any man can show just cause, why they may not lawfully be  |
| joined together, let him now speak, or else hereafter for ever hold   |
| his peace.                                                            |
|                                                                       |
| ###### * ¶ And                                                        |
|  also speaking unto the Persons who are to be married, he shall say,* |
|                                                                       |
| \                                                                     |
| I REQUIRE and charge you both, as ye will answer at the dreadful day  |
| of judgment when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed, that   |
| if either of you know any impediment, why ye may not be lawfully      |
| joined together in Matrimony, ye do now confess it. For be ye well    |
| assured, that if any persons are joined together otherwise than as    |
| God\'s Word doth allow, their marriage is not lawful.                 |
|                                                                       |
| ###### *¶ The Minister, if he shall                                   |
| have reason to doubt of the lawfulness of the proposed Marriage, may  |
| demand sufficient surety for his indemnification: but if no impedimen |
| t shall be alleged, or suspected, the Minister shall say to the Man,* |
|                                                                       |

| N. WILT thou have this Woman to thy wedded wife, to live together     |
| after God\'s ordinance in the holy estate of Matrimony? Wilt thou     |
| love her, comfort her, honour, and keep her in sickness and in        |
| health; and, forsaking all others, keep thee only unto her, so long   |
| as ye both shall live?                                                |
|                                                                       |
| *¶ The Man shall answer,*                                             |
|                                                                       |

| I will.                                                               |

| *¶ Then shall the Minister say unto the Woman,*                       |
|                                                                       |
