**Psalm 108. Paratum cor meum.**\
O GOD, my heart is ready, my heart is ready; \* I will sing, and give
praise with the best member that I have.\
2 Awake, thou lute and harp; \* I myself will awake right early.\
3 I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the peoples; \* I will
sing praises unto thee among the nations.\
4 For thy mercy is greater than the heavens, \* and thy truth reacheth
unto the clouds.\
5 Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens, \* and thy glory above all
the earth;\
6 That thy beloved may be delivered: \* let thy right hand save them,
and hear thou me.\
7 God hath spoken in his holiness; \* I will rejoice therefore, and
divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.\
8 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; \* Ephraim also is the strength
of my head; Judah is my lawgiver;\
9 Moab is my wash-pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; \* upon
Philistia will I triumph.\
10 Who will lead me into the strong city? \* and who will bring me into
Edom?\
11 Hast not thou forsaken us, O God? \* and wilt not thou, O God, go
forth with our hosts?\
12 O help us against the enemy: \* for vain is the help of man.\
13 Through God we shall do great acts; \* and it is he that shall tread
down our enemies.\

**Psalm 109. Deus, laudem.**\
HOLD not thy tongue, O God of my praise; \* for the mouth of the
ungodly, yea, the mouth of the deceitful is opened upon me.\
2 And they have spoken against me with false tongues; \* they compassed
me about also with words of hatred, and fought against me without a
cause.\
3 For the love that I had unto them, lo, they take now my contrary part;
\* but I give myself unto prayer.\
4 Thus have they rewarded me evil for good, \* and hatred for my good
will.\
5 Set thou an ungodly man to be ruler over him, \* and let an adversary
stand at his right hand.\
6 When sentence is given upon him, let him be condemned; \* and let his
prayer be turned into sin.\
7 Let his days be few; \* and let another take his office.\
8 Let his children be fatherless, \* and his wife a widow.\
9 Let his children be vagabonds, and beg their bread; \* let them seek
it also out of desolate places.\
10 Let the extortioner consume all that he hath; \* and let the stranger
spoil his labour.\
11 Let there be no man to pity him, \* nor to have compassion upon his
fatherless children.\
12 Let his posterity be destroyed; \* and in the NEXT

generation let his name be clean put out.\
13 Let the wickedness of his fathers be had in remembrance in the sight
of the LORD; \* and let not the sin of his mother be done away.\
14 Let them alway be before the LORD, \* that he may root out the
memorial of them from off the earth;\
15 And that, because his mind was not to do good; \* but persecuted the
poor helpless man, that he might slay him that was vexed at the heart.\
16 His delight was in cursing, and it shall happen unto him; \* he loved
not blessing, therefore shall it be far from him.\
17 He clothed himself with cursing like as with a raiment, \* and it
shall come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.\
18 Let it be unto him as the cloak that he hath upon him, \* and as the
girdle that he is alway girded withal.\
19 Let it thus happen from the LORD unto mine enemies, \* and to those
that speak evil against my soul.\
20 But deal thou with me, O LORD God, according unto thy Name; \* for
sweet is thy mercy.\
21 O deliver me, for I am helpless and poor, \~ and my heart is wounded
within me.\
22 I go hence like the shadow that departeth, \* and am driven away as
the grasshopper.\
23 My knees are weak through fasting; \* my flesh is dried up for want
of fatness.\
24 I am become also a reproach unto them: \* they that look upon me
shake their heads.\
25 Help me, O LORD my God; \* O save me according to thy mercy;\
26 And they shall know how that this is thy hand, \* and that thou,
LORD, hast done it.\
27 Though they curse, yet bless thou; \* and let them be confounded that
rise up against me; but let thy servant rejoice.\
28 Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame; \* and let them cover
themselves with their own confusion, as with a cloak.\
29 As for me, I will give great thanks unto the LORD with my mouth, \*
and praise him among the multitude;\
30 For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, \* to save his soul
from unrighteous judges.
