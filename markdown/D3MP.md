**Psalm 15. Domine, quis habitabit?**\
LORD, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? \* or who shall rest upon thy
holy hill?\
2 Even he that leadeth an uncorrupt life, \* and doeth the thing which
is right, and speaketh the truth from his heart.\
3 He that hath used no deceit in his tongue, nor done evil to his
neighbour, \* and hath not slandered his neighbour.\
4 He that setteth not by himself, but is lowly in his own eyes, \* and
maketh much of them that fear the LORD.\
5 He that sweareth unto his neighbour, and disappointeth him not, \*
though it were to his own hindrance.\
6 He that hath not given his money upon usury, \* nor taken reward
against the innocent.\
7 Whoso doeth these things \* shall never fall.\

**Psalm 16. Conserva me, Domine.**\
PRESERVE me, O God; \* for in thee have I put my trust.\
2 O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, \* Thou art my God; I have no
good like unto thee.\
3 All my delight is upon the saints that are in the earth, \* and upon
such as excel in virtue.\
4 But they that run after another god \* shall have great trouble.\
5 Their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, \* neither make
mention of their names within my lips.\
6 The LORD himself is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup; \*
thou shalt maintain my lot.\
7 The lot is fallen unto me in a fair ground; \* yea, I have a goodly
heritage.\
8 I will thank the LORD for giving me warning; \* my reins also chasten
me in the night season.\
9 I have set the LORD alway before me; \* for he is on my right hand,
therefore I shall not fall.\
10 Wherefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: \* my flesh also
shall rest in hope.\
11 For why? thou shalt not leave my soul in hell; \* neither shalt thou
suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.\
12 Thou shalt show me the path of life: in thy presence is the fulness
of joy, \* and at thy right hand there is pleasure for evermore.\

**Psalm 17. Exaudi, Domine.**\
HEAR the right, O LORD, consider my complaint, \* and hearken unto my
prayer, that goeth not out-of feigned lips.\
2 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; \* and let thine eyes
look upon the thing that is equal.\
3 Thou hast proved and visited mine heart in the night season; thou hast
tried me, and shalt find no wickedness in me; \* for I am utterly
purposed that my mouth shall not offend.\
4 As for the works of men, \* by the word of thy lips I have kept me
from the ways of the destroyer.\
5 O hold thou up my goings in thy paths, \* that my footsteps slip not.\
6 I have called upon thee, O God, for thou shalt hear me: \* incline
thine ear to me, and hearken unto my words.\
7 Show thy marvellous loving-kindness, thou that art the Saviour of them
which put their trust in thee, \* from such as resist thy right hand.\
8 Keep me as the apple of an eye; \* hide me under the shadow of thy
wings,\
9 From the ungodly, that trouble me; \* mine enemies compass me round
about, to take away my soul.\
10 They are inclosed in their own fat, \* and their mouth speaketh proud
things.\
11 They lie waiting in our way on every side, \* watching to cast us
down to the ground;\
12 Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, \* and as it were a
lion\'s whelp lurking in secret places.\
13 Up, LORD, disappoint him, and cast him down; \* deliver my soul from
the ungodly, by thine own sword;\
14 Yea, by thy hand, O LORD; from the men of the evil world; \* which
have their portion in this life, whose bellies thou fillest with thy hid
treasure.\
15 They have children at their desire, \* and leave the rest of their
substance for their babes.\
16 But as for me, I shall behold thy presence in righteousness; \* and
when I awake up after thy likeness, I shall be satisfied.
