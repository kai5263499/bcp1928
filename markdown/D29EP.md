**Psalm 141. Domine, clamavi.**\
LORD, I call upon thee; haste thee unto me, \* and consider my voice,
when I cry unto thee.\
2 Let my prayer be set forth in thy sight as the incense; \* and let the
lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice.\
3 Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth, \* and keep the door of my
lips.\
4 O let not mine heart be inclined to any evil thing; \* let me not be
occupied in ungodly works with the men that work wickedness, neither let
me eat of such things as please them.\
5 Let the righteous rather smite me friendly, and reprove me; \* yea,
let not my head refuse their precious balms.\
6 As for the ungodly, \* I will pray yet against their wickedness.\
7 Let their judges be overthrown in stony places, \* that they may hear
my words; for they are sweet.\
8 Our bones lie scattered before the pit, \* like as when one breaketh
and heweth wood upon the earth.\
9 But mine eyes look unto thee, O LORD God; \* in thee is my trust; O
cast not out my soul.\
10 Keep me from the snare that they have laid for me, \* and from the
traps of the wicked doers.\
11 Let the ungodly fall into their own nets together, \* and let me ever
escape them.\

**Psalm 142. Voce mea ad Dominum.**\
I CRIED unto the LORD with my voice; \* yea, even unto the LORD did I
make my supplication.\
2 I poured out my complaints before him, \* and showed him of my
trouble.\
3 When my spirit was in heaviness, thou knewest my path; \* in the way
wherein I walked, have they privily laid a snare for me.\
4 I looked also upon my right hand, \* and saw there was no man that
would know me.\
5 I had no place to flee unto, \* and no man cared for my soul.\
6 I cried unto thee, O LORD, and said, \* Thou art my hope, and my
portion in the land of the living.\
7 Consider my complaint; \* for I am brought very low.\
8 O deliver me from my persecutors; \* for they are too strong for me.\
9 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks unto thy Name; \*
which thing if thou wilt grant me, then shall the righteous resort unto
my company.\

**Psalm 143. Domine, exaudi.**\
HEAR my prayer, O LORD, and consider my desire; \* hearken unto me for
thy truth and righteousness\' sake.\
2 And enter not into judgment with thy servant; \* for in thy sight
shall no man living be justified.\
3 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to
the ground; \* he hath laid me in the darkness, as the men that have
been long dead.\
4 Therefore is my spirit vexed within me, \* and my heart within me is
desolate.\
5 Yet do I remember the time past; I muse upon all thy works; \* yea, I
exercise myself in the works of thy hands.\
6 I stretch forth my hands unto thee; \* my soul gaspeth unto thee as a
thirsty land.\
7 Hear me, O LORD, and that soon; for my spirit waxeth faint: \* hide
not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the
pit.\
8 O let me hear thy loving-kindness betimes in the morning; for in thee
is my trust: \* show thou me the way that I should walk in; for I lift
up my soul unto thee.\
9 Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies; \* for I flee unto thee to hide
me.\
10 Teach me to do the thing that pleaseth thee; for thou art my God: \*
let thy loving Spirit lead me forth into the land of righteousness.\
11 Quicken me, O LORD, for thy Name\'s sake; \* and for thy
righteousness\' sake bring my soul out of trouble.\
12 And of thy goodness slay mine enemies, \* and destroy all them that
vex my soul; for I am thy servant.
