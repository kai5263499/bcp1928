**Psalm 38. Domine, ne in furore.**\
PUT me not to rebuke, O LORD, in thine anger; \* neither chasten me in
thy heavy displeasure:\
2 For thine arrows stick fast in me, \* and thy hand presseth me sore.\
3 There is no health in my flesh, because of thy displeasure; \* neither
is there any rest in my bones, by reason of my sin.\
4 For my wickednesses are gone over my head, \* and are like a sore
burden, too heavy for me to bear.\
5 My wounds stink, and are corrupt, \* through my foolishness.\
6 I am brought into so great trouble and misery, \* that I go mourning
all the day long.\
7 For my loins are filled with a sore disease, \* and there is no whole
part in my body.\
8 I am feeble and sore smitten; \* I have roared for the very
disquietness of my heart.\
9 Lord, thou knowest all my desire; \* and my groaning is not hid from
thee.\
10 My heart panteth, my strength hath failed me, \* and the light of
mine eyes is gone from me.\
11 My lovers and my neighbours did stand looking upon my trouble, \* and
my kinsmen stood afar off.\
12 They also that sought after my life laid snares for me; \* and they
that went about to do me evil talked of wickedness, and imagined deceit
all the day long.\
13 As for me, I was like a deaf man, and heard not; \* and as one that
is dumb, who doth not open his mouth.\
14 I became even as a man that heareth not, \* and in whose mouth are no
reproofs.\
15 For in thee, O LORD, have I put my trust; \* thou shalt answer for
me, O Lord my God.\
16 I have required that they, even mine enemies, should not triumph over
me; \* for when my foot slipt, they rejoiced greatly against me.\
17 And I truly am set in the plague, \* and my heaviness is ever in my
sight.\
18 For I will confess my wickedness, \* and be sorry for my sin.\
19 But mine enemies live, and are mighty; \* and they that hate me
wrongfully are many in number.\
20 They also that reward evil for good are against me; \* because I
follow the thing that good is.\
21 Forsake me not, O LORD my God; \* be not thou far from me.\

**Psalm 39. Dixi, Custodiam.**\
I SAID, I will take heed to my ways, \* that I offend not in my tongue\
2 I will keep my mouth as it were with a bridle, \* while the ungodly is
in my sight.\
3 I held my tongue, and spake nothing: \* I kept silence, yea, even from
good words; but it was pain and grief to me.\
4 My heart was hot within me: and while I was thus musing the fire
kindled, \* and at the last I spake with my tongue:\
5 LORD, let me know mine end, and the number of my days; \* that I may
be certified how long I have to live.\
6 Behold, thou hast made my days as it were a span long, and mine age is
even as nothing in respect of thee; \* and verily every man living is
altogether vanity.\
7 For man walketh in a vain shadow, and disquieteth himself in vain; \*
he heapeth up riches, and cannot tell who shall gather them.\
8 And now, Lord, what is my hope? \* truly my hope is even in thee.\
9 Deliver me from all mine offences; \* and make me not a rebuke unto
the foolish.\
10 I became dumb, and opened not my mouth; \* for it was thy doing.\
11 Take thy plague away from me: \* I am even consumed by the means of
thy heavy hand.\
12 When thou with rebukes dost chasten man for sin, thou makest his
beauty to consume away, like as it were a moth fretting a garment: \*
every man therefore is but vanity.\
13 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and with thine ears consider my calling; \*
hold not thy peace at my tears;\
14 For I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, \* as all my fathers
were.\
15 O spare me a little, that I may recover my strength, \* before I go
hence, and be no more seen.\

**Psalm 40. Expectans expectavi.**\
I WAITED patiently for the LORD, \* and he inclined unto me, and heard
my calling.\
2 He brought me also out of the horrible pit, out of the mire and clay,
\* and set my feet upon the rock, and ordered my goings.\
3 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, \* even a thanksgiving unto
our God.\
4 Many shall see it, and fear, \* and shall put their trust in the
LORD.\
5 Blessed is the man that hath set his hope in the LORD, \* and turned
not unto the proud, and to such as go about with lies.\
6 O LORD my God, great are the wondrous works which thou hast done, like
as be also thy thoughts, which are to us-ward; \* and yet there is no
man that ordereth them unto thee.\
7 If I should declare them, and speak of them, \* they should be more
than I am able to express.\
8 Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, \* but mine ears hast thou
opened.\
9 Burnt-offering and sacrifice for sin hast thou not required: \* then
said I, LO, I come;\
10 In the volume of the book it is written of me, that I should fulfil
thy will, O my God: \* I am content to do it; yea, thy law is within my
heart.\
11 I have declared thy righteousness in the great congregation: \* lo, I
will not refrain my lips, O LORD, and that thou knowest.\
12 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; \* my talk hath
been of thy truth, and of thy salvation.\
13 I have not kept back thy loving mercy and truth \* from the great
congregation.\
14 Withdraw not thou thy mercy from me, O LORD; \* let thy
loving-kindness and thy truth alway preserve me.\
15 For innumerable troubles are come about me; my sins have taken such
hold upon me, that I am not able to look up; \* yea, they are more in
number than the hairs of my head, and my heart hath failed me.\
16 O LORD, let it be thy pleasure to deliver me; \* make haste, O LORD,
to help me.\
17 Let them be ashamed, and confounded together, that seek after my soul
to destroy it; \* let them be driven backward, and put to rebuke, that
wish me evil.\
18 Let them be desolate, and rewarded with shame, \* that say unto me,
Fie upon thee! fie upon thee!\
19 Let all those that seek thee, be joyful and glad in thee; \* and let
such as love thy salvation, say alway, The LORD be praised.\
20 As for me, I am poor and needy; \* but the Lord careth for me.\
21 Thou art my helper and redeemer; \* make no long tarrying, O my God.
