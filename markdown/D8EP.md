**Psalm 41. Beatus qui intelligit.**\
BLESSED is he that considereth the poor and needy; \* the LORD shall
deliver him in the time of trouble.\
2 The LORD preserve him, and keep him alive, that he may be blessed upon
earth; \* and deliver not thou him into the will of his enemies.\
3 The LORD comfort him when he lieth sick upon his bed; \* make thou all
his bed in his sickness.\
4 I said, LORD, be merciful unto me; \* heal my soul, for I have sinned
against thee.\
5 Mine enemies speak evil of me, \* When shall he die, and his name
perish?\
6 And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity, \* and his heart
conceiveth falsehood within himself; and when he cometh forth, he
telleth it.\
7 All mine enemies whisper together against me; \* even against me do
they imagine this evil.\
8 An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him; \* and now that he
lieth, he shall rise up no more.\
9 Yea, even mine own familiar friend whom I trusted, \* who did also eat
of my bread, hath laid great wait for me.\
10 But be thou merciful unto me, O LORD; \* raise thou me up again, and
I shall reward them.\
11 By this I know thou favourest me, \* that mine enemy doth not triumph
against me.\
12 And in my innocency thou upholdest me, \* and shalt set me before thy
face for ever.\
13 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, \* world without end. Amen.

**Psalm 42. Quemadmodum.**\
LIKE as the hart desireth the water-brooks, \* so longeth my soul after
thee, O God.\
2 My soul is athirst for God, yea, even for the living God: \* when
shall I come to appear before the presence of God?\
3 My tears have been my meat day and night, \* while they daily say unto
me, Where is now thy God?\
4 Now when I think thereupon, I pour out my heart by myself; \* for I
went with the multitude, and brought them forth into the house of God;\
5 In the voice of praise and thanksgiving, \* among such as keep
holy-day.\
6 Why art thou so full of heaviness, O my soul? \* and why art thou so
disquieted within me?\
7 O put thy trust in God; \* for I will yet thank him, which is the help
of my countenance, and my God.\
8 My soul is vexed within me; \* therefore will I remember thee from the
land of Jordan, from Hermon and the little hill.\
9 One deep calleth another, because of the noise of thy water-floods; \*
all thy waves and storms are gone over me.\
10 The LORD will grant his loving-kindness in the daytime; \* and in the
night season will I sing of him, and make my prayer unto the God of my
life.\
11 I will say unto the God of my strength, Why hast thou forgotten me?
\* why go I thus heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?\
12 My bones are smitten asunder as with a sword, \* while mine enemies
that trouble me cast me in the teeth;\
13 Namely, while they say daily unto me, \* Where is now thy God?\
14 Why art thou so vexed, O my soul? \* and why art thou so disquieted
within me?\
15 O put thy trust in God; \* for I will yet thank him, which is the
help of my countenance, and my God.\

**Psalm 43. Judica me, Deus.**\
GIVE sentence with me, O God, and defend my cause against the ungodly
people; \* O deliver me from the deceitful and wicked man.\
2 For thou art the God of my strength; why hast thou put me from thee?
\* and why go I so heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?\
3 O send out thy light and thy truth, that they may lead me, \* and
bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy dwelling;\
4 And that I may go unto the altar of God, even unto the God of my joy
and gladness; \* and upon the harp will I give thanks unto thee, O God,
my God.\
5 Why art thou so heavy, O my soul? \* and why art thou so disquieted
within me?\
6 O put thy trust in God; \* for I will yet give him thanks, which is
the help of my countenance, and my God.
