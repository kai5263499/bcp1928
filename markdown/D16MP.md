**Psalm 79. Deus, venerunt.**\
O GOD, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; \* thy holy temple
have they defiled, and made Jerusalem an heap of stones.\
2 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the
fowls of the air, \* and the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the
land.\
3 Their blood have they shed like water on every side of Jerusalem, \*
and there was no man to bury them.\
4 We are become an open shame to our enemies, \* a very scorn and
derision unto them that are round about us.\
5 LORD, how long wilt thou be angry? \* shall thy jealousy burn like
fire for ever?\
6 Pour out thine indignation upon the heathen that have not known thee;
\* and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy Name.\
7 For they have devoured Jacob, \* and laid waste his dwelling-place.\
8 O remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and that soon; \*
for we are come to great misery.\
9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name: \* O
deliver us, and be merciful unto our sins, for thy Name\'s sake.\
10 Wherefore do the heathen say, \* Where is now their God?\
11 O let the vengeance of thy servants\' blood that is shed, \* be
openly showed upon the heathen, in our sight.\
12 O let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before thee; \*
according to the greatness of thy power, preserve thou those that are
appointed to die.\
13 And for the blasphemy wherewith our neighbours have blasphemed thee,
\* reward thou them, O Lord, sevenfold into their bosom.\
14 So we, that are thy people, and sheep of thy pasture, shall give thee
thanks for ever, \* and will alway be showing forth thy praise from
generation to generation.\

**Psalm 80. Qui regis Israel.**\
HEAR, O thou Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock;
\* show thyself also, thou that sittest upon the Cherubim.\
2 Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, \* stir up thy strength, and
come and help us.\
3 Turn us again, O God; \* show the light of thy countenance, and we
shall be whole.\
4 O LORD God of hosts, \* how long wilt thou be angry with thy people
that prayeth?\
5 Thou feedest them with the bread of tears, \* and givest them
plenteousness of tears to drink.\
6 Thou hast made us a very strife unto our neighbours, \* and our
enemies laugh us to scorn.\
7 Turn us again, thou God of hosts; \* show the light of thy
countenance, and we shall be whole.\
8 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt; \* thou hast cast out the
heathen, and planted it.\
9 Thou madest room for it; \* and when it had taken root, it filled the
land.\
10 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, \* and the boughs
thereof were like the goodly cedar-trees.\
11 She stretched out her branches unto the sea, \* and her boughs unto
the River.\
12 Why hast thou then broken down her hedge, \* that all they that go by
pluck off her grapes?\
13 The wild boar out of the wood doth root it up, \* and the wild beasts
of the field devour it.\
14 Turn thee again, thou God of hosts, look down from heaven, \* behold,
and visit this vine;\
15 And the place of the vineyard that thy right hand hath planted, \*
and the branch that thou madest so strong for thyself.\
16 It is burnt with fire, and cut down; \* and they shall perish at the
rebuke of thy countenance.\
17 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, \* and upon the son
of man, whom thou madest so strong for thine own self.\
18 And so will not we go back from thee: \* O let us live, and we shall
call upon thy Name.\
19 Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts; \* show the light of thy
countenance, and we shall be whole.\

**Psalm 81. Exultate Deo.**\
SING we merrily unto God our strength; \* make a cheerful noise unto the
God of Jacob.\
2 Take the psalm, bring hither the tabret, \* the merry harp with the
lute.\
3 Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, \* even in the time appointed,
and upon our solemn feast-day.\
4 For this was made a statute for Israel, \* and a law of the God of
Jacob.\
5 This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, \* when he came out of the
land of Egypt, and had heard a strange language.\
6 I eased his shoulder from the burden, \* and his hands were delivered
from making the pots.\
7 Thou calledst upon me in troubles, and I delivered thee; \* and heard
thee what time as the storm fell upon thee.\
8 I proved thee also \* at the waters of strife.\
9 Hear, O my people; and I will assure thee, O Israel, \* if thou wilt
hearken unto me,\
10 There shall no strange god be in thee, \* neither shalt thou worship
any other god.\
11 I am the LORD thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt: \*
open thy mouth wide, and I shall fill it.\
12 But my people would not hear my voice; \* and Israel would not obey
me;\
13 So I gave them up unto their own hearts\' lusts, \* and let them
follow their own imaginations.\
14 O that my people would have hearkened unto me! \* for if Israel had
walked in my ways,\
15 I should soon have put down their enemies, \* and turned my hand
against their adversaries.\
16 The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him; \*
but their time should have endured for ever.\
17 I would have fed them also with the finest wheatflour; \* and with
honey out of the stony rock would I have satisfied thee.
