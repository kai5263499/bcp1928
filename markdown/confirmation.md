| received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: who,    |
| when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive    |
| the Holy Ghost: for as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they |
| were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Then laid they their     |
| hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.                      |
|                                                                       |
