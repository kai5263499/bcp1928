| **Psalm 112. Beatus vir.**\                                           |
| BLESSED is the man that feareth the LORD; \* he hath great delight in |
| his commandments.\                                                    |
| 2 His seed shall be mighty upon earth; \* the generation of the       |
| faithful shall be blessed.\                                           |
| 3 Riches and plenteousness shall be in his house; \* and his          |
| righteousness endureth for ever.\                                     |
| 4 Unto the godly there ariseth up light in the darkness; \* he is     |
| merciful, loving, and righteous.\                                     |
| 5 A good man is merciful, and lendeth; \* and will guide his words    |
| with discretion.\                                                     |
| 6 For he shall never be moved: \* and the righteous shall be had in   |
| everlasting remembrance.\                                             |
| 7 He will not be afraid of any evil tidings; \* for his heart         |
| standeth fast, and believeth in the LORD.\                            |
| 8 His heart is stablished, and will not shrink, \* until he see his   |
| desire upon his enemies.\                                             |
| 9 He hath dispersed abroad, and given to the poor. \* and his         |
| righteousness remaineth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with      |
| honour.\                                                              |
| 10 The ungodly shall see it, and it shall grieve him; \* he shall     |
| gnash with his teeth, and consume away; the desire of the ungodly     |
| shall perish.                                                         |
