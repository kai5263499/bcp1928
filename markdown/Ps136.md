| O GIVE thanks unto the LORD, for he is gracious: \* and his mercy     |
| endureth for ever.\                                                   |

| 3 O thank the Lord of all lords: \* for his mercy endureth for ever.\ |
| 4 Who only doeth great wonders: \* for his mercy endureth for ever.\  |
| 5 Who by his excellent wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy         |
| endureth for ever.\                                                   |
| 6 Who laid out the earth above the waters: \* for his mercy endureth  |
| for ever.\                                                            |
| 7 Who hath made great lights: \* for his mercy endureth for ever:\    |
| 8 The sun to rule the day: \* for his mercy endureth for ever;\       |
| 9 The moon and the stars to govern the night: \* for his mercy        |
| endureth for ever.\                                                   |
| 10 Who smote Egypt, with their firstborn: \* for his mercy endureth   |
| for ever;\                                                            |
| 11 And brought out Israel from among them: \* for his mercy endureth  |
| for ever;\                                                            |

| endureth for ever.\                                                   |
| 15 But as for Pharaoh and his host, he overthrew them in the Red Sea: |
| \* for his mercy endureth for ever.\                                  |
| 16 Who led his people through the wilderness: \* for his mercy        |
| endureth for ever.\                                                   |

| endureth for ever;\                                                   |

| endureth for ever.\                                                   |
| 23 Who remembered us when we were in trouble: \* for his mercy        |
| endureth for ever;\                                                   |
| 24 And hath delivered us from our enemies: \* for his mercy endureth  |
| for ever.\                                                            |
| 25 Who giveth food to all flesh: \* for his mercy endureth for ever.\ |
