| O GOD, who on the mount didst reveal to chosen witnesses thine        |
| only-begotten Son wonderfully transfigured, in raiment white and      |
| glistering; Mercifully grant that we, being delivered from the        |
| disquietude of this world, may be permitted to behold the King in his |
| beauty, who with thee, O Father, and thee, O Holy Ghost, liveth and   |
| reigneth, one God, world without end. Amen.\                          |
|                                                                       |
| The Epistle. 2 St. Peter i. 13.                                       |
|                                                                       |
| I THINK it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up   |
| by putting you in remembrance; knowing that shortly I must put off    |
| this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.     |
| Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to     |
| have these things always in remembrance. For we have not followed     |
| cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and   |
| coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his         |
| majesty. For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when   |
| there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my   |
| beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. And this voice which came     |
| from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.\       |
|                                                                       |
| The Gospel. St. Luke ix. 28.                                          |
|                                                                       |
| AND it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took  |
| Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray. And as |
| he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his        |
| raiment was white and glistering. And, behold, there talked with him  |
| two men, which were Moses and Elias: who appeared in glory, and spake |
| of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem. But Peter and |
| they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were     |
| awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him. And   |
| it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus,    |
| Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three           |
| tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not  |
| knowing what he said. While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and    |
| overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.    |
| And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved   |
| Son: hear him. And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone.    |
| And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those    |
| things which they had seen.                                           |
