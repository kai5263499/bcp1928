| **Psalm 71. In te, Domine, speravi.**\                                |
| IN thee, O LORD, have I put my trust; let me never be put to          |
| confusion, \* but rid me and deliver me in thy righteousness; incline |
| thine ear unto me, and save me.\                                      |
| 2 Be thou my stronghold, whereunto I may alway resort: \* thou hast   |
| promised to help me, for thou art my house of defence, and my         |
| castle.\                                                              |
| 3 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the ungodly, \* out of the |
| hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.\                               |
| 4 For thou, O Lord GOD, art the thing that I long for: \* thou art my |
| hope, even from my youth.\                                            |
| 5 Through thee have I been holden up ever since I was born: \* thou   |
| art he that took me out of my mother\'s womb: my praise shall be      |
| alway of thee.\                                                       |
| 6 I am become as it were a monster unto many, \* but my sure trust is |
| in thee.\                                                             |
| 7 O let my mouth be filled with thy praise, \* that I may sing of thy |
| glory and honour all the day long.\                                   |
| 8 Cast me not away in the time of age; \* forsake me not when my      |
| strength faileth me.\                                                 |
| 9 For mine enemies speak against me; \* and they that lay wait for my |
| soul take their counsel together, saying,\                            |
| 10 God hath forsaken him; \* persecute him, and take him, for there   |
| is none to deliver him.\                                              |
| 11 Go not far from me, O God; \* my God, haste thee to help me.\      |
| 12 Let them be confounded and perish that are against my soul; \* let |
| them be covered with shame and dishonour that seek to do me evil.\    |
| 13 As for me, I will patiently abide alway, \* and will praise thee   |
| more and more.\                                                       |
| 14 My mouth shall daily speak of thy righteousness and salvation; \*  |
| for I know no end thereof.\                                           |
| 15 I will go forth in the strength of the Lord GOD, \* and will make  |
| mention of thy righteousness only.\                                   |
| 16 Thou, O God, hast taught me from my youth up until now; \*         |
| therefore will I tell of thy wondrous works.\                         |
| 17 Forsake me not, O God, in mine old age, when I am gray-headed, \*  |
| until I have showed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power  |
| to all them that are yet for to come.\                                |
| 18 Thy righteousness, O God, is very high, \* and great things are    |
| they that thou hast done: O God, who is like unto thee!\              |
| 19 O what great troubles and adversities hast thou showed me ! and    |
| yet didst thou turn and refresh me; \* yea, and broughtest me from    |
| the deep of the earth again.\                                         |
| 20 Thou hast brought me to great honour, \* and comforted me on every |
| side:\                                                                |
| 21 Therefore will I praise thee, and thy faithfulness, O God, playing |
| upon an instrument of music: \* unto thee will I sing upon the harp,  |
| O thou Holy One of Israel.\                                           |
| 22 My lips will be glad when I sing unto thee; \* and so will my soul |
| whom thou hast delivered.\                                            |
| 23 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long;   |
| \* for they are confounded and brought unto shame that seek to do me  |
| evil.                                                                 |
