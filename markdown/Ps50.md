| **Psalms 50. Deus deorum.**\                                          |
| THE LORD, even the Most Mighty God, hath spoken, \* and called the    |
| world, from the rising up of the sun unto the going down thereof.\    |
| 2 Out of Sion hath God appeared \* in perfect beauty.\                |
| 3 Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence; \* there shall go   |
| before him a consuming fire, and a mighty tempest shall be stirred up |
| round about him.\                                                     |
| 4 He shall call the heaven from above, \* and the earth, that he may  |
| judge his people.\                                                    |
| 5 Gather my saints together unto me; \* those that have made a        |
| covenant with me with sacrifice.\                                     |
| 6 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness; \* for God is      |
| Judge himself.\                                                       |
| 7 Hear, O my people, and I will speak; \* I myself will testify       |
| against thee, O Israel; for I am God, even thy God.\                  |
| 8 I will not reprove thee because of thy sacrifices; \* as for thy    |
| burnt-offerings, they are alway before me.\                           |
| 9 I will take no bullock out of thine house, \* nor he-goats out of   |
| thy folds.\                                                           |
| 10 For all the beasts of the forest are mine, \* and so are the       |
| cattle upon a thousand hills.\                                        |
| 11 I know all the fowls upon the mountains, \* and the wild beasts of |
| the field are in my sight.\                                           |
| 12 If I be hungry, I will not tell thee; \* for the whole world is    |
| mine, and all that is therein.\                                       |
| 13 Thinkest thou that I will eat bulls\' flesh, \* and drink the      |
| blood of goats?\                                                      |
| 14 Offer unto God thanksgiving, \* and pay thy vows unto the Most     |
| Highest.\                                                             |
| 15 And call upon me in the time of trouble; \* so will I hear thee,   |
| and thou shalt praise me.\                                            |
| 16 But unto the ungodly saith God, \* Why dost thou preach my laws,   |
| and takest my covenant in thy mouth;\                                 |
| 17 Whereas thou hatest to be reformed, \* and hast cast my words      |
| behind thee?\                                                         |
| 18 When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst unto him; \* and hast   |
| been partaker with the adulterers.\                                   |
| 19 Thou hast let thy mouth speak wickedness, \* and with thy tongue   |
| thou hast set forth deceit.\                                          |
| 20 Thou sattest and spakest against thy brother; \* yea, and hast     |
| slandered thine own mother\'s son.\                                   |
| 21 These things hast thou done, and I held my tongue, and thou        |
| thoughtest wickedly, that I am even such a one as thyself; \* but I   |
| will reprove thee, and set before thee the things that thou hast      |
| done.\                                                                |
| 22 O consider this, ye that forget God, \* lest I pluck you away, and |
| there be none to deliver you.\                                        |
| 23 Whoso offereth me thanks and praise, he honoureth me; \* and to    |
| him that ordereth his way aright, will I show the salvation of God.   |
