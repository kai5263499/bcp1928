| faithfulness and truth.\                                              |

| palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.\          |
| 3 Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the     |
| terrible nations shall fear thee.\                                    |
| []{#anchor192783}4 For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a       |
| strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a     |
| shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a     |
| storm against the wall.\                                              |
| 5 Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry  |
| place; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch of the    |
| terrible ones shall be brought low.\                                  |
| 6 And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a |
| feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full |
| of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.\                        |
| 7 And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast  |
| over all people, and the veil that is spread over all nations.\       |
| 8 He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe     |
| away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he  |
| take away from off all the earth: for the LORD hath spoken it.\       |
| 9 And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have      |

| 1 In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day |
| of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the        |
| sepulchre.\                                                           |
| 2 And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the     |
| Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from   |
| the door, and sat upon it.\                                           |
| 3 His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:\ |
| 4 And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.\ |
| 5 And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I  |
| know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.\                        |
| 6 He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place    |
| where the Lord lay.\                                                  |

| dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye   |
| see him: lo, I have told you.\                                        |

| saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and         |
| worshipped him.\                                                      |
| 10 Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that |
| they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.\                   |
| 16 Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain  |

| 13 And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called    |
| Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.\          |
| 14 And they talked together of all these things which had happened.\  |

| 16 But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.\         |
| 17 And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these     |
| that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?\                |
| 18 And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto   |
| him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the    |
| things which are come to pass there in these days?\                   |
| 19 And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him,        |
| Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and  |
| word before God and all the people:\                                  |
| 20 And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be       |
| condemned to death, and have crucified him.\                          |
| 21 But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed      |
| Israel: and beside all this, today is the third day since these       |

| which were early at the sepulchre;\                                   |
| 23 And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had |
| also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.\          |
| 24 And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and  |
| found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.\        |
| 25 Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all  |
| that the prophets have spoken:\                                       |

| them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.\            |
| 28 And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he     |
| made as though he would have gone further.\                           |

| and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.\                         |

| 1 The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit  |
| of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was     |
| full of bones,\                                                       |
| 2 And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were  |
| very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry.\           |
| 3 And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I        |
| answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest.\                                  |

| them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.\                     |
| 5 Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause      |
| breath to enter into you, and ye shall live:\                         |
| 6 And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you,   |
| and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live;    |
| and ye shall know that I am the LORD.\                                |

| and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them.\    |
| 9 Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, |
| and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from the four      |
| winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.\   |

| lost: we are cut off for our parts.\                                  |

| Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come   |
| up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.\        |

| 1 After these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at   |
| the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise showed he himself.\             |
| 2 There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and     |
| Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other  |
| of his disciples.\                                                    |

| immediately; and that night they caught nothing.\                     |

| the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.\                            |
| 5 Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They        |

| and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to |
| draw it for the multitude of fishes.\                                 |
| 7 Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is    |
| the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt    |
| his fisher\'s coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself |
| into the sea.\                                                        |

| far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net   |
| with fishes.\                                                         |

| there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.\                             |
| 10 Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now         |
| caught.\                                                              |
| 11 Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great        |
| fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so     |
| many, yet was not the net broken.\                                    |
| 12 Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples    |
| durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.\           |
| 13 Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish     |

| John 21:15-25**\                                                      |
| 15 So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of  |
| Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord;  |
| thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.\     |
| 16 He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest |
| thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. |
| He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.\                                    |
| 17 He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou |
| me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest |
| thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou    |
| knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.\       |
| 18 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou        |
| girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou   |
| shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall   |
| gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.\                 |
| 19 This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And |
| when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.\               |
| 20 Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved     |
| following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, |
| which is he that betrayeth thee?\                                     |
| 21 Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man     |
| do?\                                                                  |
| 22 Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is |
| that to thee? follow thou me.\                                        |
| 23 Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that         |
| disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not    |
| die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?\ |
| 24 This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote   |
| these things: and we know that his testimony is true.\                |
| 25 And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which,   |
| if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world    |
| itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.\     |
