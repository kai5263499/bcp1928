| 1 For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the     |
| very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they  |
| offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.\  |
| 2 For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the |
| worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.\  |
| 3 But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins   |
| every year.\                                                          |

| LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.\                              |

| may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.\                |
| 23 And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good;  |
| tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word.   |
| So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.\      |
| 24 And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three  |
| bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought   |
| him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young.\   |
| 25 And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.\            |
| 26 And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the    |
| woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.\                |
| 27 For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition    |

| 1 Samuel 16:1-13**\                                                   |
| 1 And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul,   |
| seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn |
| with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I   |
| have provided me a king among his sons.\                              |
| 2 And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me.    |
| And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to    |
| sacrifice to the LORD.\                                               |
| 3 And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou     |
| shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee\    |
| 4 And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem.    |
| And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest   |
| thou peaceably?\                                                      |
| 5 And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD:       |
| sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he        |
| sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.\     |
| 6 And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab,  |
| and said, Surely the LORD\'S anointed is before him.\                 |
| 7 But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on   |
| the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD   |
| seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance,    |
| but the LORD looketh on the heart.\                                   |
| 8 Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he |
| said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.\                             |
| 9 Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the   |
| LORD chosen this.\                                                    |
| 10 Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And     |
| Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.\              |
| 11 And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he      |
| said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the   |
| sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will    |
| not sit down till he come hither.\                                    |
| 12 And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a |
| beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said,      |
| Arise, anoint him: for this is he.\                                   |
| 13 Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of |
| his brethren: and the spirit of the LORD came upon David from that    |
| day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.\                   |

| any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.\        |
| 16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust  |

| 19 They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had    |
| been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went |
| out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.\  |
| 20 But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.\ |
| 21 I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but     |
| because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.\                 |

| 23 Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: \[but\]   |
| he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.\                  |
| 24 Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the      |
| beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall       |
| remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.\ |

| 27 But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you,    |
| and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing     |
| teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as  |
| it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.\                           |
| 28 And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall        |
| appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his  |

| 27 And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus      |
| saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father,    |
| when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh\'s house?\                         |
| 28 And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my      |
| priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod   |

| house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever:   |
| but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I  |
| will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.\     |

| 30 Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, |
| to draw away disciples after them.\                                   |
| 31 Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I  |
| ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.\               |
| 32 And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his    |
| grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance  |
| among all them which are sanctified.\                                 |
| 33 I have coveted no man\'s silver, or gold, or apparel.\             |
| 34 Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my  |
| necessities, and to them that were with me.\                          |
| []{#anchor436595}35 I have shown you all things, how that so          |
| labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of  |
| the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to       |
| receive.\                                                             |
