| **Psalms 9. Confitebor tibi.**\                                       |
| I WILL give thanks unto thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; \* I will  |
| speak of all thy marvellous works.\                                   |
| 2 I will be glad and rejoice in thee; \* yea, my songs will I make of |
| thy Name, O thou Most Highest.\                                       |
| 3 While mine enemies are driven back, \* they shall fall and perish   |
| at thy presence.\                                                     |
| 4 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; \* thou art set in  |
| the throne that judgest right.\                                       |
| 5 Thou hast rebuked the heathen, and destroyed the ungodly; \* thou   |
| hast put out their name for ever and ever.\                           |
| 6 O thou enemy, thy destructions are come to a perpetual end; \* even |
| as the cities which thou hast destroyed, whose memorial is perished   |
| with them.\                                                           |
| 7 But the LORD shall endure for ever; \* he hath also prepared his    |
| seat for judgment.\                                                   |
| 8 For he shall judge the world in righteousness, \* and minister true |
| judgment unto the people.\                                            |
| 9 The LORD also will be a defence for the oppressed, \* even a refuge |
| in due time of trouble.\                                              |
| 10 And they that know thy Name will put their trust in thee; \* for   |
| thou, LORD, hast never failed them that seek thee.\                   |
| 11 O praise the LORD which dwelleth in Sion; \* show the people of    |
| his doings.\                                                          |
| 12 For when he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them, \*  |
| and forgetteth not the complaint of the poor.\                        |
| 13 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider the trouble which I suffer of |
| them that hate me, \* thou that liftest me up from the gates of       |
| death;\                                                               |
| 14 That I may show all thy praises within the gates of the daughter   |
| of Sion: \* I will rejoice in thy salvation.\                         |
| 15 The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made; \* in the     |
| same net which they hid privily is their foot taken.\                 |
| 16 The LORD is known to execute judgment; \* the ungodly is trapped   |
| in the work of his own hands.\                                        |
| 17 The wicked shall be turned to destruction, \* and all the people   |
| that forget God.\                                                     |
| 18 For the poor shall not alway be forgotten; \* the patient abiding  |
| of the meek shall not perish for ever.\                               |
| 19 UP, LORD, and let not man have the upper hand; \* let the heathen  |
| be judged in thy sight.\                                              |
| 20 Put them in fear, O LORD, \* that the heathen may know themselves  |
| to be but men.                                                        |
