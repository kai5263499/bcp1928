| Isaiah 2:6-19**\                                                      |
| 6 Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because |
| they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the       |
| Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of            |
| strangers.\                                                           |
| 7 Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any    |
| end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is |
| there any end of their chariots:\                                     |
| 8 Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their    |
| own hands, that which their own fingers have made:\                   |
| 9 And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself:   |
| therefore forgive them not.\                                          |
| 10 Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the    |
| LORD, and for the glory of his majesty.\                              |
| 11 The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of    |
| men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that  |
| day.\                                                                 |
| 12 For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be upon every one that is   |
| proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and he shall   |
| be brought low:\                                                      |
| 13 And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up,   |
| and upon all the oaks of Bashan,\                                     |
| 14 And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are   |
| lifted up,\                                                           |
| 15 And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall,\            |
| 16 And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant          |
| pictures.\                                                            |
| 17 And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness  |
| of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that |
| day.\                                                                 |
| 18 And the idols he shall utterly abolish.\                           |
| 19 And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves  |
| of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, |
| when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.\                         |
| \                                                                     |
| **Second Lesson\                                                      |
| Matthew 25:14-29**\                                                   |
| 14 For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far        |
| country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his     |
| goods.\                                                               |
| 15 And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another  |
| one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway   |
| took his journey.\                                                    |
| 16 Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with    |
| the same, and made them other five talents.\                          |
| 17 And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.\  |
| 18 But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid |
| his lord\'s money.\                                                   |
| 19 After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth |
| with them.\                                                           |
| 20 And so he that had received five talents came and brought other    |
| five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents:    |
| behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.\                 |
| 21 His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: |
| thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler     |
| over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.\               |
| 22 He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou    |
| deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other      |
| talents beside them.\                                                 |
| 23 His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou |
| hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over     |
| many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.\                    |
| 24 Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I   |
| knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not      |
| sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:\                     |
| 25 And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo,    |
| there thou hast that is thine.\                                       |
| 26 His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful      |
| servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where |
| I have not strawed:\                                                  |
| 27 Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers,    |
| and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.\    |
| 28 Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which     |
| hath ten talents.\                                                    |
| 29 For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have     |
| abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that   |
| which he hath.\                                                       |

| First Lesson\                                                         |
| Genesis 19:1-3, 12-17, 24-28**\                                       |
| 1 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate |
| of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed      |
| himself with his face toward the ground;\                             |
| 2 And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your   |
| servant\'s house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye     |
| shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we  |
| will abide in the street all night.\                                  |
| 3 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and  |
| entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake        |
| unleavened bread, and they did eat.\                                  |
| 12 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son-in-law, |
| and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the      |
| city, bring them out of this place:\                                  |
| 13 For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen   |
| great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to       |
| destroy it.\                                                          |
| 14 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married    |
| his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD  |
| will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his     |
| sons in law.\                                                         |
| 15 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying,  |
| Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest     |
| thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.\                        |
| 16 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon   |
| the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the     |
| LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him |
| without the city.\                                                    |
| 17 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that |
| he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou |
| in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.\     |
| 24 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and    |
| fire from the LORD out of heaven;\                                    |
| 25 And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the      |
| inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.\      |
| 26 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar  |
| of salt.\                                                             |
| 27 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he      |
| stood before the LORD:\                                               |
| 28 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land   |
| of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up   |
| as the smoke of a furnace.\                                           |
| \                                                                     |
| **Second Lesson\                                                      |
| Luke 17:20-37**\                                                      |
| 20 And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God |
| should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not |
| with observation:\                                                    |
| 21 Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the    |
| kingdom of God is within you.\                                        |
| 22 And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall  |
| desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see |
| it.\                                                                  |
| 23 And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after   |
| them, nor follow them.\                                               |
| 24 For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part under    |
| heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the   |
| Son of man be in his day.\                                            |
| 25 But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this      |
| generation.\                                                          |
| 26 And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days  |
| of the Son of man.\                                                   |
| 27 They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in   |
| marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood  |
| came, and destroyed them all.\                                        |
| 28 Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they     |
| drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;\           |
| 29 But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and     |
| brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.\                       |
| 30 Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.\ |
| 31 In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in |
| the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in   |
| the field, let him likewise not return back.\                         |
| 32 Remember Lot\'s wife.\                                             |
| 33 Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever |
| shall lose his life shall preserve it.\                               |
| 34 I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the   |
| one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.\                     |
| 35 Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and  |
| the other left.\                                                      |
| 36 Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the     |
| other left.\                                                          |
| 37 And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto |
| them, Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered    |
| together.\                                                            |

| 1 How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is she |
| become as a widow! she that was great among the nations, and princess |
| among the provinces, how is she become tributary!\                    |
| 2 She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks:     |
| among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: all her friends    |
| have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.\      |
| 3 Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of  |
| great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: |
| all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.\                |
| 4 The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts:  |
| all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are         |
| afflicted, and she is in bitterness.\                                 |
| 5 Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the LORD    |
| hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her       |
| children are gone into captivity before the enemy.\                   |
| 6 And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her       |
| princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they are gone |
| without strength before the pursuer.\                                 |

| is good?\                                                             |
| 14 But and if ye suffer for righteousness\' sake, happy are ye: and   |
| be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;\                  |
| 15 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to   |
| give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that |
| is in you with meekness and fear:\                                    |
| 16 Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as |
| of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good       |
| conversation in Christ.\                                              |
| 17 For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for     |
| well doing, than for evil doing.\                                     |
| 18 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the      |
| unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the      |
| flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:\                                  |
| 19 By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;\    |
| 20 Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of    |
| God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a-preparing,        |
| wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.\               |
| 21 The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not  |
| the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good  |
| conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:\         |
| 22 Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels   |
| and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.\              |

| 1 Love righteousness, ye that be judges of the earth: think of the    |
| Lord with a good (heart,) and in simplicity of heart seek him.\       |
| 2 For he will be found of them that tempt him not; and sheweth        |
| himself unto such as do not distrust him.\                            |
| 3 For froward thoughts separate from God: and his power, when it is   |
| tried, reproveth the unwise.\                                         |
| 4 For into a malicious soul wisdom shall not enter; nor dwell in the  |
| body that is subject unto sin\                                        |
| 5 For the holy spirit of discipline will flee deceit, and remove from |
| thoughts that are without understanding, and will not abide when      |
| unrighteousness cometh in.\                                           |
| 6 For wisdom is a loving spirit; and will not acquit a blasphemer of  |
| his words: for God is witness of his reins, and a true beholder of    |
| his heart, and a hearer of his tongue.\                               |
| 7 For the Spirit of the Lord filleth the world: and that which        |
| containeth all things hath knowledge of the voice.\                   |
| \                                                                     |

| 12 And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, |
| and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;\                      |
| 13 And to esteem them very highly in love for their work\'s sake. And |
| be at peace among yourselves.\                                        |
| 14 Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort    |
| the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.\       |
| 15 See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow   |
| that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.\           |
| 16 Rejoice evermore.\                                                 |
| 17 Pray without ceasing.\                                             |
| 18 In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ  |
| Jesus concerning you.\                                                |
| 19 Quench not the Spirit.\                                            |
| 20 Despise not prophesyings.\                                         |
| 21 Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.\                   |
| 22 Abstain from all appearance of evil.\                              |
| 23 And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your |
| whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming |
| of our Lord Jesus Christ.\                                            |
| 24 Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.\             |

| Lamentations 1:15-22**\                                               |
| 15 The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of |
| me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the  |
| Lord hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, as in a          |
| winepress.\                                                           |
| 16 For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with      |
| water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from  |
| me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.\           |
| 17 Zion spreadeth forth her hands, and there is none to comfort her:  |
| the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob, that his adversaries should |
| be round about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.\   |
| 18 The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his             |
| commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my   |
| virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.\                    |
| 19 I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and mine  |
| elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought their meat to |
| relieve their souls.\                                                 |
| 20 Behold, O LORD; for I am in distress: my bowels are troubled; mine |
| heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad the |
| sword bereaveth, at home there is as death.\                          |
| 21 They have heard that I sigh: there is none to comfort me: all mine |
| enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done   |
| it: thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called, and they shall be  |
| like unto me.\                                                        |
| 22 Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as    |
| thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs are    |
| many, and my heart is faint.\                                         |
| \                                                                     |

| 1 Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm     |
| yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in  |
| the flesh hath ceased from sin;\                                      |
| 2 That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to  |
| the lusts of men, but to the will of God.\                            |
| 3 For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the    |
| will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess |
| of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:\         |
| 4 Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same |
| excess of riot, speaking evil of you:\                                |
| 5 Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and  |

| dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but    |
| live according to God in the spirit.\                                 |

| 3 For power is given you of the Lord, and sovereignty from the        |
| Highest, who shall try your works, and search out your counsels.\     |
| 4 Because, being ministers of his kingdom, ye have not judged a       |
| right, nor kept the law, nor walked after the counsel of God\         |
| 5 Horribly and speedily shall he come upon you: for a sharp judgment  |
| shall be to them that be in high places.\                             |
| 6 For mercy will soon pardon the meanest: but mighty men shall be     |
| mightily tormented.\                                                  |
| 7 For he which is Lord over all shall fear no man\'s person, neither  |
| shall he stand in awe of any man\'s greatness: for he hath made the   |
| small and great, and careth for all alike\                            |
| 8 But a sore trial shall come upon the mighty.\                       |
| 9 Unto you therefore, O kings, do I speak, that ye may learn wisdom,  |
| and not fall away.\                                                   |
| 10 For they that keep holiness holily shall be judged holy: and they  |
| that have learned such things shall find what to answer.\             |
| 11 Wherefore set your affection upon my words; desire them, and ye    |
| shall be instructed.\                                                 |

| and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger!\            |
| 2 The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath   |
| not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the  |
| daughter of Judah; he hath brought them down to the ground: he hath   |
| polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.\                        |
| 3 He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath |
| drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned        |
| against Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about.\      |
| 4 He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as |

| 5 The Lord was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath      |
| swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and |
| hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.\    |
| 6 And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a |
| garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the LORD hath   |
| caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and    |
| hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the        |
| priest.\                                                              |
| 7 The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary,   |
| he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; |
| they have made a noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a   |
| solemn feast.\                                                        |
| 8 The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: |
| he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from     |
| destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament;     |
| they languished together.\                                            |
| 9 Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken    |
| her bars: her king and her princes are among the Gentiles: the law is |
| no more; her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.\             |
| 10 The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, and keep   |
| silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded    |
| themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their   |
| heads to the ground.\                                                 |

| 12 Wisdom is glorious, and never fadeth away: yea, she is easily seen |
| of them that love her, and found of such as seek her.\                |
| I3 She preventeth them that desire her, in making herself first known |
| unto them.\                                                           |
| 14 Whoso seeketh her early shall have no great travail: for he shall  |
| find her sitting at his doors.\                                       |
| 15 To think therefore upon her is perfection of wisdom: and whoso     |
| watcheth for her shall quickly be without care.\                      |
| 16 For she goeth about seeking such as are worthy of her, sheweth     |
| herself favourably unto them in the ways, and meeteth them in every   |
| thought.\                                                             |
| 17 For the very true beginning of her is the desire of discipline;    |
| and the care of discipline is love;\                                  |
| 18 And love is the keeping of her laws; and the giving heed unto her  |
| laws is the assurance of incorruption;\                               |
| 19 And incorruption maketh us near unto God:\                         |

| 1 Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus       |
| Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,\                      |
| 2 That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by      |
| spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of     |
| Christ is at hand.\                                                   |
| 3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come,   |
| except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be        |
| revealed, the son of perdition;\                                      |
| 4 Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or  |
| that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God,   |
| showing himself that he is God.\                                      |
| 5 Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these    |
| things?\                                                              |

| 7 For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now      |
| letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.\                  |
| 8 And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume |
| with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness   |
| of his coming:\                                                       |
| 9 Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power |
| and signs and lying wonders,\                                         |
| 10 And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that        |
| perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they    |
| might be saved.\                                                      |
| 11 And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they  |
| should believe a lie:\                                                |
| 12 That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had  |
| pleasure in unrighteousness.\                                         |

| 1 How is the gold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed! the  |
| stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street.\   |
| 2 The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they    |
| esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!\   |
| 3 Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their  |
| young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the       |
| ostriches in the wilderness.\                                         |
| 4 The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth   |

| them.\                                                                |
| 5 They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they     |
| that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.\                   |
| 6 For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is  |
| greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown  |
| as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.\                          |

| 12 Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is  |
| to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:\          |
| 13 But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ\'s sufferings; |
| that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with      |
| exceeding joy.\                                                       |
| 14 If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the  |
| spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil |
| spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.\                         |
| 15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an  |
| evildoer, or as a busybody in other men\'s matters.\                  |
| 16 Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but  |
| let him glorify God on this behalf.\                                  |
| 17 For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: |
| and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey  |
| not the gospel of God?\                                               |

| and the sinner appear?\                                               |

| 10 I loved her above health and beauty, and chose to have her instead |
| of light: for the light that cometh from her never goeth out.\        |
| 11 All good things together came to me with her, and innumerable      |
| riches in her hands.\                                                 |

| 11 The LORD hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his fierce |
| anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured the      |
| foundations thereof.\                                                 |
| 12 The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world,      |
| would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have  |
| entered into the gates of Jerusalem.\                                 |
| 13 For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests,   |
| that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her,\            |
| 14 They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they have polluted |
| themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments.\   |
| 15 They cried unto them, Depart ye; It is unclean; depart, depart,    |
| touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the      |
| heathen, They shall no more sojourn there.\                           |
| 16 The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard    |
| them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured    |
| not the elders.\                                                      |
| 17 As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our        |
| watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us.\        |
| 18 They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is  |
| near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.\                   |
| 19 Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they    |
| pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the           |
| wilderness.\                                                          |

| 1 The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and  |
| a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the     |
| glory that shall be revealed:\                                        |
| 2 Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight      |
| thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but  |
| of a ready mind;\                                                     |
| 3 Neither as being lords over God\'s heritage, but being examples to  |
| the flock.\                                                           |
| 4 And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown  |
| of glory that fadeth not away.\                                       |
| 5 Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of |
| you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God  |
| resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.\                 |
| 6 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he   |
| may exalt you in due time:\                                           |

| 15 God hath granted me to speak as I would, and to conceive as is     |
| meet for the things that are given me: because it is he that leadeth  |
| unto wisdom, and directeth the wise.\                                 |
| 16 For in his hand are both we and our words; all wisdom also, and    |
| knowledge of workmanship.\                                            |
| 17 For he hath given me certain knowledge of the things that are,     |
| namely, to know how the world was made, and the operation of the      |
| elements:\                                                            |
| 18 The beginning, ending, and midst of the times: the alterations of  |
| the turning of the sun, and the change of seasons:\                   |
| 19 The circuits of years, and the positions of stars:\                |
| 20 The natures of living creatures, and the furies of wild beasts:    |
| the violence of winds, and the reasonings of men: the diversities of  |
| plants, and the virtues of roots:\                                    |
| 21 And all such things as are either secret or manifest, them I       |
| know.\                                                                |

| 6 Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, |
| that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh           |
| disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.\     |
| 7 For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not   |
| ourselves disorderly among you;\                                      |
| 8 Neither did we eat any man\'s bread for nought; but wrought with    |
| labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to  |
| any of you:\                                                          |
| 9 Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an example     |
| unto you to follow us.\                                               |
| 10 For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any |
| would not work, neither should he eat.\                               |
| 11 For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly,   |
| working not at all, but are busybodies.\                              |
| 12 Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus     |
| Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.\      |
| 13 But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.\                     |
| 14 And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man,   |
| and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.\                |
| 15 Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.\     |
| 16 Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means.  |
| The Lord be with you all.\                                            |

| 1 Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our    |
| reproach.\                                                            |
| 2 Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.\      |
| 3 We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers are as widows.\          |
| 4 We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us.\     |
| 5 Our necks are under persecution: we labour, and have no rest.\      |
| 6 We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians, to   |
| be satisfied with bread.\                                             |
| 7 Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their       |
| iniquities.\                                                          |
| 8 Servants have ruled over us: there is none that doth deliver us out |
| of their hand.\                                                       |
| 9 We gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword   |
| of the wilderness.\                                                   |
| 10 Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine.\   |
| 11 They ravished the women in Zion, and the maids in the cities of    |
| Judah.\                                                               |
| 12 Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not  |
| honoured.\                                                            |
| 13 They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the  |
| wood.\                                                                |
| 14 The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their     |
| music.\                                                               |
| 15 The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into           |

| sinned!\                                                              |
| 17 For this our heart is faint; for these things our eyes are dim.\   |

| upon it.\                                                             |

| roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:\             |
| 9 Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same            |
| afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.\ |

| 22 For wisdom, which is the worker of all things, taught me: for in   |
| her is an understanding spirit, holy, one only, manifold, subtil,     |
| lively, clear, undefiled, plain, not subject to hurt, loving the      |
| thing that is good, quick, which cannot be letted, ready to do good,\ |
| 23 Kind to man, stedfast, sure, free from care, having all power,     |
| overseeing all things, and going through all understanding, pure, and |
| most subtil, spirits.\                                                |
| 24 For wisdom is more moving than any motion: she passeth and goeth   |
| through all things by reason of her pureness.\                        |
| 25 For she is the breath of the power of God, and a pure influence    |
| flowing from the glory of the Almighty: therefore can no defiled      |
| thing fall into her.\                                                 |
| 26 For she is the brightness of the everlasting light, the unspotted  |
| mirror of the power of God, and the image of his goodness.\           |
| 27 And being but one, she can do all things: and remaining in         |
| herself, she maketh all things new: and in all ages entering into     |
| holy souls, she maketh them friends of God, and prophets.\            |
| 28 For God loveth none but him that dwelleth with wisdom.\            |
| 29 For she is more beautiful than the sun, and above all the order of |
| stars: being compared with the light, she is found before it.\        |

| wisdom.\                                                              |

| 1 Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them    |
| that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, |
| and called:\                                                          |
| 2 Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.\                |
| 3 Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common  |
| salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you    |
| that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once         |
| delivered unto the saints.\                                           |
| 4 For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old |
| ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our  |
| God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord  |
| Jesus Christ.\                                                        |
| 5 I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this,  |
| how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt,  |
| afterward destroyed them that believed not.\                          |
| 6 And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their    |
| own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness |
| unto the judgment of the great day.\                                  |
| 7 Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like       |
| manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after        |
| strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance  |
| of eternal fire.\                                                     |
| 8 Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise       |
| dominion, and speak evil of dignities.\                               |
| 9 Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he        |
| disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a       |
| railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.\                  |
| 10 But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what |
| they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt    |
| themselves.\                                                          |
| 11 Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran      |
| greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the    |
| gainsaying of Core.\                                                  |
| 12 These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with    |
| you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water,  |
| carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit,   |
| twice dead, plucked up by the roots;\                                 |
| 13 Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering    |
| stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.\       |
| 14 And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these,        |
| saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,\    |
| 15 To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly |
| among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly         |
| committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have  |
| spoken against him.\                                                  |
| 16 These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts;   |
| and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men\'s persons  |
| in admiration because of advantage.\                                  |
| 17 But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of    |
| the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;\                               |
| 18 How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time,   |
| who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.\                       |
| 19 These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the     |
| Spirit.\                                                              |
| 20 But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith,   |
| praying in the Holy Ghost,\                                           |
| 21 Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our   |
| Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.\                                 |
| 22 And of some have compassion, making a difference:\                 |
| 23 And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating    |
| even the garment spotted by the flesh.\                               |
| 24 Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present |
| you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,\   |
| 25 To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion   |
| and power, both now and ever. Amen.                                   |
|                                                                       |
