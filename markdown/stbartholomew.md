| O ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, who didst give to thine Apostle       |
| Bartholomew grace truly to believe and to preach thy Word; Grant, we  |
| beseech thee, unto thy Church, to love that Word which he believed,   |
| and both to preach and receive the same; through Jesus Christ our     |
| Lord. Amen.\                                                          |
|                                                                       |
| For the Epistle. Acts v. 12.                                          |
|                                                                       |
| BY the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought      |
| among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon\'s    |
| porch. And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the     |
| people magnified them. And believers were the more added to the Lord, |
| multitudes both of men and women.) Insomuch that they brought forth   |
| the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at |
| the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of     |
| them. There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto  |
| Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with        |
| unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.\                     |
|                                                                       |
| The Gospel. St. Luke xxii. 24.                                        |
|                                                                       |
| AND there was also a strife among them, which of them should be       |
| accounted the greatest. And he said unto them, The kings of the       |
| Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise          |
| authority upon them are called benefactors. But ye shall not be so:   |
| but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he  |
| that is chief, as he that doth serve. For whether is greater, he that |
| sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat?  |
| but I am among you as he that serveth. Ye are they which have         |
| continued with me in my temptations. And I appoint unto you a         |
| kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me; that ye may eat and     |
| drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the       |
| twelve tribes of Israel.                                              |
|                                                                       |
