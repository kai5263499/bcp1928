| **Psalm 65. Te decet hymnus.**\                                       |
| THOU, O God, art praised in Sion; \* and unto thee shall the vow be   |
| performed in Jerusalem.\                                              |
| 2 Thou that hearest the prayer, \* unto thee shall all flesh come.\   |
| 3 My misdeeds prevail against me: \* O be thou merciful unto our      |
| sins.\                                                                |
| 4 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and receivest unto thee: \*  |
| he shall dwell in thy court, and shall be satisfied with the          |
| pleasures of thy house, even of thy holy temple.\                     |
| 5 Thou shalt show us wonderful things in thy righteousness, O God of  |
| our salvation; \* thou that art the hope of all the ends of the       |
| earth, and of them that remain in the broad sea.\                     |
| 6 Who in his strength setteth fast the mountains, \* and is girded    |
| about with power.\                                                    |
| 7 Who stilleth the raging of the sea, \* and the noise of his waves,  |
| and the madness of the peoples.\                                      |
| 8 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts of the earth shall be   |
| afraid at thy tokens, \* thou that makest the out-goings of the       |
| morning and evening to praise thee.\                                  |
| 9 Thou visitest the earth, and blessest it; \* thou makest it very    |
| plenteous.\                                                           |
| 10 The river of God is full of water: \* thou preparest their corn,   |
| for so thou providest for the earth.\                                 |
| 11 Thou waterest her furrows; thou sendest rain into the little       |
| valleys thereof; \* thou makest it soft with the drops of rain, and   |
| blessest the increase of it.\                                         |
| 12 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; \* and thy clouds drop   |
| fatness.\                                                             |
| 13 They shall drop upon the dwellings of the wilderness; \* and the   |
| little hills shall rejoice on every side.\                            |
| 14 The folds shall be full of sheep; \* the valleys also shall stand  |
| so thick with corn, that they shall laugh and sing.                   |
