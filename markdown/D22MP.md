**Psalm 107. Confitemini Domino.**\
O GIVE thanks unto the LORD, for he is gracious, \* and his mercy
endureth for ever.\
2 Let them give thanks whom the LORD hath redeemed, \* and delivered
from the hand of the enemy;\
3 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west;
\* from the north, and from the south.\
4 They went astray in the wilderness out of the way, \* and found no
city to dwell in.\
5 Hungry and thirsty, \* their soul fainted in them.\
6 So they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, \* and he delivered them
from their distress.\
7 He led them forth by the right way, \* that they might go to the city
where they dwelt.\
8 O that men would therefore praise the LORD for his goodness; \* and
declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men!\
9 For he satisfieth the empty soul, \* and filleth the hungry soul with
goodness.\
10 Such as sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death, \* being fast
bound in misery and iron;\
11 Because they rebelled against the words of the Lord, \* and lightly
regarded the counsel of the Most Highest;\
12 He also brought down their heart through heaviness: \* they fell
down, and there was none to help them.\
13 SO when they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, \* he delivered
them out of their distress.\
14 For he brought them out of darkness, and out of the shadow of death,
\* and brake their bonds in sunder.\
15 O that men would therefore praise the LORD for his goodness; \* and
declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men !\
16 For he hath broken the gates of brass, \* and smitten the bars of
iron in sunder.\
17 Foolish men are plagued for their offence, \* and because of their
wickedness.\
18 Their soul abhorred all manner of meat, \* and they were even hard at
death\'s door.\
19 So when they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, \* he delivered
them out of their distress.\
20 He sent his word, and healed them; \* and they were saved from their
destruction.\
21 O that men would therefore praise the LORD for his goodness; \* and
declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men !\
22 That they would offer unto him the sacrifice of thanksgiving, \* and
tell out his works with gladness!\
23 They that go down to the sea in ships, \* and occupy their business
in great waters;\
24 These men see the works of the LORD, \* and his wonders in the deep.\
25 For at his word the stormy wind ariseth, \* which lifteth up the
waves thereof.\
26 They are carried up to the heaven, and down again to the deep; \*
their soul melteth away because of the trouble.\
27 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, \* and are at
their wit\'s end.\
28 SO when they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, \* he delivereth
them out of their distress.\
29 For he maketh the storm to cease, \* so that the waves thereof are
still.\
30 Then are they glad, because they are at rest; \* and so he bringeth
them unto the haven where they would be.\
31 O that men would therefore praise the LORD for his goodness; \* and
declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men!\
32 That they would exalt him also in the congregation of the people, \*
and praise him in the seat of the elders!\
33 He turneth the floods into a wilderness, \* and drieth up the
water-springs.\
34 A fruitful land maketh he barren, \* for the wickedness of them that
dwell therein.\
35 Again, he maketh the wilderness a standing water, \* and
water-springs of a dry ground.\
36 And there he setteth the hungry, \* that they may build them a city
to dwell in;\
37 That they may sow their land, and plant vineyards, \* to yield them
fruits of increase.\
38 He blesseth them, so that they multiply exceedingly; \* and suffereth
not their cattle to decrease.\
39 And again, when they are minished and brought low \* through
oppression, through any plague or trouble;\
40 Though he suffer them to be evil entreated through tyrants, \* and
let them wander out of the way in the wilderness;\
41 Yet helpeth he the poor out of misery, \* and maketh him households
like a flock of sheep.\
42 The righteous will consider this, and rejoice; \* and the mouth of
all wickedness shall be stopped.\
43 Whoso is wise, will ponder these things; \* and they shall understand
the loving-kindness of the LORD.
