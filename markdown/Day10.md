| **Psalm 50. Deus deorum.**\                                           |
| THE LORD, even the Most Mighty God, hath spoken, \* and called the    |
| world, from the rising up of the sun unto the going down thereof.\    |
| 2 Out of Sion hath God appeared \* in perfect beauty.\                |
| 3 Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence; \* there shall go   |
| before him a consuming fire, and a mighty tempest shall be stirred up |
| round about him.\                                                     |
| 4 He shall call the heaven from above, \* and the earth, that he may  |
| judge his people.\                                                    |
| 5 Gather my saints together unto me; \* those that have made a        |
| covenant with me with sacrifice.\                                     |
| 6 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness; \* for God is      |
| Judge himself.\                                                       |
| 7 Hear, O my people, and I will speak; \* I myself will testify       |
| against thee, O Israel; for I am God, even thy God.\                  |
| 8 I will not reprove thee because of thy sacrifices; \* as for thy    |
| burnt-offerings, they are alway before me.\                           |
| 9 I will take no bullock out of thine house, \* nor he-goats out of   |
| thy folds.\                                                           |
| 10 For all the beasts of the forest are mine, \* and so are the       |
| cattle upon a thousand hills.\                                        |
| 11 I know all the fowls upon the mountains, \* and the wild beasts of |
| the field are in my sight.\                                           |
| 12 If I be hungry, I will not tell thee; \* for the whole world is    |
| mine, and all that is therein.\                                       |
| 13 Thinkest thou that I will eat bulls\' flesh, \* and drink the      |
| blood of goats?\                                                      |
| 14 Offer unto God thanksgiving, \* and pay thy vows unto the Most     |
| Highest.\                                                             |
| 15 And call upon me in the time of trouble; \* so will I hear thee,   |
| and thou shalt praise me.\                                            |
| 16 But unto the ungodly saith God, \* Why dost thou preach my laws,   |
| and takest my covenant in thy mouth;\                                 |
| 17 Whereas thou hatest to be reformed, \* and hast cast my words      |
| behind thee?\                                                         |
| 18 When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst unto him; \* and hast   |
| been partaker with the adulterers.\                                   |
| 19 Thou hast let thy mouth speak wickedness, \* and with thy tongue   |
| thou hast set forth deceit.\                                          |
| 20 Thou sattest and spakest against thy brother; \* yea, and hast     |
| slandered thine own mother\'s son.\                                   |
| 21 These things hast thou done, and I held my tongue, and thou        |
| thoughtest wickedly, that I am even such a one as thyself; \* but I   |
| will reprove thee, and set before thee the things that thou hast      |
| done.\                                                                |
| 22 O consider this, ye that forget God, \* lest I pluck you away, and |
| there be none to deliver you.\                                        |
| 23 Whoso offereth me thanks and praise, he honoureth me; \* and to    |
| him that ordereth his way aright, will I show the salvation of God.\  |
| \                                                                     |
| **\                                                                   |
| Psalm 51. Miserere mei, Deus.**\                                      |
| HAVE mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness; \* according to  |
| the multitude of thy mercies do away mine offences.\                  |
| 2 Wash me throughly from my wickedness, \* and cleanse me from my     |
| sin.\                                                                 |
| 3 For I acknowledge my faults, \* and my sin is ever before me.\      |
| 4 Against thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight;   |
| \* that thou mightest be justified in thy saying, and clear when thou |
| shalt judge.\                                                         |
| 5 Behold, I was shapen in wickedness, \* and in sin hath my mother    |
| conceived me.\                                                        |
| 6 But lo, thou requirest truth in the inward parts, \* and shalt make |
| me to understand wisdom secretly.\                                    |
| 7 Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; \* thou      |
| shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.\                      |
| 8 Thou shalt make me hear of joy and gladness, \* that the bones      |
| which thou hast broken may rejoice.\                                  |
| 9 Turn thy face from my sins, \* and put out all my misdeeds.\        |
| 10 Make me a clean heart, O God, \* and renew a right spirit within   |
| me.\                                                                  |
| 11 Cast me not away from thy presence, \* and take not thy holy       |
| Spirit from me.\                                                      |
| 12 O give me the comfort of thy help again, \* and stablish me with   |
| thy free Spirit.\                                                     |
| 13 Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked, \* and sinners shall  |
| be converted unto thee.\                                              |
| 14 Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou that art the God of  |
| my health; \* and my tongue shall sing of thy righteousness.\         |
| 15 Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord, \* and my mouth shall show thy    |
| praise.\                                                              |
| 16 For thou desirest no sacrifice, else would I give it thee; \* but  |
| thou delightest not in burnt-offerings.\                              |
| 17 The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit: \* a broken and         |
| contrite heart, O God, shalt thou not despise.\                       |
| 18 O be favourable and gracious unto Sion; \* build thou the walls of |
| Jerusalem.\                                                           |
| 19 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness,    |
| with the burnt-offerings and oblations; \* then shall they offer      |
| young bullocks upon thine altar.\                                     |
| \                                                                     |
| **\                                                                   |
| Psalm 52. Quid gloriaris?**\                                          |
| WHY boastest thou thyself, thou tyrant, \* that thou canst do         |
| mischief;\                                                            |
| 2 Whereas the goodness of God \* endureth yet daily?\                 |
| 3 Thy tongue imagineth wickedness, \* and with lies thou cuttest like |
| a sharp razor.\                                                       |
| 4 Thou hast loved unrighteousness more than goodness, \* and          |
| falsehood more than righteousness.\                                   |
| 5 Thou hast loved to speak all words that may do hurt, \* O thou      |
| false tongue.\                                                        |
| 6 Therefore shall God destroy thee for ever; \* he shall take thee,   |
| and pluck thee out of thy dwelling, and root thee out of the land of  |
| the living.\                                                          |
| 7 The righteous also shall see this, and fear, \* and shall laugh him |
| to scorn:\                                                            |
| 8 Lo, this is the man that took not God for his strength; \* but      |
| trusted unto the multitude of his riches, and strengthened himself in |
| his wickedness.\                                                      |
| 9 As for me, I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God; \* my  |
| trust is in the tender mercy of God for ever and ever.\               |
| 10 I will alway give thanks unto thee for that thou hast done; \* and |
| I will hope in thy Name, for thy saints like it well.\                |
|                                                                       |

| **Psalm 53. Dixit insipiens.**\                                       |
| THE foolish body hath said in his heart, \* There is no God.\         |
| 2 Corrupt are they, and become abominable in their wickedness; \*     |
| there is none that doeth good.\                                       |
| 3 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, \* to see if  |
| there were any that would understand, and seek after God.\            |
| 4 But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become    |
| abominable; \* there is also none that doeth good, no not one.\       |
| 5 Are not they without understanding that work wickedness, \* eating  |
| up my people as if they would eat bread? they have not called upon    |
| God.\                                                                 |
| 6 They were afraid where no fear was; \* for God hath broken the      |
| bones of him that besieged thee; thou hast put them to confusion,     |
| because God hath despised them.\                                      |
| 7 O that the salvation were given unto Israel out of Sion! \* O that  |
| the Lord would deliver his people out of captivity!\                  |
| 8 Then should Jacob rejoice, \* and Israel should be right glad.\     |
| \                                                                     |
| **\                                                                   |
| Psalm 54. Deus, in Nomine.**\                                         |
| SAVE me, O God, for thy Name\'s sake, \* and avenge me in thy         |
| strength.\                                                            |
| 2 Hear my prayer, O God, \* and hearken unto the words of my mouth.\  |
| 3 For strangers are risen up against me; \* and tyrants, which have   |
| not God before their eyes, seek after my soul.\                       |
| 4 Behold, God is my helper; \* the Lord is with them that uphold my   |
| soul.\                                                                |
| 5 He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: \* destroy thou them in thy |
| truth.\                                                               |
| 6 An offering of a free heart will I give thee, and praise thy Name,  |
| O LORD; \* because it is so comfortable.\                             |
| 7 For he hath delivered me out of all my trouble; \* and mine eye     |
| hath seen his desire upon mine enemies.\                              |
| \                                                                     |
| **\                                                                   |
| Psalm 55. Exaudi, Deus.**\                                            |
| HEAR my prayer, O God, \* and hide not thyself from my petition.\     |
| 2 Take heed unto me, and hear me, \* how I mourn in my prayer, and am |
| vexed;\                                                               |
| 3 The enemy crieth so, and the ungodly cometh on so fast; \* for they |
| are minded to do me some mischief, so maliciously are they set        |
| against me.\                                                          |
| 4 My heart is disquieted within me, \* and the fear of death is       |
| fallen upon me.\                                                      |
| 5 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, \* and an horrible      |
| dread hath overwhelmed me.\                                           |
| 6 And I said, O that I had wings like a dove! \* for then would I     |
| flee away, and be at rest.\                                           |
| 7 Lo, then would I get me away far off, \* and remain in the          |
| wilderness.\                                                          |
| 8 I would make haste to escape, \* because of the stormy wind and     |
| tempest.\                                                             |
| 9 Destroy their tongues, O Lord, and divide them; \* for I have spied |
| unrighteousness and strife in the city.\                              |
| 10 Day and night they go about within the walls thereof: \* mischief  |
| also and sorrow are in the midst of it.\                              |
| 11 Wickedness is therein; \* deceit and guile go not out of her       |

| 12 For it is not an open enemy that hath done me this dishonour; \*   |
| for then I could have borne it;\                                      |
| 13 Neither was it mine adversary that did magnify himself against me; |
| \* for then peradventure I would have hid myself from him;\           |
| 14 But it was even thou, my companion, \* my guide, and mine own      |
| familiar friend.\                                                     |
| 15 We took sweet counsel together, \* and walked in the house of God  |
| as friends.\                                                          |
| 16 Let death come hastily upon them, and let them go down alive into  |
| the pit; \* for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.\    |
| 17 As for me, I will call upon God, \* and the LORD shall save me.\   |
| 18 In the evening, and morning, and at noon-day will I pray, and that |
| instantly; \* and he shall hear my voice.\                            |
| 19 It is he that hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that |
| was against me; \* for there were many that strove with me.\          |
| 20 Yea, even God, that endureth for ever, shall hear me, and bring    |
| them down; \* for they will not turn, nor fear God.\                  |
| 21 He laid his hands upon such as be at peace with him, \* and he     |
| brake his covenant.\                                                  |
| 22 The words of his mouth were softer than butter, having war in his  |
| heart; \* his words were smoother than oil, and yet be they very      |
| swords.\                                                              |
| 23 O cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall nourish thee, \* and |
| shall not suffer the righteous to fall for ever.\                     |
| 24 And as for them, \* thou, O God, shalt bring them into the pit of  |
| destruction.\                                                         |
| 25 The blood-thirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their  |
| days: \* nevertheless, my trust shall be in thee, O Lord.             |
|                                                                       |
