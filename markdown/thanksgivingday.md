| Who covereth the heaven with clouds, and prepareth rain for the       |

| for the use of men;\                                                  |

| Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; \* praise thy God, O Sion.\             |
| For he hath made fast the bars of thy gates, \* and hath blessed thy  |
| children within thee.\                                                |

| O MOST merciful Father, who hast blessed the labours of the           |

| The Epistle. St. James i. 16.                                         |
|                                                                       |
| DO not err, my beloved brethren. Every good gift and every perfect    |
| gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with   |
| whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. Of his own will   |
| begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of       |
| firstfruits of his creatures. Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let     |
| every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath: for the     |
| wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God. Wherefore lay      |
| apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with |
| meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls. But be |
| ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own        |
| selves. For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is     |
| like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass: for he         |
| beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what |
| manner of man he was. But whoso looketh into the perfect law of       |
| liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but |
| a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed. If any man |
| among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but      |
| deceiveth his own heart, this man\'s religion is vain. Pure religion  |
| and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the         |
| fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself        |
| unspotted from the world.\                                            |
|                                                                       |
| The Gospel. St. Matthew vi. 25.                                       |
|                                                                       |
| JESUS said, Be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat, or what  |
| ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not   |
| the life more than food, and the body than raiment? Behold the fowls  |
| of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into   |
| barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better  |
| than they? Which of you by being anxious can add one cubit unto the   |
| measure of his life? And why are ye anxious for raiment? Consider the |
| lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they    |
| spin: and yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was  |
| not arrayed like one of these. Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass  |
| of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven,   |
| shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith? Therefore be |
| not anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or,  |
| Wherewithal shall we be clothed? (For after all these things do the   |
| Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of |
| all these things. But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his       |
| righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. Be not   |
| therefore anxious for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought   |
| for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil         |
| thereof.                                                              |
