| \                                                                     |
|                                                                       |
| **Psalms 10. Ut quid, Domine ?**\                                     |
| WHY standest thou so far off, O LORD, \* and hidest thy face in the   |
| needful time of trouble?\                                             |
| 2 The ungodly, for his own lust, doth persecute the poor: \* let them |
| be taken in the crafty wiliness that they have imagined.\             |
| 3 For the ungodly hath made boast of his own heart\'s desire, \* and  |
| speaketh good of the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.\              |
| 4 The ungodly is so proud, that he careth not for God, \* neither is  |
| God in all his thoughts.\                                             |
| 5 His ways are alway grievous; \* thy judgments are far above out of  |
| his sight, and therefore defieth he all his enemies.\                 |
| 6 For he hath said in his heart, Tush, I shall never be cast down, \* |
| there shall no harm happen unto me.\                                  |
| 7 His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and fraud; \* under his       |
| tongue is ungodliness and vanity.\                                    |
| 8 He sitteth lurking in the thievish corners of the streets, \* and   |
| privily in his lurking dens doth he murder the innocent; his eyes are |
| set against the poor.\                                                |
| 9 For he lieth waiting secretly; even as a lion lurketh he in his     |
| den, \* that he may ravish the poor.\                                 |
| 10 He doth ravish the poor, \* when he getteth him into his net.\     |
| 11 He falleth down, and humbleth himself, \* that the congregation of |
| the poor may fall into the hands of his captains.\                    |
| 12 He hath said in his heart, Tush, God hath forgotten; \* he hideth  |
| away his face, and he will never see it.\                             |
| 13 Arise, O LORD God, and lift up thine hand; \* forget not the       |
| poor.\                                                                |
| 14 Wherefore should the wicked blaspheme God, \* while he doth say in |
| his heart, Tush, thou God carest not for it?\                         |
| 15 Surely thou hast seen it; \* for thou beholdest ungodliness and    |
| wrong, that thou mayest take the matter into thy hand.\               |
| 16 The poor committeth himself unto thee; \* for thou art the helper  |
| of the friendless.\                                                   |
| 17 Break thou the power of the ungodly and malicious; \* search out   |
| his ungodliness, until thou find none.\                               |
| 18 The LORD is King for ever and ever, \* and the heathen are         |
| perished out of the land.\                                            |
| 19 LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the poor; \* thou preparest    |
| their heart, and thine ear hearkeneth;\                               |
| 20 To help the fatherless and poor unto their right, \* that the man  |
| of the earth be no more exalted against them.                         |
