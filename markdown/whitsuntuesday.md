| GRANT, we beseech thee, merciful God, that thy Church, being gathered |
| together in unity by thy Holy Spirit, may manifest thy power among    |
| all peoples, to the glory of thy Name; through Jesus Christ our Lord, |
| who liveth and reigneth with thee and the same Spirit, one God, world |
| without end. Amen.\                                                   |

| For the Epistle. Acts viii. 14.                                       |
|                                                                       |
| WHEN the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had      |
| received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: who,    |
| when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive    |
| the Holy Ghost: for as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they |
| were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Then laid they their     |
| hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.\                     |
|                                                                       |
| The Gospel. St. John x. 1.                                            |
|                                                                       |
| VERILY, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into |
| the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief    |
| and a robber. But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of  |
| the sheep. To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice;   |
| and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. And when  |
| he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep   |
| follow him: for they know his voice. And a stranger will they not     |
| follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of        |
| strangers. This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood    |
| not what things they were which he spake unto them. Then said Jesus   |
| unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the |
| sheep. All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the  |
| sheep did not hear them. I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he |
| shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. The thief  |
| cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come  |
| that they might have life, and that they might have it more           |
| abundantly.                                                           |
