| ALMIGHTY God, Lord of heaven and earth; We beseech thee to pour forth |
| thy blessing upon this land, and to give us a fruitful season; that   |
| we, constantly receiving thy bounty, may evermore give thanks unto    |
| thee in thy holy Church; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\        |
|                                                                       |
| For the Epistle. Ezekiel xxxiv. 25.                                   |
|                                                                       |
| I WILL make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil    |
| beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell safely in the   |
| wilderness, and sleep in the woods. And I will make them and the      |
| places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to |
| come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing. And the  |
| tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield    |
| her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know    |
| that I am the LORD, when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and   |
| delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of     |
| them. And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall  |
| the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and   |
| none shall make them afraid. And I will raise up for them a plant of  |
| renown, and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land,   |
| neither bear the shame of the heathen any more. Thus shall they know  |
| that I the LORD their God am with them, and that they, even the house |
| of Israel, are my people, saith the Lord GOD. And ye my flock, the    |
| flock of my pasture, are men, and I am your God, saith the Lord GOD.\ |

| The Gospel. St. Luke xi. 5.                                           |
|                                                                       |
| JESUS said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go  |
| unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves; |
| for a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing |
| to set before him? and he from within shall answer and say, Trouble   |
| me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I   |
| cannot rise and give thee. I say unto you, Though he will not rise    |
| and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his            |
| importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth. And I    |
| say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall      |
| find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that      |
| asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that        |
| knocketh it shall be opened. If a son shall ask bread of any of you   |
| that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will |
| he for a fish give him a serpent? or if he shall ask an egg, will he  |
| offer him a scorpion? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good   |
| gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father    |
| give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?                            |
|                                                                       |
