| 16 Give glory to the LORD your God, before he cause darkness, and     |
| before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye look  |
| for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross     |
| darkness.\                                                            |
| 17 But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places    |
| for your pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with       |
| tears, because the LORD\'S flock is carried away captive.\            |
| 18 Say unto the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down:   |
| for your principalities shall come down, even the crown of your       |
| glory.\                                                               |

| them: Judah shall be carried away captive all of it, it shall be      |
| wholly carried away captive.\                                         |

| 35 And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying,    |
| Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall    |

| indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I  |
| am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:\                             |
| 40 But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to     |
| give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.\         |
| 41 And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with   |
| James and John.\                                                      |
| 42 But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that    |
| they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship  |
| over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.\        |
| 43 But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great      |
| among you, shall be your minister:\                                   |

| 2 If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give    |
| glory unto my name, saith the LORD of hosts, I will even send a curse |
| upon you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I have cursed them    |
| already, because ye do not lay it to heart.\                          |

| it.\                                                                  |
| 4 And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that  |
| my covenant might be with Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.\             |
| 5 My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him  |
| for the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name.\  |
| 6 The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in    |
| his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many    |
| away from iniquity.\                                                  |
| 7 For the priest\'s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek  |
| the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.\  |
| 8 But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble  |
| at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the LORD of |

| in the law.\                                                          |

| the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.\      |
| 13 And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old      |
| men\'s counsel that they gave him;\                                   |
| 14 And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My   |

| also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with           |
| scorpions.\                                                           |

| was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD   |
| spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.\        |
| 16 So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the  |

| Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.\                                   |
| 18 Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all  |
| Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam  |
| made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.\       |
| 19 So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.\      |
| 20 And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come  |
