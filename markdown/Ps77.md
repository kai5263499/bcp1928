|                                                                       |
| **Psalm 77. Voce mea ad Dominum.**\                                   |
| I WILL cry unto God with my voice; \* even unto God will I cry with   |
| my voice, and he shall hearken unto me.\                              |
| 2 In the time of my trouble I sought the Lord: \* I stretched forth   |
| my hands unto him, and ceased not in the night season; my soul        |
| refused comfort.\                                                     |
| 3 When I am in heaviness, I will think upon God; \* when my heart is  |
| vexed, I will complain.\                                              |
| 4 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: \* I am so feeble that I cannot      |
| speak.\                                                               |
| 5 I have considered the days of old, \* and the years that are past.\ |
| 6 I call to remembrance my song, \* and in the night I commune with   |
| mine own heart, and search out my spirit.\                            |
| 7 Will the Lord absent himself for ever? \* and will he be no more    |
| intreated?\                                                           |
| 8 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? \* and is his promise come        |
| utterly to an end for evermore?\                                      |
| 9 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? \* and will he shut up his       |
| loving-kindness in displeasure?\                                      |
| 10 And I said, It is mine own infirmity; \* but I will remember the   |
| years of the right hand of the Most Highest.\                         |
| 11 I will remember the works of the LORD, \* and call to mind thy     |
| wonders of old time.\                                                 |
| 12 I will think also of all thy works, \* and my talking shall be of  |
| thy doings.\                                                          |
| 13 Thy way, O God, is holy: \* who is so great a God as our God?\     |
| 14 Thou art the God that doest wonders, \* and hast declared thy      |
| power among the peoples.\                                             |
| 15 Thou hast mightily delivered thy people, \* even the sons of Jacob |
| and Joseph.\                                                          |
| 16 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee, and were afraid;  |
| \* the depths also were troubled.\                                    |
| 17 The clouds poured out water, the air thundered, \* and thine       |
| arrows went abroad.\                                                  |
| 18 The voice of thy thunder was heard round about: \* the lightnings  |
| shone upon the ground; the earth was moved, and shook withal.\        |
| 19 Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in the great waters, \* and   |
| thy footsteps are not known.\                                         |
| 20 Thou leddest thy people like sheep, \* by the hand of Moses and    |
| Aaron.                                                                |
