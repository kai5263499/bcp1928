**Psalm 110. Dixit Dominus.**\
THE LORD said unto my Lord, \* Sit thou on my right hand, until I make
thine enemies thy footstool.\
2 The LORD shall send the rod of thy power out of Sion: \* be thou
ruler, even in the midst among thine enemies.\
3 In the day of thy power shall thy people offer themselves willingly
with an holy worship: \* thy young men come to thee as dew from the womb
of the morning.\
4 The LORD sware, and will not repent, \* Thou art a Priest for ever
after the order of Melchizedek.\
5 The Lord upon thy right hand \* shall wound even kings in the day of
his wrath.\
6 He shall judge among the heathen; \* he shall fill the places with the
dead bodies, and smite in sunder the heads over divers countries.\
7 He shall drink of the brook in the way; \* therefore shall he lift up
his head.\

**Psalm 111. Confitebor tibi.**\
I WILL give thanks unto the LORD with my whole heart, \* secretly among
the faithful, and in the congregation.\
2 The works of the LORD are great, \* sought out of all them that have
pleasure therein.\
3 His work is worthy to be praised and had in honour, \* and his
righteousness endureth for ever.\
4 The merciful and gracious LORD hath so done his marvellous works, \*
that they ought to be had in remembrance.\
5 He hath given meat unto them that fear him; \* he shall ever be
mindful of his covenant.\
6 He hath showed his people the power of his works, \* that he may give
them the heritage of the heathen.\
7 The works of his hands are verity and judgment; \* all his
commandments are true.\
8 They stand fast for ever and ever, \* and are done in truth and
equity.\
9 He sent redemption unto his people; \* he hath commanded his covenant
for ever; holy and reverend is his Name.\
10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; \* a good
understanding have all they that do thereafter; his praise endureth for
ever.\

**Psalm 112. Beatus vir.**\
BLESSED is the man that feareth the LORD; \* he hath great delight in
his commandments.\
2 His seed shall be mighty upon earth; \* the generation of the faithful
shall be blessed.\
3 Riches and plenteousness shall be in his house; \* and his
righteousness endureth for ever.\
4 Unto the godly there ariseth up light in the darkness; \* he is
merciful, loving, and righteous.\
5 A good man is merciful, and lendeth; \* and will guide his words with
discretion.\
6 For he shall never be moved: \* and the righteous shall be had in
everlasting remembrance.\
7 He will not be afraid of any evil tidings; \* for his heart standeth
fast, and believeth in the LORD.\
8 His heart is stablished, and will not shrink, \* until he see his
desire upon his enemies.\
9 He hath dispersed abroad, and given to the poor. \* and his
righteousness remaineth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with
honour.\
10 The ungodly shall see it, and it shall grieve him; \* he shall gnash
with his teeth, and consume away; the desire of the ungodly shall
perish.\

**Psalm 113. Laudate, pueri.**\
PRAISE the LORD, ye servants; \* O praise the Name of the LORD.\
2 Blessed be the Name of the LORD \* from this time forth for evermore.\
3 The LORD\'S Name is praised \* from the rising up of the sun unto the
going down of the same.\
4 The LORD is high above all nations, \* and his glory above the
heavens.\
5 Who is like unto the LORD our God, that hath his dwelling so high, \*
and yet humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven and
earth!\
6 He taketh up the simple out of the dust, \* and lifteth the poor out
of the mire;\
7 That he may set him with the princes, \* even with the princes of his
people.\
8 He maketh the barren woman to keep house, \* and to be a joyful mother
of children.
