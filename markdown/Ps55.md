| \                                                                     |

| **Psalm 55. Exaudi, Deus.**\                                          |
| HEAR my prayer, O God, \* and hide not thyself from my petition.\     |
| 2 Take heed unto me, and hear me, \* how I mourn in my prayer, and am |
| vexed;\                                                               |
| 3 The enemy crieth so, and the ungodly cometh on so fast; \* for they |
| are minded to do me some mischief, so maliciously are they set        |
| against me.\                                                          |
| 4 My heart is disquieted within me, \* and the fear of death is       |
| fallen upon me.\                                                      |
| 5 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, \* and an horrible      |
| dread hath overwhelmed me.\                                           |
| 6 And I said, O that I had wings like a dove! \* for then would I     |
| flee away, and be at rest.\                                           |
| 7 Lo, then would I get me away far off, \* and remain in the          |
| wilderness.\                                                          |
| 8 I would make haste to escape, \* because of the stormy wind and     |
| tempest.\                                                             |
| 9 Destroy their tongues, O Lord, and divide them; \* for I have spied |
| unrighteousness and strife in the city.\                              |
| 10 Day and night they go about within the walls thereof: \* mischief  |
| also and sorrow are in the midst of it.\                              |
| 11 Wickedness is therein; \* deceit and guile go not out of her       |
| streets.\                                                             |
| 12 For it is not an open enemy that hath done me this dishonour; \*   |
| for then I could have borne it;\                                      |
| 13 Neither was it mine adversary that did magnify himself against me; |
| \* for then peradventure I would have hid myself from him;\           |
| 14 But it was even thou, my companion, \* my guide, and mine own      |
| familiar friend.\                                                     |
| 15 We took sweet counsel together, \* and walked in the house of God  |
| as friends.\                                                          |
| 16 Let death come hastily upon them, and let them go down alive into  |
| the pit; \* for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.\    |
| 17 As for me, I will call upon God, \* and the LORD shall save me.\   |
| 18 In the evening, and morning, and at noon-day will I pray, and that |
| instantly; \* and he shall hear my voice.\                            |
| 19 It is he that hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that |
| was against me; \* for there were many that strove with me.\          |
| 20 Yea, even God, that endureth for ever, shall hear me, and bring    |
| them down; \* for they will not turn, nor fear God.\                  |
| 21 He laid his hands upon such as be at peace with him, \* and he     |
| brake his covenant.\                                                  |
| 22 The words of his mouth were softer than butter, having war in his  |
| heart; \* his words were smoother than oil, and yet be they very      |
| swords.\                                                              |
| 23 O cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall nourish thee, \* and |
| shall not suffer the righteous to fall for ever.\                     |
| 24 And as for them, \* thou, O God, shalt bring them into the pit of  |
| destruction.\                                                         |
| 25 The blood-thirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their  |
| days: \* nevertheless, my trust shall be in thee, O Lord.             |
