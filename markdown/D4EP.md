**Psalm 22. Deus, Deus meus.**\
MY God, my God, look upon me; why hast thou forsaken me? \* and art so
far from my health, and from the words of my complaint?\
2 O my God, I cry in the day-time, but thou hearest not; \* and in the
night season also I take no rest.\
3 And thou continuest holy, \* O thou Worship of Israel.\
4 Our fathers hoped in thee; \* they trusted in thee, and thou didst
deliver them.\
5 They called upon thee, and were holpen; \* they put their trust in
thee, and were not confounded.\
6 But as for me, I am a worm, and no man; \* a very scorn of men, and
the outcast of the people.\
7 All they that see me laugh me to scorn; \* they shoot out their lips,
and shake their heads, saying,\
8 He trusted in the LORD, that he would deliver him; \* let him deliver
him, if he will have him.\
9 But thou art he that took me out of my mother\'s womb; \* thou wast my
hope, when I hanged yet upon my mother\'s breasts.\
10 I have been left unto thee ever since I was born; \* thou art my God
even from my mother\'s womb.\
11 O go not from me; for trouble is hard at hand, \* and there is none
to help me.\
12 Many oxen are come about me; \* fat bulls of Bashan close me in on
every side.\
13 They gape upon me with their mouths, \* as it were a ramping and a
roaring lion.\
14 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint; \* my
heart also in the midst of my body is even like melting wax.\
15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my\
tongue cleaveth to my gums, \* and thou bringest me into the dust of
death.\
16 For many dogs are come about me, \* and the council of the wicked
layeth siege against me.\
17 They pierced my hands and my feet: I may tell all my bones: \* they
stand staring and looking upon me.\
18 They part my garments among them, \* and cast lots upon my vesture.\
19 But be not thou far from me, O LORD; \* thou art my succour, haste
thee to help me.\
20 Deliver my soul from the sword, \* my darling from the power of the
dog.\
21 Save me from the lion\'s mouth; \* thou hast heard me also from among
the horns of the unicorns.\
22 I will declare thy Name unto my brethren; \* in the midst of the
congregation will I praise thee.\
23 O praise the LORD, ye that fear him: \* magnify him, all ye of the
seed of Jacob; and fear him, all ye seed of Israel.\
24 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the low estate of the poor; \*
he hath not hid his face from him; but when he called unto him he heard
him.\
25 My praise is of thee in the great-congregation; \* my vows will I
perform in the sight of them that fear him.\
26 The poor shall eat, and be satisfied; they that seek after the LORD
shall praise him: \* your heart shall live for ever.\
27 All the ends of the world shall remember themselves, and be turned
unto the LORD; \* and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship
before him.\
28 For the kingdom is the LORD\'S, \* and he is the Governor among the
nations.\
29 All such as be fat upon earth \* have eaten, and worshipped.\
30 All they that go down into the dust shall kneel before him; \* and no
man hath quickened his own soul.\
31 My seed shall serve him: \* they shall be counted unto the Lord for a
generation.\
32 They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness \* unto a people
that shall be born, whom the Lord hath made.\

**Psalm 23. Dominus regit me.**\
THE LORD is my shepherd; \* therefore can I lack nothing.\
2 He shall feed me in a green pasture, \* and lead me forth beside the
waters of comfort.\
3 He shall convert my soul, \* and bring me forth in the paths of
righteousness for his Name\'s sake.\
4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will
fear no evil; \* for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff comfort
me.\
5 Thou shalt prepare a table before me in the presence of them that
trouble me; \* thou hast anointed my head with oil, and my cup shall be
full.\
6 Surely thy loving-kindness and mercy shall follow me all the days of
my life; \* and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
