| grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field:\ |
| []{#anchor225778}7 The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because    |

| 1 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius  |
| Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, |
| and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of       |
| Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,\                   |
| 2 Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came     |
| unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.\                    |
| 3 And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the        |
| baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;\                     |
| 4 As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet,    |
| saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way |
| of the Lord, make his paths straight.\                                |
| 5 Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be  |
| brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough    |
| ways shall be made smooth;\                                           |
| 6 And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.\                      |
| 7 Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of     |
| him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the     |
| wrath to come?\                                                       |
| 8 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to |
| say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto  |
| you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto       |
| Abraham.\                                                             |
| 9 And now also the ax is laid unto the root of the trees: every tree  |
| therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast  |
| into the fire.\                                                       |
| 10 And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?\          |
| 11 He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let him  |
| impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do       |
| likewise.\                                                            |
| 12 Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him,        |
| Master, what shall we do?\                                            |
| 13 And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed  |
| you.\                                                                 |
| 14 And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall  |
| we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse   |
| any falsely; and be content with your wages.\                         |
| 15 And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their  |
| hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not;\                  |
| 16 John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with     |
| water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I   |
| am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost    |
| and with fire:\                                                       |

| 5 There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain       |
| priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of    |
| the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.\                  |
| 6 And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the         |
| commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.\                   |
| 7 And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they  |
| both were now well stricken in years.\                                |
| 8 And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest\'s office    |
| before God in the order of his course,\                               |
| 9 According to the custom of the priest\'s office, his lot was to     |
| burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.\               |
| 10 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the  |
| time of incense.\                                                     |
| 11 And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the   |
| right side of the altar of incense.\                                  |
| 12 And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon    |
| him.\                                                                 |
| 13 But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer   |
| is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou      |
| shalt call his name John.\                                            |
| 14 And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at    |
| his birth.\                                                           |
| 15 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink    |
| neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy   |
| Ghost, even from his mother\'s womb.\                                 |
| 16 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their |
| God.\                                                                 |
| 17 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to    |
| turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient   |
| to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the    |

| 18 And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for  |
| I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.\                 |
| 19 And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in |
| the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to show thee |
| these glad tidings.\                                                  |

| so long in the temple.\                                               |
| 22 And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they       |
| perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned    |
| unto them, and remained speechless.\                                  |

| 16 And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the   |
| breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand      |
| furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.\ |
| 17 And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four    |
| cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.\    |

| pure gold, like unto clear glass.\                                    |
| 19 And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with    |
| all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the   |
| second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;\   |
| 20 The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolyte;  |
| the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the |
| eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.\                       |

| in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light |
| thereof.\                                                             |

| with child of the Holy Ghost.\                                        |

| her a public example, was minded to put her away privily.\            |
| 20 But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the     |
| Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, |
| fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived |
| in her is of the Holy Ghost.\                                         |
| []{#anchor460603}21 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt   |
| call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.\   |
| 22 Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken |
| of the Lord by the prophet, saying,\                                  |
