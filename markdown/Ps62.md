| **Psalm 62. Nonne Deo?**\                                             |
| MY soul truly waiteth still upon God; \* for of him cometh my         |
| salvation.\                                                           |
| 2 He verily is my strength and my salvation; \* he is my defence, so  |
| that I shall not greatly fall.\                                       |
| 3 How long will ye imagine mischief against every man? \* Ye shall be |
| slain all the sort of you; yea, as a tottering wall shall ye be, and  |
| like a broken hedge.\                                                 |
| 4 Their device is only how to put him out whom God will exalt; \*     |
| their delight is in lies; they give good words with their mouth, but  |
| curse with their heart.\                                              |
| 5 Nevertheless, my soul, wait thou still upon God; \* for my hope is  |
| in him.\                                                              |
| 6 He truly is my strength and my salvation; \* he is my defence, so   |
| that I shall not fall.\                                               |
| 7 In God is my health and my glory; \* the rock of my might; and in   |
| God is my trust.\                                                     |
| 8 O put your trust in him alway, ye people; \* pour out your hearts   |
| before him, for God is our hope.\                                     |
| 9 As for the children of men, they are but vanity; the children of    |
| men are deceitful; \* upon the weights they are altogether lighter    |
| than vanity itself.\                                                  |
| 10 O trust not in wrong and robbery; give not yourselves unto vanity: |
| \* if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.\                 |
| 11 God spake once, and twice I have also heard the same, \* that      |
| power belongeth unto God;\                                            |
| 12 And that thou, Lord, art merciful; \* for thou rewardest every man |
| according to his work.                                                |
