| **Psalms 40. Expectans expectavi.**\                                  |
| I WAITED patiently for the LORD, \* and he inclined unto me, and      |
| heard my calling.\                                                    |
| 2 He brought me also out of the horrible pit, out of the mire and     |
| clay, \* and set my feet upon the rock, and ordered my goings.\       |
| 3 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, \* even a thanksgiving unto |
| our God.\                                                             |
| 4 Many shall see it, and fear, \* and shall put their trust in the    |
| LORD.\                                                                |
| 5 Blessed is the man that hath set his hope in the LORD, \* and       |
| turned not unto the proud, and to such as go about with lies.\        |
| 6 O LORD my God, great are the wondrous works which thou hast done,   |
| like as be also thy thoughts, which are to us-ward; \* and yet there  |
| is no man that ordereth them unto thee.\                              |
| 7 If I should declare them, and speak of them, \* they should be more |
| than I am able to express.\                                           |
| 8 Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, \* but mine ears hast     |
| thou opened.\                                                         |
| 9 Burnt-offering and sacrifice for sin hast thou not required: \*     |
| then said I, Lo, I come;\                                             |
| 10 In the volume of the book it is written of me, that I should       |
| fulfil thy will, O my God: \* I am content to do it; yea, thy law is  |
| within my heart.\                                                     |
| 11 I have declared thy righteousness in the great congregation: \*    |
| lo, I will not refrain my lips, O LORD, and that thou knowest.\       |
| 12 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; \* my talk hath  |
| been of thy truth, and of thy salvation.\                             |
| 13 I have not kept back thy loving mercy and truth \* from the great  |
| congregation.\                                                        |
| 14 Withdraw not thou thy mercy from me, O LORD; \* let thy            |
| loving-kindness and thy truth alway preserve me.\                     |
| 15 For innumerable troubles are come about me; my sins have taken     |
| such hold upon me, that I am not able to look up; \* yea, they are    |
| more in number than the hairs of my head, and my heart hath failed    |
| me.\                                                                  |
| 16 O LORD, let it be thy pleasure to deliver me; \* make haste, O     |
| LORD, to help me.\                                                    |
| 17 Let them be ashamed, and confounded together, that seek after my   |
| soul to destroy it; \* let them be driven backward, and put to        |
| rebuke, that wish me evil.\                                           |
| 18 Let them be desolate, and rewarded with shame, \* that say unto    |
| me, Fie upon thee! fie upon thee!\                                    |
| 19 Let all those that seek thee, be joyful and glad in thee; \* and   |
| let such as love thy salvation, say alway, The LORD be praised.\      |
| 20 As for me, I am poor and needy; \* but the Lord careth for me.\    |
| 21 Thou art my helper and redeemer; \* make no long tarrying, O my    |
| God.                                                                  |
