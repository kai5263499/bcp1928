**Psalm 82. Deus stetit.**\
GOD standeth in the congregation of princes; \* he is a Judge among
gods.\
2 How long will ye give wrong judgment, \* and accept the persons of the
ungodly?\
3 Defend the poor and fatherless; \* see that such as are in need and
necessity have right.\
4 Deliver the outcast and poor; \* save them from the hand of the
ungodly.\
5 They know not, neither do they understand, but walk on still in
darkness: \* all the foundations of the earth are out of course.\
6 I have said, Ye are gods, \* and ye are all the children of the Most
Highest.\
7 But ye shall die like men, \* and fall like one of the princes.\
8 Arise, O God, and judge thou the earth; \* for thou shalt take all
nations to thine inheritance.\

**Psalm 83. Deus, quis similis?**\
HOLD not thy tongue, O God, keep not still silence: \* refrain not
thyself, O God.\
2 For lo, thine enemies make a murmuring; \* and they that hate thee
have lift up their head.\
3 They have imagined craftily against thy people, \* and taken counsel
against thy secret ones.\
4 They have said, Come, and let us root them out, that they be no more a
people, \* and that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.\
5 For they have cast their heads together with one consent, \* and are
confederate against thee:\
6 The tabernacles of the Edomites, and the Ishmaelites; \* the Moabites,
and Hagarenes;\
7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; \* the Philistines, with them that dwell
at Tyre.\
8 Assyria also is joined with them; \* they have holpen the children of
Lot.\
9 But do thou to them as unto the Midianites; \* unto Sisera, and unto
Jabin at the brook of Kishon;\
10 Who perished at Endor, \* and became as the dung of the earth.\
11 Make them and their princes like Oreb and Zeeb; \* yea, make all
their princes like as Zebah and Zalmunna;\
12 Who say, Let us take to ourselves \* the houses of God in
possession.\
13 O my God, make them like unto the whirling dust, \* and as the
stubble before the wind;\
14 Like as the fire that burneth up the forest, \* and as the flame that
consumeth the mountains;\
15 Pursue them even so with thy tempest, \* and make them afraid with
thy storm.\
16 Make their faces ashamed, O LORD, \* that they may seek thy Name.\
17 Let them be confounded and vexed ever more and more; \* let them be
put to shame, and perish.\
18 And they shall know that thou, whose Name is JEHOVAH, \* art only the
Most Highest over all the earth.\

**Psalm 84. Quam dilecta!**\
O HOW amiable are thy dwellings, \* thou LORD of hosts!\
2 My soul hath a desire and longing to enter into the courts of the
LORD; \* my heart and my flesh rejoice in the living God.\
3 Yea, the sparrow hath found her an house, and the swallow a nest,
where she may lay her young; \* even thy altars, O LORD of hosts, my
King and my God.\
4 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house; \* they will be alway
praising thee.\
5 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; \* in whose heart are
thy ways.\
6 Who going through the vale of misery use it for a well; \* and the
pools are filled with water.\
7 They will go from strength to strength, \* and unto the God of gods
appeareth every one of them in Sion.\
8 O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; \* hearken, O God of Jacob.\
9 Behold, O God our defender, \* and look upon the face of thine
anointed.\
10 For one day in thy courts \* is better than a thousand.\
11 I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God, \* than to
dwell in the tents of ungodliness.\
12 For the LORD God is a light and defence; \* the LORD will give grace
and worship; and no good thing shall he withhold from them that live a
godly life.\
13 O LORD God of hosts, \* blessed is the man that putteth his trust in
thee.\

**Psalm 85. Benedixisti, Domine.**\
LORD, thou art become gracious unto thy land; \* thou hast turned away
the captivity of Jacob.\
2 Thou hast forgiven the offence of thy people, \* and covered all their
sins.\
3 Thou hast taken away all thy displeasure, \* and turned thyself from
thy wrathful indignation.\
4 Turn us then, O God our Saviour, \* and let thine anger cease from
us.\
5 Wilt thou be displeased at us for ever? \* and wilt thou stretch out
thy wrath from one generation to another?\
6 Wilt thou not turn again, and quicken us, \* that thy people may
rejoice in thee?\
7 Show us thy mercy, O LORD, \* and grant us thy salvation.\
8 I will hearken what the LORD God will say; \* for he shall speak peace
unto his people, and to his saints, that they turn not again unto
foolishness.\
9 For his salvation is nigh them that fear him; \* that glory may dwell
in our land.\
10 Mercy and truth are met together: \* righteousness and peace have
kissed each other.\
11 Truth shall flourish out of the earth, \* and righteousness hath
looked down from heaven.\
12 Yea, the LORD shall show loving-kindness; \* and our land shall give
her increase.\
13 Righteousness shall go before him, \* and shall direct his going in
the way.
