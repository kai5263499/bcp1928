The Collect.

![2](http://stats.superstats.com/b/ss/DAVIDMCMANNES/1){border="0"}

O ALMIGHTY God, who out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast
ordained strength, and madest infants to glorify thee by their deaths;
Mortify and kill all vices in us, and so strengthen us by thy grace,
that by the innocency of our lives, and constancy of our faith even unto
death, we may glorify thy holy Name; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
Amen.\

For the Epistle. Revelation xiv. 1.

I LOOKED, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an
hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father\'s name written in
their foreheads. And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many
waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of
harpers harping with their harps: and they sung as it were a new song
before the throne, and before the four living creatures, and the elders:
and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four
thousand, which were redeemed from the earth. These are they which were
not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which
follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among
men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb. And in their mouth
was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of
God.\

The Gospel. St. Matthew ii. 13.

THE angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and
take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou
there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to
destroy him. When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by
night, and departed into Egypt: and was there until the death of Herod:
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet,
saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son. Then Herod, when he saw that
he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and
slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts
thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he
had diligently enquired of the wise men. Then was fulfilled that which
was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, In Rama was there a voice
heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for
her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.
