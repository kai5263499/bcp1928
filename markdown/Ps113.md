| **Psalm 113. Laudate, pueri.**\                                       |
| PRAISE the LORD, ye servants; \* O praise the Name of the LORD.\      |
| 2 Blessed be the Name of the LORD \* from this time forth for         |
| evermore.\                                                            |
| 3 The LORD\'S Name is praised \* from the rising up of the sun unto   |
| the going down of the same.\                                          |
| 4 The LORD is high above all nations, \* and his glory above the      |
| heavens.\                                                             |
| 5 Who is like unto the LORD our God, that hath his dwelling so high,  |
| \* and yet humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven   |
| and earth!\                                                           |
| 6 He taketh up the simple out of the dust, \* and lifteth the poor    |
| out of the mire;\                                                     |
| 7 That he may set him with the princes, \* even with the princes of   |
| his people.\                                                          |
| 8 He maketh the barren woman to keep house, \* and to be a joyful     |
| mother of children.                                                   |
