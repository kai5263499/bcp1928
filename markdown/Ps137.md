| **Psalm 137. Super flumina.**\                                        |
| BY the waters of Babylon we sat down and wept, \* when we remembered  |
| thee, O Sion.\                                                        |
| 2 As for our harps, we hanged them up \* upon the trees that are      |
| therein.\                                                             |
| 3 For they that led us away captive, required of us then a song, and  |
| melody in our heaviness: \* Sing us one of the songs of Sion.\        |
| 4 How shall we sing the LORD\'S song \* in a strange land?\           |
| 5 If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, \* let my right hand forget her      |
| cunning.\                                                             |
| 6 If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my   |
| mouth; \* yea, if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.\         |
| 7 Remember the children of Edom, O LORD, in the day of Jerusalem; \*  |
| how they said, Down with it, down with it, even to the ground.\       |
| 8 O daughter of Babylon, wasted with misery; \* yea, happy shall he   |
| be that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.\                       |
| 9 Blessed shall he be that taketh thy children, \* and throweth them  |
| against the stones.                                                   |
