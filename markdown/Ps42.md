| **Psalms 42. Quemadmodum.**\                                          |
| LIKE as the hart desireth the water-brooks, \* so longeth my soul     |
| after thee, O God.\                                                   |
| 2 My soul is athirst for God, yea, even for the living God: \* when   |
| shall I come to appear before the presence of God?\                   |
| 3 My tears have been my meat day and night, \* while they daily say   |
| unto me, Where is now thy God?\                                       |
| 4 Now when I think thereupon, I pour out my heart by myself; \* for I |
| went with the multitude, and brought them forth into the house of     |
| God;\                                                                 |
| 5 In the voice of praise and thanksgiving, \* among such as keep      |
| holy-day.\                                                            |
| 6 Why art thou so full of heaviness, O my soul? \* and why art thou   |
| so disquieted within me?\                                             |
| 7 O put thy trust in God; \* for I will yet thank him, which is the   |
| help of my countenance, and my God.\                                  |
| 8 My soul is vexed within me; \* therefore will I remember thee from  |
| the land of Jordan, from Hermon and the little hill.\                 |
| 9 One deep calleth another, because of the noise of thy water-floods; |
| \* all thy waves and storms are gone over me.\                        |
| 10 The LORD will grant his loving-kindness in the daytime; \* and in  |
| the night season will I sing of him, and make my prayer unto the God  |
| of my life.\                                                          |
| 11 I will say unto the God of my strength, Why hast thou forgotten    |
| me? \* why go I thus heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?\         |
| 12 My bones are smitten asunder as with a sword, \* while mine        |
| enemies that trouble me cast me in the teeth;\                        |
| 13 Namely, while they say daily unto me, \* Where is now thy God?\    |
| 14 Why art thou so vexed, O my soul? \* and why art thou so           |
| disquieted within me?\                                                |
| 15 O put thy trust in God; \* for I will yet thank him, which is the  |
| help of my countenance, and my God.                                   |
