**Psalm 59. Eripe me de inimicis.**\
DELIVER me from mine enemies, O God; \* defend me from them that rise up
against me.\
2 O deliver me from the wicked doers, \* and save me from the
blood-thirsty men.\
3 For lo, they lie waiting for my soul; \* the mighty men are gathered
against me, without any offence or fault of me, O LORD.\
4 They run and prepare themselves without my fault; \* arise thou
therefore to help me, and behold.\
5 Stand up, O LORD God of hosts, thou God of Israel, to visit all the
heathen, \* and be not merciful unto them that offend of malicious
wickedness.\
6 They go to and fro in the evening, \* they grin like a dog, and run
about through the city.\
7 Behold, they speak with their mouth, and swords are in their lips; \*
for who doth hear?\
8 But thou, O LORD, shalt have them in derision, \* and thou shalt laugh
all the heathen to scorn.\
9 My strength will I ascribe unto thee; \* for thou art the God of my
refuge.\
10 God showeth me his goodness plenteously; \* and God shall let me see
my desire upon mine enemies.\
11 Slay them not, lest my people forget it; \* but scatter them abroad
among the people, and put them down, O Lord our defence.\
12 For the sin of their mouth, and for the words of their lips, they
shall be taken in their pride: \* and why? their talk is of cursing and
lies.\
13 Consume them in thy wrath, consume them, that they may perish; \* and
know that it is God that ruleth in Jacob, and unto the ends of the
world.\
14 And in the evening they will return, \* grin like a dog, and will go
about the city.\
15 They will run here and there for meat, \* and grudge if they be not
satisfied.\
16 As for me, I will sing of thy power, and will praise thy mercy
betimes in the morning; \* for thou hast been my defence and refuge in
the day of my trouble.\
17 Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing; \* for thou, O God, art my
refuge, and my merciful God.\

**Psalm 60. Deus, repulisti nos.**\
O GOD, thou hast cast us out, and scattered us abroad; \* thou hast also
been displeased: O turn thee unto us again.\
2 Thou hast moved the land, and divided it: \* heal the sores thereof,
for it shaketh.\
3 Thou hast showed thy people heavy things; \* thou hast given us a
drink of deadly wine.\
4 Thou hast given a token for such as fear thee, \* that they may
triumph because of the truth.\
5 Therefore were thy beloved delivered; \* help me with thy right hand,
and hear me.\
6 God hath spoken in his holiness, I will rejoice, and divide Shechem,
\* and mete out the valley of Succoth.\
7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; \* Ephraim also is the strength
of my head; Judah is my law-giver;\
8 Moab is my wash-pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; \* Philistia,
be thou glad of me.\
9 Who will lead me into the strong city? \* who will bring me into
Edom?\
10 Hast not thou cast us out, O God? \* wilt not thou, O God, go out
with our hosts?\
11 O be thou our help in trouble; \* for vain is the help of man.\
12 Through God will we do great acts; \* for it is he that shall tread
down our enemies.\

**Psalm 61. Exaudi, Deus.**\
HEAR my crying, O God, \* give ear unto my prayer.\
2 From the ends of the earth will I call upon thee, \* when my heart is
in heaviness.\
3 O set me up upon the rock that is higher than I; \* for thou hast been
my hope, and a strong tower for me against the enemy.\
4 I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever, \* and my trust shall be
under the covering of thy wings.\
5 For thou, O Lord, hast heard my desires, \* and hast given an heritage
unto those that fear thy Name.\
6 Thou shalt grant the King a long life, \* that his years may endure
throughout all generations.\
7 He shall dwell before God for ever: \* O prepare thy loving mercy and
faithfulness, that they may preserve him.\
8 So will I alway sing praise unto thy Name, \* that I may daily perform
my vows.
