| 1 And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree     |
| from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.\            |
| 2 (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of       |
| Syria.)\                                                              |
| 3 And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.\             |
| 4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth,  |
| into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem;       |
| (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)\                  |
| 5 To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.\   |
| 6 And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were           |
| accomplished that she should be delivered.\                           |
| 7 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in         |
| swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no     |
| room for them in the inn.\                                            |
| 8 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field,  |
| keeping watch over their flock by night.\                             |
| 9 And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the |
| Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.\              |
| 10 And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you   |
| good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.\             |
| 11 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour,      |
| which is Christ the Lord.\                                            |
| 12 And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped  |
| in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.\                             |
| 13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly  |
| host praising God, and saying,\                                       |
| 14 Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward  |
| men.\                                                                 |
| 15 And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into   |
| heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto    |
| Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord   |
| hath made known unto us.\                                             |
| 16 And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe |
| lying in a manger.\                                                   |
| 17 And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which |
| was told them concerning this child.\                                 |
| 18 And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were     |
| told them by the shepherds.\                                          |
| 19 But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.\   |
| 20 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all    |
| the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.\   |

| 7 Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him  |
| with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy        |

| 9 But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for   |
| the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the |
| grace of God should taste death for every man.\                       |

| things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of      |
| their salvation perfect through sufferings.\                          |
| 11 For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all   |

| 12 Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of  |
| the church will I sing praise unto thee.\                             |

| children which God hath given me.\                                    |
| 14 Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood,   |
| he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he |
| might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;\   |
| []{#anchor73066}15 And deliver them who through fear of death were    |
| all their lifetime subject to bondage.\                               |
| 16 For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on |
| him the seed of Abraham.\                                             |
| 17 Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his    |

| things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the  |
| people.\                                                              |

| 13 But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any  |
| of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.\                 |
| 14 For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of   |

| 15 While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not     |
| your hearts, as in the provocation.\                                  |
| 16 For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that   |
| came out of Egypt by Moses.\                                          |
| 17 But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them     |

| the middle wall of partition between us;\                             |
| 15 Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of          |
| commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain |
| one new man, so making peace;\                                        |
