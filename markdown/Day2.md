| **Psalm 9. Confitebor tibi.**\                                        |
| I WILL give thanks unto thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; \* I will  |
| speak of all thy marvellous works.\                                   |
| 2 I will be glad and rejoice in thee; \* yea, my songs will I make of |
| thy Name, O thou Most Highest.\                                       |
| 3 While mine enemies are driven back, \* they shall fall and perish   |
| at thy presence.\                                                     |
| 4 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; \* thou art set in  |
| the throne that judgest right.\                                       |
| 5 Thou hast rebuked the heathen, and destroyed the ungodly; \* thou   |
| hast put out their name for ever and ever.\                           |
| 6 O thou enemy, thy destructions are come to a perpetual end; \* even |
| as the cities which thou hast destroyed, whose memorial is perished   |
| with them.\                                                           |
| 7 But the LORD shall endure for ever; \* he hath also prepared his    |
| seat for judgment.\                                                   |
| 8 For he shall judge the world in righteousness, \* and minister true |
| judgment unto the people.\                                            |
| 9 The LORD also will be a defence for the oppressed, \* even a refuge |
| in due time of trouble.\                                              |
| 10 And they that know thy Name will put their trust in thee; \* for   |
| thou, LORD, hast never failed them that seek thee.\                   |
| 11 O praise the LORD which dwelleth in Sion; \* show the people of    |
| his doings.\                                                          |
| 12 For when he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them, \*  |
| and forgetteth not the complaint of the poor.\                        |
| 13 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider the trouble which I suffer of |
| them that hate me, \* thou that liftest me up from the gates of       |
| death;\                                                               |
| 14 That I may show all thy praises within the gates of the daughter   |
| of Sion: \* I will rejoice in thy salvation.\                         |
| 15 The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made; \* in the     |
| same net which they hid privily is their foot taken.\                 |
| 16 The LORD is known to execute judgment; \* the ungodly is trapped   |
| in the work of his own hands.\                                        |
| 17 The wicked shall be turned to destruction, \* and all the people   |
| that forget God.\                                                     |
| 18 For the poor shall not alway be forgotten; \* the patient abiding  |
| of the meek shall not perish for ever.\                               |
| 19 UP, LORD, and let not man have the upper hand; \* let the heathen  |
| be judged in thy sight.\                                              |
| 20 Put them in fear, O LORD, \* that the heathen may know themselves  |
| to be but men.\                                                       |
| \                                                                     |
| **\                                                                   |
| Psalm 10. Ut quid, Domine ?**\                                        |
| WHY standest thou so far off, O LORD, \* and hidest thy face in the   |
| needful time of trouble?\                                             |
| 2 The ungodly, for his own lust, doth persecute the poor: \* let them |
| be taken in the crafty wiliness that they have imagined.\             |
| 3 For the ungodly hath made boast of his own heart\'s desire, \* and  |
| speaketh good of the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.\              |
| 4 The ungodly is so proud, that he careth not for God, \* neither is  |
| God in all his thoughts.\                                             |
| 5 His ways are alway grievous; \* thy judgments are far above out of  |
| his sight, and therefore defieth he all his enemies.\                 |
| 6 For he hath said in his heart, Tush, I shall never be cast down, \* |
| there shall no harm happen unto me.\                                  |
| 7 His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and fraud; \* under his       |
| tongue is ungodliness and vanity.\                                    |
| 8 He sitteth lurking in the thievish corners of the streets, \* and   |
| privily in his lurking dens doth he murder the innocent; his eyes are |
| set against the poor.\                                                |
| 9 For he lieth waiting secretly; even as a lion lurketh he in his     |
| den, \* that he may ravish the poor.\                                 |
| 10 He doth ravish the poor, \* when he getteth him into his net.\     |
| 11 He falleth down, and humbleth himself, \* that the congregation of |
| the poor may fall into the hands of his captains.\                    |
| 12 He hath said in his heart, Tush, God hath forgotten; \* he hideth  |
| away his face, and he will never see it.\                             |
| 13 Arise, O LORD God, and lift up thine hand; \* forget not the       |
| poor.\                                                                |
| 14 Wherefore should the wicked blaspheme God, \* while he doth say in |
| his heart, Tush, thou God carest not for it?\                         |
| 15 Surely thou hast seen it; \* for thou beholdest ungodliness and    |
| wrong, that thou mayest take the matter into thy hand.\               |
| 16 The poor committeth himself unto thee; \* for thou art the helper  |
| of the friendless.\                                                   |
| 17 Break thou the power of the ungodly and malicious; \* search out   |
| his ungodliness, until thou find none.\                               |
| 18 The LORD is King for ever and ever, \* and the heathen are         |
| perished out of the land.\                                            |
| 19 LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the poor; \* thou preparest    |
| their heart, and thine ear hearkeneth;\                               |
| 20 To help the fatherless and poor unto their right, \* that the man  |
| of the earth be no more exalted against them.\                        |
| **\                                                                   |
| Psalm 11. In Domino confido.**\                                       |
| IN the LORD put I my trust; \* how say ye then to my soul, that she   |
| should flee as a bird unto the hill?\                                 |
| 2 For lo, the ungodly bend their bow, and make ready their arrows     |
| within the quiver, \* that they may privily shoot at them which are   |
| true of heart.\                                                       |
| 3 If the foundations be destroyed, \* what can the righteous do?\     |
| 4 The LORD is in his holy temple; \* the LORD\'S seat is in heaven.\  |
| 5 His eyes consider the poor, \* and his eyelids try the children of  |
| men.\                                                                 |
| 6 The LORD approveth the righteous: \* but the ungodly, and him that  |
| delighteth in wickedness, doth his soul abhor.\                       |
| 7 Upon the ungodly he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, storm    |
| and tempest: \* this shall be their portion to drink.\                |
| 8 For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; \* his countenance     |
| will behold the thing that is just.\                                  |
|                                                                       |
| []{#anchor428134}Evening Prayer.                                      |
|                                                                       |
| **Psalm 12. Salvum me fac.**\                                         |
| HELP me, LORD, for there is not one godly man left; \* for the        |
| faithful are minished from among the children of men.\                |
| 2 They talk of vanity every one with his neighbour; \* they do but    |
| flatter with their lips, and dissemble in their double heart.\        |
| 3 The LORD shall root out all deceitful lips, \* and the tongue that  |
| speaketh proud things;\                                               |
| 4 Which have said, With our tongue will we prevail; \* we are they    |
| that ought to speak; who is lord over us?\                            |
| 5 Now, for the comfortless troubles\' sake of the needy, \* and       |
| because of the deep sighing of the poor,\                             |
| 6 I will up, saith the LORD; \* and will help every one from him that |
| swelleth against him, and will set him at rest.\                      |
| 7 The words of the LORD are pure words; \* even as the silver which   |
| from the earth is tried, and purified seven times in the fire.\       |
| 8 Thou shalt keep them, O LORD; \* thou shalt preserve them from this |
| generation for ever.\                                                 |
| 9 The ungodly walk on every side: \* when they are exalted, the       |
| children of men are put to rebuke.\                                   |
| **\                                                                   |
| Psalm 13. Usquequo, Domine?**\                                        |
| HOW long wilt thou forget me, O LORD; for ever? \* how long wilt thou |
| hide thy face from me?\                                               |
| 2 How long shall I seek counsel in my soul, and be so vexed in my     |
| heart? \* how long shall mine enemy triumph over me?\                 |
| 3 Consider, and hear me, O LORD my God; \* lighten mine eyes, that I  |
| sleep not in death;\                                                  |
| 4 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him: \* for if I be   |
| cast down, they that trouble me will rejoice at it.\                  |
| 5 But my trust is in thy mercy, \* and my heart is joyful in thy      |
| salvation.\                                                           |
| 6 I will sing of the LORD, because he hath dealt so lovingly with me; |
| \* yea, I will praise the Name of the Lord Most Highest.\             |
| \                                                                     |
| **\                                                                   |
| Psalm 14. Dixit insipiens.**\                                         |
| THE fool hath said in his heart, \* There is no God.\                 |
| 2 They are corrupt, and become abominable in their doings; \* there   |
| is none that doeth good, no not one.\                                 |
| 3 The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, \* to    |
| see if there were any that would understand, and seek after God.\     |
| 4 But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become    |
| abominable; \* there is none that doeth good, no not one.\            |
| 5 Have they no knowledge, that they are all such workers of mischief, |
| \* eating up my people as it were bread, and call not upon the LORD?\ |
| 6 There were they brought in great fear, even where no fear was; \*   |
| for God is in the generation of the righteous.\                       |
| 7 As for you, ye have made a mock at the counsel of the poor; \*      |
| because he putteth his trust in the LORD.\                            |
| 8 Who shall give salvation unto Israel out of Sion? \* When the LORD  |
| turneth the captivity of his people, then shall Jacob rejoice, and    |
| Israel shall be glad.                                                 |
|                                                                       |
