| **Psalm 124. Nisi quia Dominus.**\                                    |
| IF the LORD himself had not been on our side, now may Israel say; \*  |
| if the LORD himself had not been on our side, when men rose up        |
| against us;\                                                          |
| 2 They had swallowed us up alive; \* when they were so wrathfully     |
| displeased at us.\                                                    |
| 3 Yea, the waters had drowned us, \* and the stream had gone over our |
| soul.\                                                                |
| 4 The deep waters of the proud \* had gone even over our soul.\       |
| 5 But praised be the LORD, \* who hath not given us over for a prey   |
| unto their teeth.\                                                    |
| 6 Our soul is escaped even as a bird out of the snare of the fowler;  |
| \* the snare is broken, and we are delivered.\                        |
| 7 Our help standeth in the Name of the LORD, \* who hath made heaven  |
| and earth.                                                            |
