The Collect.

![](http://stats.superstats.com/b/ss/DAVIDMCMANNES/1){border="0"}

O LORD, from whom all good things do come; Grant to us thy humble
servants, that by thy holy inspiration we may think those things that
are good, and by thy merciful guiding may perform the same; through our
Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.\

The Epistle. St. James i. 22.

BE ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own
selves. For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like
unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass: for he beholdeth
himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of
man he was. But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and
continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the
work, this man shall be blessed in his deed. If any man among you seem
to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own
heart, this man\'s religion is vain. Pure religion and undefiled before
God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their
affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.\

The Gospel. St. John xvi. 23.

VERILY, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my
name, he will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name:
ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full. These things have
I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more
speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.
At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will
pray the Father for you: for the Father himself loveth you, because ye
have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God. I came forth
from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world,
and go to the Father. His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou
plainly, and speakest no proverb. Now are we sure that thou knowest all
things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe
that thou camest forth from God. Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?
Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered,
every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone,
because the Father is with me. These things I have spoken unto you, that
in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but
be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.
