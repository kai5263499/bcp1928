**Psalm 106. Confitemini Domino.**\
O GIVE thanks unto the LORD; for he is gracious, \* and his mercy
endureth for ever.\
2 Who can express the noble acts of the LORD, \* or show forth all his
praise?\
3 Blessed are they that alway keep judgment, \* and do righteousness.\
4 Remember me, O LORD, according to the favour that thou bearest unto
thy people; \* O visit me with thy salvation;\
5 That I may see the felicity of thy chosen, \* and rejoice in the
gladness of thy people, and give thanks with thine inheritance.\
6 We have sinned with our fathers; \* we have done amiss, and dealt
wickedly.\
7 Our fathers regarded not thy wonders in Egypt, neither kept they thy
great goodness in remembrance; \* but were disobedient at the sea, even
at the Red Sea.\
8 Nevertheless, he helped them for his Name\'s sake, \* that he might
make his power to be known.\
9 He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up; \* so he led them
through the deep, as through a wilderness.\
10 And he saved them from the adversary\'s hand, \* and delivered them
from the hand of the enemy.\
11 As for those that troubled them, the waters overwhelmed them; \*
there was not one of them left.\
12 Then believed they his words, \* and sang praise unto him.\
13 But within a while they forgat his works, \* and would not abide his
counsel.\
14 But lust came upon them in the wilderness, \* and they tempted God in
the desert.\
15 And he gave them their desire, \* and sent leanness withal into their
soul.\
16 They angered Moses also in the tents, \* and Aaron the saint of the
LORD.\
17 So the earth opened, and swallowed up Dathan, \* and covered the
congregation of Abiram.\
18 And the fire was kindled in their company; \* the flame burnt up the
ungodly.\
19 They made a calf in Horeb, \* and worshipped the molten image.\
20 Thus they turned their glory \* into the similitude of a calf that
eateth hay.\
21 And they forgat God their Saviour, \* who had done so great things in
Egypt;\
22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham; \* and fearful things by the Red
Sea.\
23 So he said he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his chosen
stood before him in the gap, \* to turn away his wrathful indignation,
lest he should destroy them.\
24 Yea, they thought scorn of that pleasant land, \* and gave no
credence unto his word;\
25 But murmured in their tents, \* and hearkened not unto the voice of
the LORD.\
26 Then lift he up his hand against them, \* to overthrow them in the
wilderness;\
27 To cast out their seed among the nations, \* and to scatter them in
the lands.\
28 They joined themselves unto Baal-peor, \* and ate the offerings of
the dead.\
29 Thus they provoked him to anger with their own inventions; \* and the
plague was great among them.\
30 Then stood up Phinehas, and interposed; \* and so the plague ceased.\
31 And that was counted unto him for righteousness, \* among all
posterities for evermore.\
32 They angered him also at the waters of strife, \* so that he punished
Moses for their sakes;\
33 Because they provoked his spirit, \* so that he spake unadvisedly
with his lips.\
34 Neither destroyed they the heathen, \* as the LORD commanded them;\
35 But were mingled among the heathen, \* and learned their works.\
36 Insomuch that they worshipped their idols, which became a snare unto
them; \* yea, they offered their sons and their daughters unto devils;\
37 And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their
daughters, \* whom they offered unto the idols of Canaan; and the land
was defiled with blood.\
38 Thus were they stained with their own works, \* and went a whoring
with their own inventions.\
39 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, \*
insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.\
40 And he gave them over into the hand of the heathen; \* and they that
hated them were lords over them.\
41 Their enemies oppressed them, \* and had them in subjection.\
42 Many a time did he deliver them; \* but they rebelled against him
with their own inventions, and were brought down in their wickedness.\
43 Nevertheless, when he saw their adversity, \* he heard their
complaint.\
44 He thought upon his covenant, and pitied them, according unto the
multitude of his mercies; \* yea, he made all those that led them away
captive to pity them.\
45 Deliver us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen; \*
that we may give thanks unto thy holy Name, and make our boast of thy
praise.\
46 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, from everlasting, and world
without end; \* And let all the people say, Amen.
