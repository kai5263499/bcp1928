| **Psalms 14. Dixit insipiens.**\                                      |
| THE fool hath said in his heart, \* There is no God.\                 |
| 2 They are corrupt, and become abominable in their doings; \* there   |
| is none that doeth good, no not one.\                                 |
| 3 The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, \* to    |
| see if there were any that would understand, and seek after God.\     |
| 4 But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become    |
| abominable; \* there is none that doeth good, no not one.\            |
| 5 Have they no knowledge, that they are all such workers of mischief, |
| \* eating up my people as it were bread, and call not upon the LORD?\ |
| 6 There were they brought in great fear, even where no fear was; \*   |
| for God is in the generation of the righteous.\                       |
| 7 As for you, ye have made a mock at the counsel of the poor; \*      |
| because he putteth his trust in the LORD.\                            |
| 8 Who shall give salvation unto Israel out of Sion? \* When the LORD  |
| turneth the captivity of his people, then shall Jacob rejoice, and    |
| Israel shall be glad.                                                 |
