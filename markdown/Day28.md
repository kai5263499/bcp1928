| **Psalm 132. Memento, Domine.**\                                      |
| LORD, remember David, \* and all his trouble:\                        |
| 2 How he sware unto the LORD, \* and vowed a vow unto the Almighty    |
| God of Jacob:\                                                        |
| 3 I will not come within the tabernacle of mine house, \* nor climb   |
| up into my bed;\                                                      |
| 4 I will not suffer mine eyes to sleep, nor mine eyelids to slumber;  |
| \* neither the temples of my head to take any rest;\                  |
| 5 Until I find out a place for the temple of the LORD; \* an          |
| habitation for the Mighty God of Jacob.\                              |
| 6 Lo, we heard of the same at Ephratah, \* and found it in the wood.\ |
| 7 We will go into his tabernacle, \* and fall low on our knees before |
| his footstool.\                                                       |
| 8 Arise, O LORD, into thy resting-place; \* thou, and the ark of thy  |
| strength.\                                                            |
| 9 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; \* and let thy       |
| saints sing with joyfulness.\                                         |
| 10 For thy servant David\'s sake, \* turn not away the face of thine  |
| anointed.\                                                            |
| 11 The LORD hath made a faithful oath unto David, \* and he shall not |
| shrink from it:\                                                      |
| 12 Of the fruit of thy body \* shall I set upon thy throne.\          |
| 13 If thy children will keep my covenant, and my testimonies that I   |
| shall teach them; \* their children also shall sit upon thy throne    |
| for evermore.\                                                        |
| 14 For the LORD hath chosen Sion to be an habitation for himself; \*  |
| he hath longed for her.\                                              |
| 15 This shall be my rest for ever: \* here will I dwell, for I have a |
| delight therein.\                                                     |
| 16 I will bless her victuals with increase, \* and will satisfy her   |
| poor with bread.\                                                     |
| 17 I will deck her priests with health, \* and her saints shall       |
| rejoice and sing.\                                                    |
| 18 There shall I make the horn of David to flourish: \* I have        |
| ordained a lantern for mine anointed.\                                |
| 19 As for his enemies, I shall clothe them with shame; \* but upon    |
| himself shall his crown flourish.\                                    |
| \                                                                     |

| Psalm 133. Ecce, quam bonum!**\                                       |
| BEHOLD, how good and joyful a thing it is, \* for brethren to dwell   |
| together in unity!\                                                   |
| 2 It is like the precious oil upon the head, that ran down unto the   |
| beard, \* even unto Aaron\'s beard, and went down to the skirts of    |
| his clothing.\                                                        |
| 3 Like as the dew of Hermon, \* which fell upon the hill of Sion.\    |
| 4 For there the LORD promised his blessing, \* and life for           |
| evermore.\                                                            |
| \                                                                     |

| Psalm 134. Ecce nunc.**\                                              |
| BEHOLD now, praise the LORD, \* all ye servants of the LORD;\         |
| 2 Ye that by night stand in the house of the LORD, \* even in the     |
| courts of the house of our God.\                                      |
| 3 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, \* and praise the LORD.\       |
| 4 The LORD that made heaven and earth \* give thee blessing out of    |
| Sion.\                                                                |

| Psalm 135. Laudate Nomen.**\                                          |
| O PRAISE the LORD, laud ye the Name of the LORD; \* praise it, O ye   |
| servants of the LORD;\                                                |
| 2 Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, \* in the courts of the     |
| house of our God.\                                                    |
| 3 O praise the LORD, for the LORD is gracious; \* O sing praises unto |
| his Name, for it is lovely.\                                          |
| 4 For why? the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, \* and Israel for |
| his own possession.\                                                  |
| 5 For I know that the LORD is great, \* and that our Lord is above    |
| all gods.\                                                            |
| 6 Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth;   |
| \* and in the sea, and in all deep places.\                           |
| 7 He bringeth forth the clouds from the ends of the world, \* and     |
| sendeth forth lightnings with the rain, bringing the winds out of his |
| treasuries.\                                                          |
| 8 He smote the firstborn of Egypt, \* both of man and beast.\         |
| 9 He hath sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O thou land |
| of Egypt; \* upon Pharaoh, and all his servants.\                     |
| 10 He smote divers nations, \* and slew mighty kings:\                |
| 11 Sihon, king of the Amorites; and Og, the king of Bashan; \* and    |
| all the kingdoms of Canaan;\                                          |
| 12 And gave their land to be an heritage, \* even an heritage unto    |
| Israel his people.\                                                   |
| 13 Thy Name, O LORD, endureth for ever; \* so doth thy memorial, O    |
| LORD, from one generation to another.\                                |
| 14 For the LORD will avenge his people, \* and be gracious unto his   |
| servants.\                                                            |
| 15 As for the images of the heathen, they are but silver and gold; \* |
| the work of men\'s hands.\                                            |
| 16 They have mouths, and speak not; \* eyes have they, but they see   |
| not.\                                                                 |
| 17 They have ears, and yet they hear not; \* neither is there any     |
| breath in their mouths.\                                              |
| 18 They that make them are like unto them; \* and so are all they     |
| that put their trust in them.\                                        |
| 19 Praise the LORD, ye house of Israel; \* praise the LORD, ye house  |
| of Aaron.\                                                            |

| I WILL give thanks unto thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; \* even    |
| before the gods will I sing praise unto thee.\                        |
| 2 I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy Name, because |
| of thy loving-kindness and truth; \* for thou hast magnified thy      |
| Name, and thy word, above all things.\                                |
| 3 When I called upon thee, thou heardest me; \* and enduedst my soul  |
| with much strength.\                                                  |
| 4 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD; \* for they   |
| have heard the words of thy mouth.\                                   |
| 5 Yea, they shall sing of the ways of the LORD, \* that great is the  |
| glory of the LORD.\                                                   |
| 6 For though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly; \* |
| as for the proud, he beholdeth them afar off.\                        |
| 7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, yet shalt thou refresh me;   |
| \* thou shalt stretch forth thy hand upon the furiousness of mine     |
| enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.\                           |
| 8 The LORD shall make good his loving-kindness toward me; \* yea, thy |
| mercy, O LORD, endureth for ever; despise not then the works of thine |
| own hands.                                                            |
