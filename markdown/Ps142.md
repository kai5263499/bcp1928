| **Psalm 142. Voce mea ad Dominum.**\                                  |
| I CRIED unto the LORD with my voice; \* yea, even unto the LORD did I |
| make my supplication.\                                                |
| 2 I poured out my complaints before him, \* and showed him of my      |
| trouble.\                                                             |
| 3 When my spirit was in heaviness, thou knewest my path; \* in the    |
| way wherein I walked, have they privily laid a snare for me.\         |
| 4 I looked also upon my right hand, \* and saw there was no man that  |
| would know me.\                                                       |
| 5 I had no place to flee unto, \* and no man cared for my soul.\      |
| 6 I cried unto thee, O LORD, and said, \* Thou art my hope, and my    |
| portion in the land of the living.\                                   |
| 7 Consider my complaint; \* for I am brought very low.\               |
| 8 O deliver me from my persecutors; \* for they are too strong for    |
| me.\                                                                  |
| 9 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks unto thy Name;  |
| \* which thing if thou wilt grant me, then shall the righteous resort |
| unto my company.                                                      |
