| PSALM +\                                                              |
| \                                                                     |
|                                                                       |
| **Psalms 35. Judica, Domine.**\                                       |
| PLEAD thou my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me, \* and    |
| fight thou against them that fight against me.\                       |
| 2 Lay hand upon the shield and buckler, \* and stand up to help me.\  |
| 3 Bring forth the spear, and stop the way against them that pursue    |
| me: \* say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.\                         |
| 4 Let them be confounded, and put to shame, that seek after my soul;  |
| \* let them be turned back, and brought to confusion, that imagine    |
| mischief for me.\                                                     |
| 5 Let them be as the dust before the wind, \* and the angel of the    |
| LORD scattering them.\                                                |
| 6 Let their way be dark and slippery, \* and let the angel of the     |
| LORD pursue them.\                                                    |
| 7 For they have privily laid their net to destroy me without a cause; |
| \* yea, even without a cause have they made a pit for my soul.\       |
| 8 Let a sudden destruction come upon him unawares, and his net that   |
| he hath laid privily catch himself; \* that he may fall into his own  |
| mischief.\                                                            |
| 9 And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD; \* it shall rejoice in his |
| salvation.\                                                           |
| 10 All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, who           |
| deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him; \* yea, the  |
| poor, and him that is in misery, from him that spoileth him?\         |
| 11 False witnesses did rise up: \* they laid to my charge things that |
| I knew not.\                                                          |
| 12 They rewarded me evil for good, \* to the great discomfort of my   |
| soul.\                                                                |
| 13 Nevertheless, when they were sick, I put on sackcloth, and humbled |
| my soul with fasting; \* and my prayer shall turn into mine own       |
| bosom.\                                                               |
| 14 I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother; \* |
| I went heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.\                 |
| 15 But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves       |
| together; \* yea, the very abjects came together against me unawares, |
| making mouths at me, and ceased not.\                                 |
| 16 With the flatterers were busy mockers, \* who gnashed upon me with |
| their teeth.\                                                         |
| 17 Lord, how long wilt thou look upon this? \* O deliver my soul from |
| the calamities which they bring on me, and my darling from the        |
| lions.\                                                               |
| 18 So will I give thee thanks in the great congregation; \* I will    |
| praise thee among much people.\                                       |
| 19 O let not them that are mine enemies triumph over me ungodly; \*   |
| neither let them wink with their eyes, that hate me without a cause.\ |
| 20 And why? their communing is not for peace; \* but they imagine     |
| deceitful words against them that are quiet in the land.\             |
| 21 They gaped upon me with their mouths, and said, \* Fie on thee!    |
| fie on thee! we saw it with our eyes.\                                |
| 22 This thou hast seen, O LORD; \* hold not thy tongue then; go not   |
| far from me, O Lord.\                                                 |
| 23 Awake, and stand up to judge my quarrel; \* avenge thou my cause,  |
| my God and my Lord.\                                                  |
| 24 Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; \* and    |
| let them not triumph over me.\                                        |
| 25 Let them not say in their hearts, There! there! so would we have   |
| it; \* neither let them say, We have devoured him.\                   |
| 26 Let them be put to confusion and shame together, that rejoice at   |
| my trouble; \* let them be clothed with rebuke and dishonour, that    |
| boast themselves against me.\                                         |
| 27 Let them be glad and rejoice, that favour my righteous dealing; \* |
| yea, let them say alway, Blessed be the LORD, who hath pleasure in    |
| the prosperity of his servant.\                                       |
| 28 And as for my tongue, it shall be talking of thy righteousness, \* |
| and of thy praise, all the day long.                                  |
