| **Psalm 44. Deus, auribus.**\                                         |
| WE have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us \* what  |
| thou hast done in their time of old:\                                 |
| 2 How thou hast driven out the heathen with thy hand, and planted our |
| fathers in; \* how thou hast destroyed the nations, and made thy      |
| people to flourish.\                                                  |
| 3 For they gat not the land in possession through their own sword, \* |
| neither was it their own arm that helped them;\                       |
| 4 But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy             |
| countenance; \* because thou hadst a favour unto them.\               |
| 5 Thou art my King, O God; \* send help unto Jacob.\                  |
| 6 Through thee will we overthrow our enemies, \* and in thy Name will |
| we tread them under that rise up against us.\                         |
| 7 For I will not trust in my bow, \* it is not my sword that shall    |
| help me;\                                                             |
| 8 But it is thou that savest us from our enemies, \* and puttest them |
| to confusion that hate us.\                                           |
| 9 We make our boast of God all day long, \* and will praise thy Name  |
| for ever.\                                                            |
| 10 But now thou art far off, and puttest us to confusion, \* and      |
| goest not forth with our armies.\                                     |
| 11 Thou makest us to turn our backs upon our enemies, \* so that they |
| which hate us spoil our goods.\                                       |
| 12 Thou lettest us be eaten up like sheep, \* and hast scattered us   |
| among the heathen.\                                                   |
| 13 Thou sellest thy people for nought, \* and takest no money for     |
| them.\                                                                |
| 14 Thou makest us to be rebuked of our neighbours, \* to be laughed   |
| to scorn, and had in derision of them that are round about us.\       |
| 15 Thou makest us to be a by-word among the nations, \* and that the  |
| peoples shake their heads at us.\                                     |
| 16 My confusion is daily before me, \* and the shame of my face hath  |
| covered me;\                                                          |
| 17 For the voice of the slanderer and blasphemer, \* for the enemy    |
| and avenger.\                                                         |
| 18 And though all this be come upon us, yet do we not forget thee, \* |
| nor behave ourselves frowardly in thy covenant.\                      |
| 19 Our heart is not turned back, \* neither our steps gone out of thy |
| way;\                                                                 |
| 20 No, not when thou hast smitten us into the place of dragons, \*    |
| and covered us with the shadow of death.\                             |
| 21 If we have forgotten the Name of our God, and holden up our hands  |
| to any strange god, \* shall not God search it out? for he knoweth    |
| the very secrets of the heart.\                                       |
| 22 For thy sake also are we killed all the day long, \* and are       |
| counted as sheep appointed to be slain.\                              |
| 23 Up, Lord, why sleepest thou? \* awake, and be not absent from us   |
| for ever.\                                                            |
| 24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, \* and forgettest our misery and   |
| trouble?\                                                             |
| 25 For our soul is brought low, even unto the dust; \* our belly      |
| cleaveth unto the ground.\                                            |
| 26 Arise, and help us, \* and deliver us, for thy mercy\'s sake.\     |
| \                                                                     |
| **\                                                                   |
| Psalm 45. Eructavit cor meum.**\                                      |
| MY heart overfloweth with a good matter; I speak the things which I   |
| have made concerning the King. \* My tongue is the pen of a ready     |
| writer.\                                                              |
| 2 Thou art fairer than the children of men; \* full of grace are thy  |
| lips, because God hath blessed thee for ever.\                        |
| 3 Gird thee with thy sword upon thy thigh, O thou Most Mighty, \*     |
| according to thy worship and renown.\                                 |
| 4 Good luck have thou with thine honour: \* ride on, because of the   |
| word of truth, of meekness, and righteousness; and thy right hand     |
| shall teach thee terrible things.\                                    |
| 5 Thy arrows are very sharp in the heart of the King\'s enemies, \*   |
| and the people shall be subdued unto thee.\                           |
| 6 Thy seat, O God, endureth for ever; \* the sceptre of thy kingdom   |
| is a right sceptre.\                                                  |
| 7 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; \* wherefore     |
| God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above  |
| thy fellows.\                                                         |
| 8 All thy garments smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia; \* out of the   |
| ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.\                     |
| 9 Kings\' daughters are among thy honourable women; \* upon thy right |
| hand doth stand the queen in a vesture of gold, wrought about with    |
| divers colours.\                                                      |
| 10 Hearken, O daughter, and consider; incline thine ear; \* forget    |
| also thine own people, and thy father\'s house.\                      |
| 11 So shall the King have pleasure in thy beauty; \* for he is thy    |
| Lord, and worship thou him.\                                          |
| 12 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; \* like as    |
| the rich also among the people shall make their supplication before   |
| thee.\                                                                |
| 13 The King\'s daughter is all glorious within; \* her clothing is of |
| wrought gold.\                                                        |
| 14 She shall be brought unto the King in raiment of needlework: \*    |
| the virgins that be her fellows shall bear her company, and shall be  |
| brought unto thee.\                                                   |
| 15 With joy and gladness shall they be brought, \* and shall enter    |
| into the King\'s palace.\                                             |
| 16 Instead of thy fathers, thou shalt have children, \* whom thou     |
| mayest make princes in all lands.\                                    |
| 17 I will make thy Name to be remembered from one generation to       |
| another; \* therefore shall the people give thanks unto thee, world   |
| without end.\                                                         |

| Psalm 46. Deus noster refugium.**\                                    |
| GOD is our hope and strength, \* a very present help in trouble.\     |
| 2 Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be moved, \* and       |
| though the hills be carried into the midst of the sea;\               |
| 3 Though the waters thereof rage and swell, \* and though the         |
| mountains shake at the tempest of the same.\                          |
| 4 There is a river, the streams whereof make glad the city of God; \* |
| the holy place of the tabernacle of the Most Highest.\                |
| 5 God is in the midst of her, therefore shall she not be removed; \*  |
| God shall help her, and that right early.\                            |
| 6 The nations make much ado, and the kingdoms are moved; \* but God   |
| hath showed his voice, and the earth shall melt away.\                |
| 7 The LORD of hosts is with us; \* the God of Jacob is our refuge.\   |
| 8 O come hither, and behold the works of the LORD, \* what            |
| destruction he hath brought upon the earth.\                          |
| 9 He maketh wars to cease in all the world; \* he breaketh the bow,   |
| and knappeth the spear in sunder, and burneth the chariots in the     |
| fire.\                                                                |
| 10 Be still then, and know that I am God: \* I will be exalted among  |
| the nations, and I will be exalted in the earth.\                     |
| 11 The LORD of hosts is with us; \* the God of Jacob is our refuge.\  |

| known in her palaces as a sure refuge.\                               |
| 3 For lo, the kings of the earth \* were gathered, and gone by        |

| understanding.\                                                       |
| 4 I will incline mine ear to the parable, \* and show my dark speech  |
| upon the harp.\                                                       |
| 5 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, \* when wickedness at  |
| my heels compasseth me round about?\                                  |
| 6 There be some that put their trust in their goods, \* and boast     |
| themselves in the multitude of their riches.\                         |
| 7 But no man may deliver his brother, \* nor give a ransom unto God   |
| for him,\                                                             |
| 8 (For it cost more to redeem their souls, \* so that he must let     |
| that alone for ever;)\                                                |
| 9 That he shall live alway, \* and not see the grave.\                |
| 10 For he seeth that wise men also die and perish together, \* as     |
| well as the ignorant and foolish, and leave their riches for other.\  |
| 11 And yet they think that their houses shall continue for ever, and  |
| that their dwelling-places shall endure from one generation to        |
| another; \* and call the lands after their own names.\                |
| 12 Nevertheless, man being in honour abideth not, \* seeing he may be |
| compared unto the beasts that perish;\                                |
| 13 This their way is very foolishness; \* yet their posterity praise  |
| their saying.\                                                        |
| 14 They lie in the grave like sheep; death is their shepherd; and the |
| righteous shall have dominion over them in the morning: \* their      |
| beauty shall consume in the sepulchre, and have no abiding.\          |
| 15 But God hath delivered my soul from the power of the grave; \* for |
| he shall receive me.\                                                 |
| 16 Be not thou afraid, though one be made rich, \* or if the glory of |
| his house be increased;\                                              |
| 17 For he shall carry nothing away with him when he dieth, \* neither |
| shall his pomp follow him.\                                           |
| 18 For while he lived, he counted himself an happy man; \* and so     |
| long as thou doest well unto thyself, men will speak good of thee.\   |
| 19 He shall follow the generation of his fathers, \* and shall never  |
| see light.\                                                           |
| 20 Man that is in honour but hath no understanding \* is compared     |
| unto the beasts that perish.                                          |
|                                                                       |
