| **Psalms 19. Caeli enarrant.**\                                       |
| THE heavens declare the glory of God; \* and the firmament showeth    |
| his handy-work.\                                                      |
| 2 One day telleth another; \* and one night certifieth another.\      |
| 3 There is neither speech nor language; \* but their voices are heard |
| among them.\                                                          |
| 4 Their sound is gone out into all lands; \* and their words into the |
| ends of the world.\                                                   |
| 5 In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun; \* which cometh forth |
| as a bridegroom out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a giant to run   |
| his course.\                                                          |
| 6 It goeth forth from the uttermost part of the heaven, and runneth   |
| about unto the end of it again; \* and there is nothing hid from the  |
| heat thereof.\                                                        |
| 7 The law of the LORD is an undefiled law, converting the soul; \*    |
| the testimony of the LORD is sure, and giveth wisdom unto the         |
| simple.\                                                              |
| 8 The statutes of the LORD are right, and rejoice the heart; \* the   |
| commandment of the LORD is pure, and giveth light unto the eyes.\     |
| 9 The fear of the LORD is clean, and endureth for ever; \* the        |
| judgments of the LORD are true, and righteous altogether.\            |
| 10 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold;   |
| \* sweeter also than honey, and the honeycomb.\                       |
| 11 Moreover, by them is thy servant taught; \* and in keeping of them |
| there is great reward.\                                               |
| 12 Who can tell how oft he offendeth? \* O cleanse thou me from my    |
| secret faults.\                                                       |
| 13 Keep thy servant also from presumptuous sins, lest they get the    |
| dominion over me; \* so shall I be undefiled, and innocent from the   |
| great offence.\                                                       |
| 14 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be      |
| alway acceptable in thy sight, \* O LORD, my strength and my          |
| redeemer.                                                             |
