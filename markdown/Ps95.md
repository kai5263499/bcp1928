| \                                                                     |

| **Psalm 95. Venite, exultemus.**\                                     |
| O COME, let us sing unto the LORD; \* let us heartily rejoice in the  |
| strength of our salvation.\                                           |
| 2 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving; \* and show      |
| ourselves glad in him with psalms.\                                   |
| 3 For the LORD is a great God; \* and a great King above all gods.\   |
| 4 In his hand are all the corners of the earth; \* and the strength   |
| of the hills is his also.\                                            |
| 5 The sea is his, and he made it; \* and his hands prepared the dry   |
| land.\                                                                |
| 6 O come, let us worship and fall down, \* and kneel before the LORD  |
| our Maker.\                                                           |
| 7 For he is the Lord our God; \* and we are the people of his         |
| pasture, and the sheep of his hand.\                                  |
| 8 To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts \* as in   |
| the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness;\  |
| 9 When your fathers tempted me, \* proved me, and saw my works.\      |
| 10 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, \*  |
| It is a people that do err in their hearts, for they have not known   |
| my ways:\                                                             |
| 11 Unto whom I sware in my wrath, \* that they should not enter into  |
| my rest.                                                              |
