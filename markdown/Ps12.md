| **Psalms 12. Salvum me fac.**\                                        |
| HELP me, LORD, for there is not one godly man left; \* for the        |
| faithful are minished from among the children of men.\                |
| 2 They talk of vanity every one with his neighbour; \* they do but    |
| flatter with their lips, and dissemble in their double heart.\        |
| 3 The LORD shall root out all deceitful lips, \* and the tongue that  |
| speaketh proud things;\                                               |
| 4 Which have said, With our tongue will we prevail; \* we are they    |
| that ought to speak; who is lord over us?\                            |
| 5 Now, for the comfortless troubles\' sake of the needy, \* and       |
| because of the deep sighing of the poor,\                             |
| 6 I will up, saith the LORD; \* and will help every one from him that |
| swelleth against him, and will set him at rest.\                      |
| 7 The words of the LORD are pure words; \* even as the silver which   |
| from the earth is tried, and purified seven times in the fire.\       |
| 8 Thou shalt keep them, O LORD; \* thou shalt preserve them from this |
| generation for ever.\                                                 |
| 9 The ungodly walk on every side: \* when they are exalted, the       |
| children of men are put to rebuke.                                    |
