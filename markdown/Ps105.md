| **Psalm 105. Confitemini Domino.**\                                   |
| GIVE thanks unto the LORD, and call upon his Name; \* tell the people |
| what things he hath done.\                                            |
| 2 O let your songs be of him, and praise him; \* and let your talking |
| be of all his wondrous works.\                                        |
| 3 Rejoice in his holy Name; \* let the heart of them rejoice that     |
| seek the LORD.\                                                       |
| 4 Seek the LORD and his strength; \* seek his face evermore.\         |
| 5 Remember the marvellous works that he hath done; \* his wonders,    |
| and the judgments of his mouth;\                                      |
| 6 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, \* ye children of Jacob his       |
| chosen.\                                                              |
| 7 He is the LORD our God; \* his judgments are in all the world.\     |
| 8 He hath been alway mindful of his covenant and promise, \* that he  |
| made to a thousand generations;\                                      |
| 9 Even the covenant that he made with Abraham; \* and the oath that   |
| he sware unto Isaac;\                                                 |
| 10 And appointed the same unto Jacob for a law, \* and to Israel for  |
| an everlasting testament;\                                            |
| 11 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, \* the lot of    |
| your inheritance:\                                                    |
| 12 When there were yet but a few of them, \* and they strangers in    |
| the land;\                                                            |
| 13 What time as they went from one nation to another, \* from one     |
| kingdom to another people;\                                           |
| 14 He suffered no man to do them wrong, \* but reproved even kings    |
| for their sakes;\                                                     |
| 15 Touch not mine anointed, \* and do my prophets no harm.\           |
| 16 Moreover, he called for a dearth upon the land, \* and destroyed   |
| all the provision of bread.\                                          |
| 17 But he had sent a man before them, \* even Joseph, who was sold to |
| be a bond-servant;\                                                   |
| 18 Whose feet they hurt in the stocks; \* the iron entered into his   |
| soul;\                                                                |
| 19 Until the time came that his cause was known: \* the word of the   |
| LORD tried him.\                                                      |
| 20 The king sent, and delivered him; \* the prince of the people let  |
| him go free.\                                                         |
| 21 He made him lord also of his house, \* and ruler of all his        |
| substance;\                                                           |
| 22 That he might inform his princes after his will, \* and teach his  |
| senators wisdom.\                                                     |
| 23 Israel also came into Egypt, \* and Jacob was a stranger in the    |
| land of Ham.\                                                         |
| 24 And he increased his people exceedingly, \* and made them stronger |
| than their enemies;\                                                  |
| 25 Whose heart turned so, that they hated his people, \* and dealt    |
| untruly with his servants.\                                           |
| 26 Then sent he Moses his servant, \* and Aaron whom he had chosen.\  |
| 27 And these showed his tokens among them, \* and wonders in the land |
| of Ham.\                                                              |
| 28 He sent darkness, and it was dark; \* and they were not obedient   |
| unto his word.\                                                       |
| 29 He turned their waters into blood, \* and slew their fish.\        |
| 30 Their land brought forth frogs; \* yea, even in their kings\'      |
| chambers.\                                                            |
| 31 He spake the word, and there came all manner of flies, \* and lice |
| in all their quarters.\                                               |
| 32 He gave them hailstones for rain; \* and flames of fire in their   |
| land.\                                                                |
| 33 He smote their vines also and fig-trees; \* and destroyed the      |
| trees that were in their coasts.\                                     |
| 34 He spake the word, and the grasshoppers came, and caterpillars     |
| innumerable, \* and did eat up all the grass in their land, and       |
| devoured the fruit of their ground.\                                  |
| 35 He smote all the firstborn in their land; \* even the chief of all |
| their strength.\                                                      |
| 36 He brought them forth also with silver and gold; \* there was not  |
| one feeble person among their tribes.\                                |
| 37 Egypt was glad at their departing; \* for they were afraid of      |
| them.\                                                                |
| 38 He spread out a cloud to be a covering, \* and fire to give light  |
| in the night season.\                                                 |
| 39 At their desire he brought quails; \* and he filled them with the  |
| bread of heaven.\                                                     |
| 40 He opened the rock of stone, and the waters flowed out, \* so that |
| rivers ran in the dry places.\                                        |
| 41 For why? he remembered his holy promise; \* and Abraham his        |
| servant.\                                                             |
| 42 And he brought forth his people with joy, \* and his chosen with   |
| gladness;\                                                            |
| 43 And gave them the lands of the heathen; \* and they took the       |
| labours of the people in possession;\                                 |
| 44 That they might keep his statutes, \* and observe his laws.        |
