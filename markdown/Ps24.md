| **Psalms 24. Domini est terra.**\                                     |
| THE earth is the LORD\'S, and all that therein is; \* the compass of  |
| the world, and they that dwell therein.\                              |
| 2 For he hath founded it upon the seas, \* and stablished it upon the |
| floods.\                                                              |
| 3 Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? \* or who shall rise up |
| in his holy place?\                                                   |
| 4 Even he that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; \* and that hath   |
| not lift up his mind unto vanity, nor sworn to deceive his            |
| neighbour.\                                                           |
| 5 He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, \* and righteousness   |
| from the God of his salvation.\                                       |
| 6 This is the generation of them that seek him; \* even of them that  |
| seek thy face, O God of Jacob.\                                       |
| 7 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting   |
| doors; \* and the King of glory shall come in.\                       |
| 8 Who is this King of glory? \* It is the LORD strong and mighty,     |
| even the LORD mighty in battle.\                                      |
| 9 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting   |
| doors; \* and the King of glory shall come in.\                       |
| 10 Who is this King of glory? \* Even the LORD of hosts, he is the    |
| King of glory.                                                        |
