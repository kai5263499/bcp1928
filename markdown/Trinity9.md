| 1 Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before   |
| me.\                                                                  |
| 2 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,\                     |
| 3 Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and   |
| put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I  |
| be inquired of at all by them?\                                       |
| 4 Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord   |
| GOD; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in    |
| his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his  |
| face, and cometh to the prophet; I the LORD will answer him that      |
| cometh according to the multitude of his idols;\                      |
| 5 That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because     |
| they are all estranged from me through their idols.\                  |
| 6 Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD;    |
| Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces |
| from all your abominations.\                                          |
| 7 For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that       |
| sojourneth in Israel, which separateth himself from me, and setteth   |
| up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his      |
| iniquity before his face, and cometh to a prophet to inquire of him   |
| concerning me; I the LORD will answer him by myself:\                 |
| 8 And I will set my face against that man, and will make him a sign   |
| and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people;    |
| and ye shall know that I am the LORD.\                                |
| 9 And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the   |
| LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon  |
| him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.\        |
| 10 And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the          |
| punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that |
| seeketh unto him;\                                                    |

| polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be |
| my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord GOD.\               |

| Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and   |
| to please God, so ye would abound more and more.\                     |

| forewarned you and testified.\                                        |

| also given unto us his holy Spirit.\                                  |

| so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set |
| before us,\                                                           |

| the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the      |
| shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.\       |
| 3 For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against |
| himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.\                 |
| 4 Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.\         |

| unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord,   |
| nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:\                              |

| whom he receiveth.\                                                   |

| what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?\                       |

| are ye bastards, and not sons.\                                       |

| unto the Father of spirits, and live?\                                |

| with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I   |
| have provided me a king among his sons.\                              |

| sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he        |
| sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.\     |

| outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.\               |

| 11 And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he      |
| said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the   |

| not sit down till he come hither.\                                    |
| 12 And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a |

| Arise, anoint him: for this is he.\                                   |

| shall lose his life shall preserve it.\                               |

| apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king\'s house, over      |
| against the king\'s house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in  |
| the royal house, over against the gate of the house.\                 |
| 2 And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the   |
| court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out   |
| to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew     |
| near, and touched the top of the sceptre.\                            |
| 3 Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what |
| is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the        |

| and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for     |
| him.\                                                                 |
| 5 Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as    |
| Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that      |
| Esther had prepared.\                                                 |

| petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even |
| to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.\                    |
| 7 Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is:\     |
| 8 If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please   |
| the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the     |
| king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and |
| I will do tomorrow as the king hath said.\                            |
| 9 Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but    |
| when Haman saw Mordecai in the king\'s gate, that he stood not up,    |
| nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai.\      |
| 10 Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he    |
| sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.\                |
| 11 And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude  |
| of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted     |
| him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of    |
| the king.\                                                            |
| 12 Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in  |
| with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and  |
| tomorrow am I invited unto her also with the king.\                   |
| 13 Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the    |
| Jew sitting at the king\'s gate.\                                     |
| 14 Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a      |
| gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and tomorrow speak thou unto    |
| the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily |
| with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he   |

| 13 Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I     |

| 12 And Mordecai came again to the king\'s gate. But Haman hasted to   |
| his house mourning, and having his head covered.\                     |
| 13 And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing     |

| unto him, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou    |

| pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.\                 |

| 9 Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon    |
| the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to        |
| Abraham for righteousness.\                                           |
| 10 How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in       |
| uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.\          |
| 11 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the            |
| righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that |
| he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not   |
| circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:\     |
| 12 And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the          |
| circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of    |
| our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.             |
