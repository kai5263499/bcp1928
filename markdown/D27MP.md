**Psalm 120. Ad Dominum.**\
WHEN I was in trouble, I called upon the LORD, \* and he heard me.\
2 Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, \* and from a deceitful
tongue.\
3 What reward shall be given or done unto thee, thou false tongue? \*
even mighty and sharp arrows, with hot burning coals.\
4 Woe is me, that I am constrained to dwell with Meshech, \* and to have
my habitation among the tents of Kedar!\
5 My soul hath long dwelt among them \* that are enemies unto peace.\
6 I labour for peace; but when I speak unto them thereof, \* they make
them ready to battle.\

**Psalm 121. Levavi oculos.**\
I WILL lift up mine eyes unto the hills; \* from whence cometh my help?\
2 My help cometh even from the LORD, \* who hath made heaven and earth.\
3 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved; \* and he that keepeth thee
will not sleep.\
4 Behold, he that keepeth Israel \* shall neither slumber nor sleep.\
5 The LORD himself is thy keeper; \* the LORD is thy defence upon thy
right hand;\
6 So that the sun shall not burn thee by day, \* neither the moon by
night.\
7 The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil; \* yea, it is even he that
shall keep thy soul.\
8 The LORD shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming in, \* from this
time forth for evermore.\

**Psalm 122. Laetatus sum.**\
I WAS glad when they said unto me, \* We will go into the house of the
LORD.\
2 Our feet shall stand in thy gates, \* O Jerusalem.\
3 Jerusalem is built as a city \* that is at unity in itself.\
4 For thither the tribes go up, even the tribes of the LORD, \* to
testify unto Israel, to give thanks unto the Name of the LORD.\
5 For there is the seat of judgment, \* even the seat of the house of
David.\
6 O pray for the peace of Jerusalem; \* they shall prosper that love
thee.\
7 Peace be within thy walls, \* and plenteousness within thy palaces.\
8 For my brethren and companions\' sakes, \* I will wish thee
prosperity.\
9 Yea, because of the house of the LORD our God, \* I will seek to do
thee good.\

**Psalm 123. Ad te levavi oculos meos.**\
UNTO thee lift I up mine eyes, \* O thou that dwellest in the heavens.\
2 Behold, even as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their
masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress, \*
even so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until he have mercy upon
us.\
3 Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us; \* for we are utterly
despised.\
4 Our soul is filled with the scornful reproof of the wealthy, \* and
with the despitefulness of the proud.\

**Psalm 124. Nisi quia Dominus.**\
IF the LORD himself had not been on our side, now may Israel say; \* if
the LORD himself had not been on our side, when men rose up against us;\
2 They had swallowed us up alive; \* when they were so wrathfully
displeased at us.\
3 Yea, the waters had drowned us, \* and the stream had gone over our
soul.\
4 The deep waters of the proud \* had gone even over our soul.\
5 But praised be the LORD, \* who hath not given us over for a prey unto
their teeth.\
6 Our soul is escaped even as a bird out of the snare of the fowler; \*
the snare is broken, and we are delivered.\
7 Our help standeth in the Name of the LORD, \* who hath made heaven and
earth.\

**Psalm 125. Qui confidunt.**\
THEY that put their trust in the LORD shall be even as the mount Sion,
\* which may not be removed, but standeth fast for ever.\
2 The hills stand about Jerusalem; \* even so standeth the LORD round
about his people, from this time forth for evermore.\
3 For the sceptre of the ungodly shall not abide upon the lot of the
righteous; \* lest the righteous put their hand unto wickedness.\
4 Do well, O LORD, \* unto those that are good and true of heart.\
5 As for such as turn back unto their own wickedness, \* the LORD shall
lead them forth with the evil doers; but peace shall be upon Israel.
