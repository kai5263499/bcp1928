| what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh     |
| intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.\          |

| 18 For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not      |
| worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.\  |
| 19 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the        |
| manifestation of the sons of God.\                                    |
| 20 For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by |
| reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,\                   |
| 21 Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the       |
| bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of    |
| God.\                                                                 |

| pain together until now.\                                             |
| 23 And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits  |
| of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for  |
| the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.\                    |
| 24 For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for   |
| what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?\                          |
| 25 But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait  |

| what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh     |
| intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.\          |

| 1 Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was         |
| returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode    |
| two days in Ziklag;\                                                  |
| 2 It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out |
| of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: |
| and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and  |
| did obeisance.\                                                       |
| 3 And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto  |
| him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.\                         |
| 4 And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. |
| And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many   |
| of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son |
| are dead also.\                                                       |
| 5 And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou   |
| that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?\                              |
| 6 And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon  |
| mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the        |
| chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.\                       |
| 7 And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I |
| answered, Here am I.\                                                 |
| 8 And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an      |
| Amalekite.\                                                           |
| 9 He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me:    |
| for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.\     |
| 10 So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he      |
| could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that    |
| was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have     |
| brought them hither unto my lord.\                                    |
| 11 Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise   |
| all the men that were with him:\                                      |
| 12 And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and   |
| for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the     |
| house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.\              |
| 13 And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou?  |
| And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.\           |
| 14 And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth |
| thine hand to destroy the LORD\'S anointed?\                          |
| 15 And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall |
| upon him. And he smote him that he died.\                             |
| 16 And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth |

| 1 Brethren, my heart\'s desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that  |
| they might be saved.\                                                 |
| 2 For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not        |
| according to knowledge.\                                              |
| 3 For they being ignorant of God\'s righteousness, and going about to |
| establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto |
| the righteousness of God.\                                            |
| 4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one     |
| that believeth.\                                                      |
| 5 For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That    |
| the man which doeth those things shall live by them.\                 |
| 6 But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say  |
| not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring  |
| Christ down from above:)\                                             |
| 7 Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ   |
| again from the dead.)\                                                |
| 8 But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in |
| thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;\              |
| 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt |
| believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou   |
| shalt be saved.\                                                      |
| 10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the  |
| mouth confession is made unto salvation.\                             |
| 11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be   |
| ashamed.\                                                             |
| 12 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the  |
| same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.\              |
| []{#anchor337784}13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the     |
| Lord shall be saved.\                                                 |
| 14 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?    |
| and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and    |
| how shall they hear without a preacher?\                              |
| 15 And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written,  |
| How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace,   |
| and bring glad tidings of good things!\                               |
| 16 But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord,   |
| who hath believed our report?\                                        |
| 17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.\  |
| 18 But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into  |
| all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.\           |
| 19 But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke  |
| you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I |
| will anger you.\                                                      |
| 20 But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that       |
| sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after     |
| me.\                                                                  |

| thinking, David cannot come in hither.\                               |

| his ear, and healed him.\                                             |

| against a thief, with swords and staves?\                             |

| 11 I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid:  |
| but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles,    |
| for to provoke them to jealousy.\                                     |

| fulness?\                                                             |

| Gentiles, I magnify mine office:\                                     |

| flesh, and might save some of them.\                                  |
| 15 For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world,   |
| what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?\         |
| 16 For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the   |
| root be holy, so are the branches.\                                   |
| 17 And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild  |
| olive tree, wert grafted in among them, and with them partakest of    |
| the root and fatness of the olive tree;\                              |
| 18 Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest    |
| not the root, but the root thee.\                                     |
| 19 Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be  |
| grafted in.\                                                          |

| by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:\                               |

| Habakkuk 3:2-6, 10-13, 18-19a**\                                      |
| 2 O LORD, I have heard thy speech, and was afraid: O LORD, revive thy |
| work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; |
| in wrath remember mercy.\                                             |
| 3 God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His  |
| glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.\     |
| 4 And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out of his |
| hand: and there was the hiding of his power.\                         |
| 5 Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his |
| feet.\                                                                |
| 6 He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the  |
| nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual  |
| hills did bow: his ways are everlasting.\                             |
| 10 The mountains saw thee, and they trembled: the overflowing of the  |
| water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, and lifted up his hands  |
| on high.\                                                             |
| 11 The sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of  |
| thine arrows they went, and at the shining of thy glittering spear.\  |
| 12 Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst       |
| thresh the heathen in anger.\                                         |
| 13 Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for       |
| salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the     |
| house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck.     |
| Selah.\                                                               |

| Romans 11:22-36**\                                                    |
| 22 Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which   |
| fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his    |
| goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.\                      |
| 23 And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be       |
| grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.\                  |
| 24 For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by        |
| nature, and wert grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree:   |
| how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be grafted  |
| into their own olive tree?\                                           |
| 25 For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this      |
| mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness  |
| in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be   |
| come in.\                                                             |
| 26 And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall    |
| come out of Zion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from  |
| Jacob:\                                                               |
| 27 For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their    |
| sins.\                                                                |
| 28 As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as  |
| touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers\' sakes.\     |
| 29 For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.\          |
| 30 For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now        |
| obtained mercy through their unbelief:\                               |
| 31 Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy  |
| they also may obtain mercy.\                                          |
| []{#anchor396003}32 For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that |
| he might have mercy upon all.\                                        |
| 33 O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! |
| how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!\   |
| 34 For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his      |
| counsellor?\                                                          |
| 35 Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto   |
| him again?\                                                           |
