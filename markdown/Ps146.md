| **Psalm 146. Lauda, anima mea.**\                                     |
| PRAISE the LORD, O my soul: while I live, will I praise the LORD; \*  |
| yea, as long as I have any being, I will sing praises unto my God.\   |
| 2 O put not your trust in princes, nor in any child of man; \* for    |
| there is no help in them.\                                            |
| 3 For when the breath of man goeth forth, he shall turn again to his  |
| earth, \* and then all his thoughts perish.\                          |
| 4 Blessed is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, \* and whose |
| hope is in the LORD his God:\                                         |
| 5 Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that therein is; \* who |
| keepeth his promise for ever;\                                        |
| 6 Who helpeth them to right that suffer wrong; \* who feedeth the     |
| hungry.\                                                              |
| 7 The LORD looseth men out of prison; \* the LORD giveth sight to the |
| blind.\                                                               |
| 8 The LORD helpeth them that are fallen; \* the LORD careth for the   |
| righteous.\                                                           |
| 9 The LORD careth for the strangers; he defendeth the fatherless and  |
| widow: \* as for the way of the ungodly, he turneth it upside down.\  |
| 10 The LORD thy God, O Sion, shall be King for evermore, \* and       |
| throughout all generations.                                           |
