| **Psalms 27. Dominus illuminatio.**\                                  |
| THE LORD is my light and my salvation; whom then shall I fear? \* the |
| LORD is the strength of my life; of whom then shall I be afraid?\     |
| 2 When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat |
| up my flesh, \* they stumbled and fell.\                              |
| 3 Though an host of men were laid against me, yet shall not my heart  |
| be afraid; \* and though there rose up war against me, yet will I put |
| my trust in him.\                                                     |
| 4 One thing have I desired of the LORD, which I will require; \* even |
| that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to |
| behold the fair beauty of the LORD, and to visit his temple.\         |
| 5 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his tabernacle; \*   |
| yea, in the secret place of his dwelling shall he hide me, and set me |
| up upon a rock of stone.\                                             |
| 6 And now shall he lift up mine head \* above mine enemies round      |
| about me.\                                                            |
| 7 Therefore will I offer in his dwelling an oblation, with great      |
| gladness: \* I will sing and speak praises unto the LORD.\            |
| 8 Hearken unto my voice, O LORD, when I cry unto thee; \* have mercy  |
| upon me, and hear me.\                                                |
| 9 My heart hath talked of thee, Seek ye my face: \* Thy face, LORD,   |
| will I seek.\                                                         |
| 10 O hide not thou thy face from me, \* nor cast thy servant away in  |
| displeasure.\                                                         |
| 11 Thou hast been my succour; \* leave me not, neither forsake me, O  |
| God of my salvation.\                                                 |
| 12 When my father and my mother forsake me, \* the LORD taketh me     |
| up.\                                                                  |
| 13 Teach me thy way, O LORD, \* and lead me in the right way, because |
| of mine enemies.\                                                     |
| 14 Deliver me not over into the will of mine adversaries: \* for      |
| there are false witnesses risen up against me, and such as speak      |
| wrong.\                                                               |
| 15 I should utterly have fainted, \* but that I believe verily to see |
| the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.\                  |
| 16 O tarry thou the LORD\'S leisure; \* be strong, and he shall       |
| comfort thine heart; and put thou thy trust in the LORD.              |
