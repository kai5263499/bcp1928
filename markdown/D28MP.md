**Psalm 132. Memento, Domine.\
**LORD, remember David, \* and all his trouble:\
2 How he sware unto the LORD, \* and vowed a vow unto the Almighty God
of Jacob:\
3 I will not come within the tabernacle of mine house, \* nor climb up
into my bed;\
4 I will not suffer mine eyes to sleep, nor mine eyelids to slumber; \*
neither the temples of my head to take any rest;\
5 Until I find out a place for the temple of the LORD; \* an habitation
for the Mighty God of Jacob.\
6 Lo, we heard of the same at Ephratah, \* and found it in the wood.\
7 We will go into his tabernacle, \* and fall low on our knees before
his footstool.\
8 Arise, O LORD, into thy resting-place; \* thou, and the ark of thy
strength.\
9 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; \* and let thy saints
sing with joyfulness.\
10 For thy servant David\'s sake, \* turn not away the face of thine
anointed.\
11 The LORD hath made a faithful oath unto David, \* and he shall not
shrink from it:\
12 Of the fruit of thy body \* shall I set upon thy throne.\
13 If thy children will keep my covenant, and my testimonies that I
shall teach them; \* their children also shall sit upon thy throne for
evermore.\
14 For the LORD hath chosen Sion to be an habitation for himself; \* he
hath longed for her.\
15 This shall be my rest for ever: \* here will I dwell, for I have a
delight therein.\
16 I will bless her victuals with increase, \* and will satisfy her poor
with bread.\
17 I will deck her priests with health, \* and her saints shall rejoice
and sing.\
18 There shall I make the horn of David to flourish: \* I have ordained
a lantern for mine anointed.\
19 As for his enemies, I shall clothe them with shame; \* but upon
himself shall his crown flourish.\

**Psalm 133. Ecce, quam bonum!**\
BEHOLD, how good and joyful a thing it is, \* for brethren to dwell
together in unity!\
2 It is like the precious oil upon the head, that ran down unto the
beard, \* even unto Aaron\'s beard, and went down to the skirts of his
clothing.\
3 Like as the dew of Hermon, \* which fell upon the hill of Sion.\
4 For there the LORD promised his blessing, \* and life for evermore.\

**Psalm 134. Ecce nunc.**\
BEHOLD now, praise the LORD, \* all ye servants of the LORD;\
2 Ye that by night stand in the house of the LORD, \* even in the courts
of the house of our God.\
3 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, \* and praise the LORD.\
4 The LORD that made heaven and earth \* give thee blessing out of
Sion.\

**Psalm 135. Laudate Nomen.**\
O PRAISE the LORD, laud ye the Name of the LORD; \* praise it, O ye
servants of the LORD;\
2 Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, \* in the courts of the house
of our God.\
3 O praise the LORD, for the LORD is gracious; \* O sing praises unto
his Name, for it is lovely.\
4 For why? the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, \* and Israel for
his own possession.\
5 For I know that the LORD is great, \* and that our Lord is above all
gods.\
6 Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth; \*
and in the sea, and in all deep places.\
7 He bringeth forth the clouds from the ends of the world, \* and
sendeth forth lightnings with the rain, bringing the winds out of his
treasuries.\
8 He smote the firstborn of Egypt, \* both of man and beast.\
9 He hath sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O thou land of
Egypt; \* upon Pharaoh, and all his servants.\
10 He smote divers nations, \* and slew mighty kings:\
11 Sihon, king of the Amorites; and Og, the king of Bashan; \* and all
the kingdoms of Canaan;\
12 And gave their land to be an heritage, \* even an heritage unto
Israel his people.\
13 Thy Name, O LORD, endureth for ever; \* so doth thy memorial, O LORD,
from one generation to another.\
14 For the LORD will avenge his people, \* and be gracious unto his
servants.\
15 As for the images of the heathen, they are but silver and gold; \*
the work of men\'s hands.\
16 They have mouths, and speak not; \* eyes have they, but they see
not.\
17 They have ears, and yet they hear not; \* neither is there any breath
in their mouths.\
18 They that make them are like unto them; \* and so are all they that
put their trust in them.\
19 Praise the LORD, ye house of Israel; \* praise the LORD, ye house of
Aaron.\
20 Praise the LORD, ye house of Levi; \* ye that fear the LORD, praise
the LORD.\
21 Praised be the LORD out of Sion, \* who dwelleth at Jerusalem.\
