**Psalm 75. Confitebimur tibi.**\
UNTO thee, O God, do we give thanks; \* yea, unto thee do we give
thanks.\
2 Thy Name also is so nigh; \* and that do thy wondrous works declare.\
3 In the appointed time, saith God, \* I shall judge according unto
right.\
4 The earth is weak, and all the inhabiters thereof: \* I bear up the
pillars of it.\
5 I said unto the fools, Deal not so madly; \* and to the ungodly, Set
not up your horn.\
6 Set not up your horn on high, \* and speak not with a stiff neck.\
7 For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, \* nor
yet from the south.\
8 And why? God is the Judge; \* he putteth down one, and setteth up
another.\
9 For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; \* it
is full mixt, and he poureth out of the same.\
10 As for the dregs thereof, \* all the ungodly of the earth shall drink
them, and suck them out.\
11 But I will talk of the God of Jacob, \* and praise him for ever.\
12 All the horns of the ungodly also will I break, \* and the horns of
the righteous shall be exalted.\

**Psalm 76. Notus in Judaea.**\
IN Judah is God known; \* his Name is great in Israel.\
2 At Salem is his tabernacle, \* and his dwelling in Sion.\
3 There brake he the arrows of the bow, \* the shield, the sword, and
the battle.\
4 Thou art glorious in might, \* when thou comest from the hills of the
robbers.\
5 The proud are robbed, they have slept their sleep; \* and all the men
whose hands were mighty have found nothing.\
6 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, \* both the chariot and horse are
fallen.\
7 Thou, even thou art to be feared; \* and who may stand in thy sight
when thou art angry?\
8 Thou didst cause thy judgment to be heard from heaven; \* the earth
trembled, and was still,\
9 When God arose to judgment, \* and to help all the meek upon earth.\
10 The fierceness of man shall turn to thy praise; \* and the fierceness
of them shalt thou refrain.\
11 Promise unto the LORD your God, and keep it, all ye that are round
about him; \* bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.\
12 He shall refrain the spirit of princes, \* and is wonderful among the
kings of the earth.

**Psalm 77. Voce mea ad Dominum.**\
I WILL cry unto God with my voice; \* even unto God will I cry with my
voice, and he shall hearken unto me.\
2 In the time of my trouble I sought the Lord: \* I stretched forth my
hands unto him, and ceased not in the night season; my soul refused
comfort.\
3 When I am in heaviness, I will think upon God; \* when my heart is
vexed, I will complain.\
4 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: \* I am so feeble that I cannot speak.\
5 I have considered the days of old, \* and the years that are past.\
6 I call to remembrance my song, \* and in the night I commune with mine
own heart, and search out my spirit.\
7 Will the Lord absent himself for ever? \* and will he be no more
intreated?\
8 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? \* and is his promise come utterly
to an end for evermore?\
9 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? \* and will he shut up his
loving-kindness in displeasure?\
10 And I said, It is mine own infirmity; \* but I will remember the
years of the right hand of the Most Highest.\
11 I will remember the works of the LORD, \* and call to mind thy
wonders of old time.\
12 I will think also of all thy works, \* and my talking shall be of thy
doings.\
13 Thy way, O God, is holy: \* who is so great a God as our God?\
14 Thou art the God that doest wonders, \* and hast declared thy power
among the peoples.\
15 Thou hast mightily delivered thy people, \* even the sons of Jacob
and Joseph.\
16 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee, and were afraid; \*
the depths also were troubled.\
17 The clouds poured out water, the air thundered, \* and thine arrows
went abroad.\
18 The voice of thy thunder was heard round about: \* the lightnings
shone upon the ground; the earth was moved, and shook withal.\
19 Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in the great waters, \* and thy
footsteps are not known.\
20 Thou leddest thy people like sheep, \* by the hand of Moses and
Aaron.
