| 1 Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show my |
| people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.\       |
| 2 Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation    |
| that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God:   |
| they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in        |
| approaching to God.\                                                  |
| 3 Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore   |
| have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in  |
| the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours.\   |
| 4 Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist   |
| of wickedness: ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to make your      |
| voice to be heard on high.\                                           |
| []{#anchor91986}5 Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a   |
| man to afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and |
| to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast,  |
| and an acceptable day to the LORD?\                                   |
| []{#anchor92431}6 Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose   |
| the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the    |
| oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?\                     |
| 7 Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the  |
| poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that  |
| thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?\ |
| 8 Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health   |
| shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before    |
| thee; the glory of the LORD shall be thy rearward.\                   |
| 9 Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt cry,    |
| and he shall say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee |
| the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity;\      |
| 10 And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the       |
| afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy       |
| darkness be as the noonday:\                                          |
| 11 And the LORD shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in |
| drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered     |
| garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.\           |
| 12 And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places:   |
| thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou     |
| shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to |
| dwell in.\                                                            |
| 13 If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy        |
| pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of  |
| the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, |
| nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words:\        |
| 14 Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee |
| to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the     |

| 1 Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them:  |
| otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.\       |
| 2 Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before |
| thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that |
| they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their    |
| reward.\                                                              |
| 3 But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right |
| hand doeth:\                                                          |
| []{#anchor98525}4 That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father    |
| which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.\              |
| 5 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for |
| they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of    |
| the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you,     |
| They have their reward.\                                              |
| 6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou   |
| hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy    |
| Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.\               |
| 7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for  |
| they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.\         |
| 8 Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what    |
| things ye have need of, before ye ask him.\                           |
| 9 After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in        |
| heaven, Hallowed be thy name.\                                        |
| 10 Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.\  |
| 11 Give us this day our daily bread.\                                 |

| 13 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For     |
| thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.\  |
| 14 For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will  |
| also forgive you:\                                                    |
| 15 But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your      |
| Father forgive your trespasses.\                                      |
| []{#anchor101736}16 Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, |
| of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may   |
| appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their       |
| reward.\                                                              |

| 18 That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which   |
| is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward     |

| arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.\              |
| 11 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of |
| water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to  |
| draw water.\                                                          |
| 12 And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me |
| good speed this day, and show kindness unto my master Abraham.\       |
| 13 Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of    |
| the men of the city come out to draw water:\                          |
| 14 And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let  |
| down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say,   |
| Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she     |
| that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I   |
| know that thou hast shown kindness unto my master.\                   |
| 15 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold,    |
| Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of |
| Nahor, Abraham\'s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.\       |
| 16 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had   |
| any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her      |
| pitcher, and came up.\                                                |
| 17 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee,    |
| drink a little water of thy pitcher.\                                 |
| 18 And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her     |
| pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.\                           |
| 19 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw      |
| water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.\            |
| 20 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran   |
| again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.\      |
| 21 And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the    |
| LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.\                         |
| 22 And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man |
| took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for  |
| her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;\                             |
| 23 And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there  |
| room in thy father\'s house for us to lodge in?\                      |
| 24 And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of     |
| Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.\                                   |
| 25 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender       |
| enough, and room to lodge in.\                                        |
| 26 And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.\         |
| 27 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who     |
| hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being |
| in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master\'s brethren.\   |

| or his parents, that he was born blind?\                              |
| 3 Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but  |
| that the works of God should be made manifest in him.\                |
| 4 I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the     |
| night cometh, when no man can work.\                                  |
| 5 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.\         |
| 6 When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of    |
| the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the       |
| clay,\                                                                |
| 7 And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by     |
| interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and     |
| came seeing.\                                                         |
| 8 The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that   |

| 9 Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I  |
| am he.\                                                               |
| 10 Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?\         |
| 11 He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and    |
| anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and   |
| wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.\                   |
| 12 Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.\        |
| 13 They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.\       |
| 14 And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened    |
| his eyes.\                                                            |
| 15 Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his    |
| sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed,   |
| and do see.\                                                          |
| 16 Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God,      |
| because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man    |
| that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among     |

| 17 They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that   |
| he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.\                 |
| 18 But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been      |
| blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him   |
| that had received his sight.\                                         |

| blind? how then doth he now see?\                                     |
| 20 His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son,  |
| and that he was born blind:\                                          |

| 18 Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be     |
| wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.\      |
| 19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is    |
| written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.\                 |
| 20 And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they    |
| are vain.\                                                            |
| 21 Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;\      |
| 22 Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or     |
| death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;\          |
| 23 And ye are Christ\'s; and Christ is God\'s.\                       |
| 1 Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and      |
| stewards of the mysteries of God.\                                    |
| 2 Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.\ |
| []{#anchor203549}3 But with me it is a very small thing that I should |
| be judged of you, or of man\'s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own    |
| self.\                                                                |

| that judgeth me is the Lord.\                                         |
| 5 Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who   |
| both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make |
| manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have    |
| praise of God.\                                                       |

| commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: |

| his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his |
| blood will I require at thine hand.\                                  |
| 21 Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous    |
| sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is     |
| warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.\                           |

| 9 Therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;\              |

| feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any    |
| more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not |

| my sheep, and seek them out.\                                         |
| 12 As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among    |
| his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will   |
| deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the  |
| cloudy and dark day.\                                                 |
| 13 And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from    |
| the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them   |
| upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited  |
| places of the country.\                                               |
| 14 I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of |
| Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold, and  |
| in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.\       |
| 15 I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the |
| Lord GOD.\                                                            |
| 16 I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was    |
| driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will         |
| strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the    |
