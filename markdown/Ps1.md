| **Psalms 1. Beatus vir qui non abiit.**\                              |
| BLESSED is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the         |
| ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, \* and hath not sat in the  |
| seat of the scornful.\                                                |
| 2 But his delight is in the law of the LORD; \* and in his law will   |
| he exercise himself day and night.\                                   |
| 3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the water-side, \* that will |
| bring forth his fruit in due season.\                                 |
| 4 His leaf also shall not wither; \* and look, whatsoever he doeth,   |
| it shall prosper.\                                                    |
| 5 As for the ungodly, it is not so with them; \* but they are like    |
| the chaff, which the wind scattereth away from the face of the        |
| earth.\                                                               |
| 6 Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stand in the judgment,   |
| \* neither the sinners in the congregation of the righteous.\         |
| 7 But the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous; \* and the way of    |
| the ungodly shall perish.                                             |
