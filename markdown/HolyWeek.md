| **[]{#anchor1281869}17 For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to      |

| 18 For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; |
| but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.\                  |
| 19 For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will |
| bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.\                   |

| after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:\        |

| miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old,     |
| when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help    |
| her: the adversaries saw her, and did mock at her sabbaths.\          |
| 8 Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all     |
| that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness:  |
| yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.\                              |
| 9 Her filthiness is in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end;  |
| therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter. O LORD,    |
| behold my affliction: for the enemy hath magnified himself.\          |
| 10 The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant       |
| things: for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her           |
| sanctuary, whom thou didst command that they should not enter into    |
| thy congregation.\                                                    |
| 11 All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their        |
| pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O LORD, and        |
| consider; for I am become vile.\                                      |
| 12 Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if      |
| there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me,       |
| wherewith the LORD hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.\ |

| Father: for my Father is greater than I.\                             |

| while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.\              |
| 17 Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this     |
| that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and   |
| again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the  |
| Father?\                                                              |

| no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.\      |
| 22 And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and    |
| your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.\       |

| I will pray the Father for you:\                                      |
| 27 For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and   |
| have believed that I came out from God.\                              |

| may believe that I am he.\                                            |
| 20 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I     |
| send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent   |
| me.\                                                                  |
| 21 When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and           |
| testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you  |
| shall betray me.\                                                     |
| 22 Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he      |
| spake.\                                                               |
| 23 Now there was leaning on Jesus\' bosom one of his disciples, whom  |
| Jesus loved.\                                                         |
| 24 Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it   |
| should be of whom he spake.\                                          |
| 25 He then lying on Jesus\' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?\  |
| []{#anchor1597697}26 Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a |
| sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave   |
| it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.\                              |
| 27 And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto     |
| him, That thou doest, do quickly.\                                    |
| 28 Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto    |
| him.\                                                                 |
| 29 For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus    |
| had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the  |
| feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.\                |
| 30 He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was   |
| night.\                                                               |
| 31 Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man |
| glorified, and God is glorified in him.\                              |
| 32 If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, |
| and shall straightway glorify him.\                                   |
| 33 Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek   |
| me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now |
| I say to you.\                                                        |
| 34 A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I  |
| have loved you, that ye also love one another.\                       |
| 35 By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have    |
| love one to another.\                                                 |
| 36 Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus         |
| answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou    |
| shalt follow me afterwards.\                                          |
| 37 Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will    |
| lay down my life for thy sake.\                                       |
| 38 Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake?       |
| Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou   |
| hast denied me thrice.\                                               |

| 1 These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and      |
| said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also    |
| may glorify thee:\                                                    |

| eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.\                      |
| 3 And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true   |
| God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.\                          |

| thou gavest me to do.\                                                |
| 5 And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the     |
| glory which I had with thee before the world was.\                    |
| 6 I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of |
| the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have    |
| kept thy word.\                                                       |

| and they have believed that thou didst send me.\                      |
| 9 I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou  |
| hast given me; for they are thine.\                                   |

| I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom   |
| thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.\                 |
| 12 While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those |
| that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the    |
| son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.\             |
| 13 And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world,     |
| that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.\                 |
| 14 I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because |
| they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.\            |
| 15 I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but     |
| that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.\                         |
| 16 They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.\         |
| 17 Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.\               |

| sanctified through the truth.\                                        |

| 5 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass;    |
| and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.\ |
| 6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon   |
| Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and     |
| they went both of them together.\                                     |

| thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou     |
| hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.\                   |

| 1 When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples |
| over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, |
| and his disciples.\                                                   |
| 2 And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus       |
| ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.\                        |
| 3 Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the     |
| chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches |
| and weapons.\                                                         |
| 4 Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went |
| forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?\                             |
| 5 They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am   |
| he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.\             |
| 6 As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, |
| and fell to the ground.\                                              |
| 7 Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of     |
| Nazareth.\                                                            |
| 8 Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek  |
| me, let these go their way:\                                          |
| 9 That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which   |
| thou gavest me have I lost none.\                                     |
| 10 Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high        |
| priest\'s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant\'s name was |
| Malchus.\                                                             |
| 11 Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the  |
| cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?\             |
| 12 Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, |
| and bound him,\                                                       |
| 13 And led him away to Annas first; for he was father-in-law to       |
| Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.\                  |
| 14 Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was   |
| expedient that one man should die for the people.\                    |
| 15 And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that  |
| disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into  |
| the palace of the high priest.\                                       |
| 16 But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other      |
| disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her    |
| that kept the door, and brought in Peter.\                            |
| 17 Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou  |
| also one of this man\'s disciples? He saith, I am not.\               |
| 18 And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of  |
| coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood   |
| with them, and warmed himself.\                                       |
| 19 The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his      |
| doctrine.\                                                            |
| 20 Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in  |
| the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and |
| in secret have I said nothing.\                                       |
| 21 Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto |
| them: behold, they know what I said.\                                 |
| 22 And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by    |
| struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the    |
| high priest so?\                                                      |
| 23 Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the     |
| evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?\                              |
| 24 Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.\       |
| 25 And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto |
| him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said,  |
| I am not.\                                                            |
| 26 One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose    |
| ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?\ |
| 27 Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.\           |
| 28 Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and   |
| it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall,    |
| lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.\   |
| 29 Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye |
| against this man?\                                                    |
| 30 They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we   |
| would not have delivered him up unto thee.\                           |
| 31 Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according   |
| to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for   |
| us to put any man to death:\                                          |
| 32 That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake,       |
| signifying what death he should die.\                                 |
| 33 Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called       |
| Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?\             |
| 34 Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did      |
| others tell it thee of me?\                                           |
| 35 Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief        |
| priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?\            |
| 36 Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom     |
| were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not   |
| be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.\      |
| 37 Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus        |
| answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and   |
| for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto |
| the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.\          |
| 38 Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this,   |
| he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him   |
| no fault at all.\                                                     |
| 39 But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the    |
| passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the   |
| Jews?\                                                                |
| 40 Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now |
| Barabbas was a robber.\                                               |

| 13 Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and   |
| extolled, and be very high.\                                          |
| 14 As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more than  |
| any man, and his form more than the sons of men:\                     |
| 15 So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their      |
| mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see;  |
| and that which they had not heard shall they consider.\               |
| 1 Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD    |
| revealed?\                                                            |
| 2 For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root    |
| out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we      |
| shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.\         |
| 3 He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and           |
| acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he   |
| was despised, and we esteemed him not.\                               |
| 4 Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we    |
| did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.\              |
| 5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our   |
| iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his  |
| stripes we are healed.\                                               |
| 6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his |
| own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.\       |
| 7 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his       |
| mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep       |
| before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.\            |
| 8 He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare   |
| his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for |
| the transgression of my people was he stricken.\                      |
| 9 And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his     |
| death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his |
| mouth.\                                                               |
| 10 Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief:   |
| when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his   |
| seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall   |
| prosper in his hand.\                                                 |
| 11 He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied:   |
| by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he      |
| shall bear their iniquities.\                                         |
| 12 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall |
| divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul |
| unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare   |
| the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.\        |

| 38 And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus,    |
| but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take |
| away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, |

| with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.\               |

| the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.\          |
