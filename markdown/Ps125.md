| **Psalm 125. Qui confidunt.**\                                        |
| THEY that put their trust in the LORD shall be even as the mount      |
| Sion, \* which may not be removed, but standeth fast for ever.\       |
| 2 The hills stand about Jerusalem; \* even so standeth the LORD round |
| about his people, from this time forth for evermore.\                 |
| 3 For the sceptre of the ungodly shall not abide upon the lot of the  |
| righteous; \* lest the righteous put their hand unto wickedness.\     |
| 4 Do well, O LORD, \* unto those that are good and true of heart.\    |
| 5 As for such as turn back unto their own wickedness, \* the LORD     |
| shall lead them forth with the evil doers; but peace shall be upon    |
| Israel.                                                               |
