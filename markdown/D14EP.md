**Psalm 73. Quam bonus Israel!**\
TRULY God is loving unto Israel: \* even unto such as are of a clean
heart.\
2 Nevertheless, my feet were almost gone, \* my treadings had well-nigh
slipt.\
3 And why? I was grieved at the wicked: \* I do also see the ungodly in
such prosperity.\
4 For they are in no peril of death; \* but are lusty and strong.\
5 They come in no misfortune like other folk; \* neither are they
plagued like other men.\
6 And this is the cause that they are so holden with pride, \* and
cruelty covereth them as a garment.\
7 Their eyes swell with fatness, \* and they do even what they lust.\
8 They corrupt other, and speak of wicked blasphemy; \* their talking is
against the Most High.\
9 For they stretch forth their mouth unto the heaven, \* and their
tongue goeth through the world.\
10 Therefore fall the people unto them, \* and thereout suck they no
small advantage.\
11 Tush, say they, how should God perceive it? \* is there knowledge in
the Most High?\
12 Lo, these are the ungodly, \* these prosper in the world, and these
have riches in possession:\
13 And I said, Then have I cleansed my heart in vain, \* and washed my
hands in innocency.\
14 All the day long have I been punished, \* and chastened every
morning.\
15 Yea, and I had almost said even as they; \* but lo, then I should
have condemned the generation of thy children.\
16 Then thought I to understand this; \* but it was too hard for me,\
17 Until I went into the sanctuary of God: \* then understood I the end
of these men;\
18 Namely, how thou dost set them in slippery places, \* and castest
them down, and destroyest them.\
19 O how suddenly do they consume, \* perish, and come to a fearful
end!\
20 Yea, even like as a dream when one awaketh; \* so shalt thou make
their image to vanish out of the city.\
21 Thus my heart was grieved, \* and it went even through my reins.\
22 So foolish was I, and ignorant, \* even as it were a beast before
thee.\
23 Nevertheless, I am alway by thee; \* for thou hast holden me by my
right hand.\
24 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, \* and after that receive me
with glory.\
25 Whom have I in heaven but thee? \* and there is none upon earth that
I desire in comparison of thee.\
26 My flesh and my heart faileth; \* but God is the strength of my
heart, and my portion for ever.\
27 For lo, they that forsake thee shall perish; \* thou hast destroyed
all them that are unfaithful unto thee.\
28 But it is good for me to hold me fast by God, to put my trust in the
Lord GOD, \* and to speak of all thy works in the gates of the daughter
of Sion.\

**Psalm 74. Ut quid, Deus?**\
O GOD, wherefore art thou absent from us so long? \* why is thy wrath so
hot against the sheep of thy pasture?\
2 O think upon thy congregation, \* whom thou hast purchased, and
redeemed of old.\
3 Think upon the tribe of thine inheritance, \* and Mount Sion, wherein
thou hast dwelt.\
4 Lift up thy feet, that thou mayest utterly destroy every enemy, \*
which hath done evil in thy sanctuary.\
5 Thine adversaries roar in the midst of thy congregations, \* and set
up their banners for tokens.\
6 He that hewed timber afore out of the thick trees, \* was known to
bring it to an excellent work.\
7 But now they break down all the carved work thereof \* with axes and
hammers.\
8 They have set fire upon thy holy places, \* and have defiled the
dwelling-place of thy Name, even unto the ground.\
9 Yea, they said in their hearts, Let us make havoc of them altogether:
\* thus have they burnt up all the houses of God in the land.\
10 We see not our tokens; there is not one prophet more; \* no, not one
is there among us, that understandeth any more.\
11 O God, how long shall the adversary do this dishonour? \* shall the
enemy blaspheme thy Name for ever?\
12 Why withdrawest thou thy hand? \* why pluckest thou not thy right
hand out of thy bosom to consume the enemy?\
13 For God is my King of old; \* the help that is done upon earth, he
doeth it himself.\
14 Thou didst divide the sea through thy power; \* thou brakest the
heads of the dragons in the waters.\
15 Thou smotest the heads of leviathan in pieces, \* and gavest him to
be meat for the people of the wilderness.\
16 Thou broughtest out fountains and waters out of the hard rocks; \*
thou driedst up mighty waters.\
17 The day is thine, and the night is thine; \* thou hast prepared the
light and the sun.\
18 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth; \* thou hast made summer
and winter.\
19 Remember this, O LORD, how the enemy hath rebuked; \* and how the
foolish people hath blasphemed thy Name.\
20 O deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the multitude of the
enemies; \* and forget not the congregation of the poor for ever.\
21 Look upon the covenant; \* for all the earth is full of darkness and
cruel habitations.\
22 O let not the simple go away ashamed; \* but let the poor and needy
give praise unto thy Name.\
23 Arise, O God, maintain thine own cause; \* remember how the foolish
man blasphemeth thee daily.\
24 Forget not the voice of thine enemies: \* the presumption of them
that hate thee increaseth ever more and more.
