| 11 To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith |
| the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of    |
| fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs,  |
| or of he goats.\                                                      |

| 15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an  |

| 1 For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the     |
| very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they  |
| offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.\  |
| 2 For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the |
| worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.\  |
| 3 But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins   |
| every year.\                                                          |

| take away sins.\                                                      |

| 6 In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no          |
| pleasure.\                                                            |

| me,) to do thy will, O God.\                                          |
| 8 Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and  |
| offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein;   |
| which are offered by the law;\                                        |
| 9 Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the  |
| first, that he may establish the second.\                             |
| 10 By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the    |
| body of Jesus Christ once for all.\                                   |
| 11 And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering           |
| oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:\      |
| 12 But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for      |
| ever, sat down on the right hand of God;\                             |
| 13 From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.\ |
| 14 For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are       |
| sanctified.\                                                          |
| 15 Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he  |
| had said before,\                                                     |
| 16 This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days,  |
| saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their    |
| minds will I write them;\                                             |
| 17 And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.\            |
| 18 Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for     |
| sin.\                                                                 |

| the veil, that is to say, his flesh;\                                 |

| saith the LORD; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king  |
| of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full  |
| years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.\                        |
| 12 Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the prophet, after    |
| that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of    |
| the prophet Jeremiah, saying,\                                        |
| 13 Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast       |

| 14 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a  |
| yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve  |
| Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have  |
| given him the beasts of the field also.\                              |
| 15 Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear     |
| now, Hananiah; The LORD hath not sent thee; but thou makest this      |
| people to trust in a lie.\                                            |

| 29 And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the       |
| firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that    |
| sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the   |
| dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.\                            |
| 30 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and    |
| all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was  |
| not a house where there was not one dead.\                            |
| 31 And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and |
| get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of       |
| Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.\                     |
| 32 Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be      |
| gone; and bless me also.\                                             |
| 33 And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might     |
| send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead     |
| men.\                                                                 |

| kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their            |
| shoulders.\                                                           |

| they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold,  |
| and raiment:\                                                         |
| 36 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, |
| so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they    |
| spoiled the Egyptians.\                                               |
| 37 And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth,      |
| about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.\   |
| 38 And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and      |
| herds, even very much cattle.\                                        |
| 39 And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought    |
| forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust |
| out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for      |
| themselves any victual.\                                              |
| 42 It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them  |
| out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be      |
| observed of all the children of Israel in their generations.\         |

| 1 Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour |

| having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the  |
| end.\                                                                 |

| Judas Iscariot, Simon\'s son, to betray him;\                         |
| 3 Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands,  |
| and that he was come from God, and went to God;\                      |
| 4 He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a      |
| towel, and girded himself.\                                           |

| disciples\' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was    |
| girded.\                                                              |

| thou wash my feet?\                                                   |

| but thou shalt know hereafter.\                                       |
| 8 Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered |
| him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.\                  |
| 9 Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my     |
| hands and my head.\                                                   |
| 10 Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his |
| feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.\        |
| 11 For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not   |
| all clean.\                                                           |
| 12 So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and |
| was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to    |
| you?\                                                                 |
| 13 Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.\         |
| 14 If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also    |
| ought to wash one another\'s feet.\                                   |
| 15 For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done  |
| to you.\                                                              |
