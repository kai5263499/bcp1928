| And she said, The head of John the Baptist.\                          |

| because I was naked; and I hid myself.\                               |
| 11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten   |
| of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?\   |
| 12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she    |
| gave me of the tree, and I did eat.\                                  |
| 13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast  |
| done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.\    |
| 14 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done     |
| this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the  |
| field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the  |
| days of thy life:\                                                    |

| seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise    |

| conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire |
| shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.\                |
| 17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice  |
| of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee,   |
| saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake;  |
| in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;\             |
| 18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou    |
| shalt eat the herb of the field;\                                     |
| 19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return    |
| unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art,    |
| and unto dust shalt thou return.\                                     |
| 20 And Adam called his wife\'s name Eve; because she was the mother   |
| of all living.\                                                       |

| skins, and clothed them.\                                             |
| 22 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to  |
| know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take     |
| also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:\                |
| 23 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to  |
| till the ground from whence he was taken.\                            |
| 24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden   |

| 15 Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a      |
| man\'s covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or      |
| addeth thereto.\                                                      |
| 16 Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not,  |
| And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is    |
| Christ.\                                                              |
| 17 And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of    |
| God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years       |
| after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none       |
| effect.\                                                              |
| 18 For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise:    |
| but God gave it to Abraham by promise.\                               |
