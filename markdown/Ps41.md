| **Psalms 41. Beatus qui intelligit.**\                                |
| BLESSED is he that considereth the poor and needy; \* the LORD shall  |
| deliver him in the time of trouble.\                                  |
| 2 The LORD preserve him, and keep him alive, that he may be blessed   |
| upon earth; \* and deliver not thou him into the will of his          |
| enemies.\                                                             |
| 3 The LORD comfort him when he lieth sick upon his bed; \* make thou  |
| all his bed in his sickness.\                                         |
| 4 I said, LORD, be merciful unto me; \* heal my soul, for I have      |
| sinned against thee.\                                                 |
| 5 Mine enemies speak evil of me, \* When shall he die, and his name   |
| perish?\                                                              |
| 6 And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity, \* and his heart      |
| conceiveth falsehood within himself; and when he cometh forth, he     |
| telleth it.\                                                          |
| 7 All mine enemies whisper together against me; \* even against me do |
| they imagine this evil.\                                              |
| 8 An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him; \* and now that  |
| he lieth, he shall rise up no more.\                                  |
| 9 Yea, even mine own familiar friend whom I trusted, \* who did also  |
| eat of my bread, hath laid great wait for me.\                        |
| 10 But be thou merciful unto me, O LORD; \* raise thou me up again,   |
| and I shall reward them.\                                             |
| 11 By this I know thou favourest me, \* that mine enemy doth not      |
| triumph against me.\                                                  |
| 12 And in my innocency thou upholdest me, \* and shalt set me before  |
| thy face for ever.\                                                   |
| 13 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, \* world without end. Amen.     |
