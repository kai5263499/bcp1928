The Collect.

![ty](http://stats.superstats.com/b/ss/DAVIDMCMANNES/1){border="0"}

ALMIGHTY God, who hast given us thy only-begotten Son to take our nature
upon him, and as at this time to be born of a pure virgin; Grant that we
being regenerate, and made thy children by adoption and grace, may daily
be renewed by thy Holy Spirit; through the same our Lord Jesus Christ,
who liveth and reigneth with thee and the same Spirit ever, one God,
world without end. Amen.

*¶ This Collect is to be said daily throughout the Octave.*

The Epistle. Hebrews i. 1.

GOD, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto
the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by
his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made
the worlds; who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image
of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when
he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the
Majesty on high; being made so much better than the angels, as he hath
by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they. For unto which
of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I
begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to
me a Son? And again, when he bringeth in the first-begotten into the
world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him. And of the
angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a
flame of fire. But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever
and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom. Thou
hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy
God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. And,
Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and
the heavens are the works of thine hands: they shall perish; but thou
remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment; and as a
vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art
the same, and thy years shall not fail.\

The Gospel. St. John i. 1.

IN the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by
him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was
life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in
darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not. There was a man sent
from God, whose name was John. The same came for a witness, to bear
witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe. He was not
that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. That was the
true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. He was
in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.
He came unto his own, and his own received him not. But as many as
received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to
them that believe on his name: which were born, not of blood, nor of the
will of the flesh, nor of the will or man, but of God. And the Word was
made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as
of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.

###### *¶ If in any Church the Holy Communion be twice celebrated on Christmas Day, the following Collect, Epistle, and Gospel may be used at the first Communion.*

The Collect.

![q](http://stats.superstats.com/b/ss/DAVIDMCMANNES/1){border="0"}

GOD, who makest us glad with the yearly remembrance of the birth of
thine only Son Jesus Christ; Grant that as we joyfully receive him for
our Redeemer, so we may with sure confidence behold him when he shall
come to be our Judge, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy
Ghost, one God, world without end. Amen.\

The Epistle. Titus ii. 11.

THE grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,
teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live
soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; looking for that
blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our
Saviour Jesus Christ; who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us
from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of
good works. These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all
authority. Let no man despise thee.\

The Gospel. St. Luke ii. 1.

AND it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from
Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed. (And this taxing
was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.) And all went to be
taxed, every one into his own city. And Joseph also went up from
Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of
David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and
lineage of David :) to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great
with child. And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were
accomplished that she should be delivered. And she brought forth her
firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a
manger; because there was no room for them in the inn. And there were in
the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over
their flock by night. And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and
the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.
And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good
tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born
this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. And
this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in
swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. And suddenly there was with the
angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory
to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.
