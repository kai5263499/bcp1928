|                                                                       |
| For the Epistle. Acts x. 34.                                          |
|                                                                       |
| THEN Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God |
| is no respecter of persons: but in every nation he that feareth him,  |
| and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him. The word which God   |
| sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ:    |
| (he is Lord of all:) that word, I say, ye know, which was published   |
| throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism      |
| which John preached; how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy |
| Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that |
| were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him. And we are         |
| witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews,    |
| and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree: him God raised |
| up the third day, and shewed him openly; not to all the people, but   |
| unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and      |
| drink with him after he rose from the dead. And he commanded us to    |
| preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was        |
| ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead. To him give all    |
| the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in    |
| him shall receive remission of sins. While Peter yet spake these      |
| words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word. And they |
| of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came   |
| with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift |
| of the Holy Ghost. For they heard them speak with tongues, and        |
| magnify God. Then answered Peter, Can any man forbid water, that      |
| these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as   |
| well as we? And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the   |
| Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.\                    |
|                                                                       |
| The Gospel. St. John iii. 16.                                         |
|                                                                       |
| GOD so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that      |
| whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting    |
| life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world;   |
| but that the world through him might be saved. He that believeth on   |
| him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, |
| because he hath not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of  |
| God. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, |
| and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were    |
| evil. For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh  |
| to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth    |
| truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that  |
| they are wrought in God.                                              |
|                                                                       |
