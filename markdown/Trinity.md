| he did fly.\                                                          |

| of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.\                      |

| am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of     |
| unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.\   |
| 6 Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his   |
| hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:\          |
| 7 And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy   |
| lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.\          |

| before God in the order of his course,\                               |
| 9 According to the custom of the priest\'s office, his lot was to     |

| right side of the altar of incense.\                                  |

| is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou      |
| shalt call his name John.\                                            |

| neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy   |
| Ghost, even from his mother\'s womb.\                                 |
| 16 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their |
| God.\                                                                 |
| 17 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to    |

| I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.\                 |
| 19 And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in |
| the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to show thee |
| these glad tidings.\                                                  |

| so long in the temple.\                                               |

| 1 Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the |
| LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up |
| the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation       |
| throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,\      |
| 2 Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath given  |
| me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him |
| an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.\                            |
| 3 Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and  |
| let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of |
| the LORD God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is in Jerusalem.\      |
| 4 And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the   |
| men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, |
| and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God    |
| that is in Jerusalem.\                                                |
| 5 Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and    |
| the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had      |
| raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in           |
| Jerusalem.\                                                           |

| 1 Then said the high priest, Are these things so?\                    |
| 2 And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory  |
| appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before  |
| he dwelt in Charran,\                                                 |
| 3 And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy        |
| kindred, and come into the land which I shall show thee.\             |
| 4 Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in        |
| Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him    |
| into this land, wherein ye now dwell.\                                |
| 5 And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set   |
| his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a       |
| possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.\  |
| 6 And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a       |
| strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and       |
| entreat them evil four hundred years.\                                |
| 7 And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said  |
| God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this       |
| place.\                                                               |
| 8 And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat  |
| Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and |
| Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs.\                                   |
| 9 And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but    |
| God was with him,\                                                    |
| 10 And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour  |
| and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him     |
| governor over Egypt and all his house.\                               |
| 11 Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan,    |
| and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.\           |
| 12 But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our |
| fathers first.\                                                       |
| 13 And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and  |
| Joseph\'s kindred was made known unto Pharaoh.\                       |
| 14 Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his  |
| kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.\                               |

| of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD      |
| appeared unto all the congregation.\                                  |
| 20 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,\             |
| 21 Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may       |
| consume them in a moment.\                                            |

| all the congregation?\                                                |

| 24 Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the     |
| tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.\                             |

| 13 Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and  |
| the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and     |
| custom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings.\         |
| 14 Now because we have maintenance from the king\'s palace, and it    |

| that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which  |
| cause was this city destroyed.\                                       |

| 20 There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled |
| over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom,   |

| 35 This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a  |
| judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the     |
| hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush.\                 |
| 36 He brought them out, after that he had shown wonders and signs in  |
| the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty    |

| 37 This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A      |
| prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren,   |
| like unto me; him shall ye hear.\                                     |
| 38 This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the      |
| angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who |
| received the lively oracles to give unto us:\                         |
| 39 To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and  |
| in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,\                        |

| Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is  |
| become of him.\                                                       |
| 41 And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the |
| idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.\                  |
| 42 Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven;   |
| as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel,   |
| have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of     |
| forty years in the wilderness?\                                       |

| to the fashion that he had seen.\                                     |
| 45 Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into  |
| the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of |
| our fathers, unto the days of David;\                                 |

| 48 Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as  |
| saith the prophet,\                                                   |
| 49 Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will ye |
| build me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest?\           |

| and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.\            |

| 10 To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest,        |
| saying, This man is the great power of God.\                          |

| bewitched them with sorceries.\                                       |

| had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:\    |
| 15 Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might    |
| receive the Holy Ghost:\                                              |

| 19 Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands,   |
| he may receive the Holy Ghost.\                                       |

| lying in a manger.\                                                   |

| was told them concerning this child.\                                 |
| 18 And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were     |
| told them by the shepherds.\                                          |
| 19 But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.\   |
| 20 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all    |
| the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.\   |

| 26 And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go |
| toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto     |
| Gaza, which is desert.\                                               |
| 27 And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch   |
| of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the |
| charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to          |
| worship,\                                                             |
| 28 Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the          |
| prophet.\                                                             |
| 29 Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to     |
| this chariot.\                                                        |
| 30 And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet      |
| Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?\              |
| 31 And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he    |
| desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.\               |
| 32 The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a |
| sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so   |
| opened he not his mouth:\                                             |
| 33 In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall      |
| declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.\        |
| 34 And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom     |
| speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?\         |
| 35 Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and |
| preached unto him Jesus.\                                             |
| 36 And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and |
| the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be        |
| baptized?\                                                            |
| 37 And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou      |
| mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the  |
| Son of God.\                                                          |
| 38 And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down    |
| both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized      |
| him.\                                                                 |
| 39 And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the     |
| Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went |
| on his way rejoicing.\                                                |
| 40 But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in |
| all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.\                            |
