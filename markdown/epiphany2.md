| 1 Again the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,\            |
| 2 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with great     |
| jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury.\                 |
| 3 Thus saith the LORD; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the |
| midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth;    |
| and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain.\             |
| 4 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old women |
| dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff in    |
| his hand for very age.\                                               |
| 5 And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing |
| in the streets thereof.\                                              |
| 6 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it be marvellous in the eyes of    |
| the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be           |
| marvellous in mine eyes? saith the LORD of hosts.\                    |
| 7 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will save my people from    |
| the east country, and from the west country;\                         |
| 8 And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of         |
| Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in   |
| truth and in righteousness.\                                          |
| 20 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; It shall yet come to pass, that      |
| there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities:\         |
| 21 And the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, Let   |
| us go speedily to pray before the LORD, and to seek the LORD of       |
| hosts: I will go also.\                                               |
| 22 Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of |
| hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the LORD.\                     |
| 23 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; In those days it shall come to pass, |
| that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations,     |
| even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We    |
| will go with you: for we have heard that God is with you.\            |

| 1 Corinthians 12:12-31a**\                                            |
| 12 For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members |
| of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.\       |
| 13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be |
| Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made  |
| to drink into one Spirit.\                                            |
| 14 For the body is not one member, but many.\                         |
| 15 If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the  |
| body; is it therefore not of the body?\                               |
| 16 And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of    |
| the body; is it therefore not of the body?\                           |
| 17 If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the      |
| whole were hearing, where were the smelling?\                         |
| 18 But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as |
| it hath pleased him\                                                  |
| 19 And if they were all one member, where were the body?\             |
| 20 But now are they many members, yet but one body.\                  |
| 21 And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor  |
| again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.\                   |
| 22 Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more    |
| feeble, are necessary:\                                               |
| 23 And those members of the body, which we think to be less           |
| honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our        |
| uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.\                        |
| 24 For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body  |
| together, having given more abundant honour to that part which        |
| lacked:\                                                              |
| 25 That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members   |
| should have the same care one for another.\                           |
| 26 And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or  |
| one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.\             |
| 27 Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.\         |
| 28 And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily   |
| prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of        |
| healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.\                |
| 29 Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all      |
| workers of miracles?\                                                 |
| 30 Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all   |
| interpret?\                                                           |
| 31 But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet show I unto you a more |
| excellent way.\                                                       |

| of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates      |

| 7 I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create     |
| evil: I the LORD do all these things.\                                |
| 8 Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down      |

| salvation, and let righteousness spring up together; I the LORD have  |

| fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands?\      |
| 10 Woe unto him that saith unto his father, What begettest thou? or   |
| to the woman, What hast thou brought forth?\                          |

| 21 Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make  |
| one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?\                  |

| 24 Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of    |

| not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.\               |

| 23 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the     |
| head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.\               |
| 24 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives   |
| be to their own husbands in every thing.\                             |
| 25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church,   |

| loveth his wife loveth himself.\                                      |
| 29 For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and        |
| cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:\                          |
| 30 For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.\   |
| 31 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall  |
| be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.\            |
| 32 This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the     |
| church.\                                                              |

| have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.\        |

| 12 Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well,    |
| and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?\         |
| 13 Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water |
| shall thirst again:\                                                  |

| 40 So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that  |
| he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.\               |
| 41 And many more believed because of his own word;\                   |
| 42 And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy        |
| saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed |
