| **Psalms 47. Omnes gentes, plaudite.**\                               |
| CLAP your hands together, all ye peoples: \* O sing unto God with the |
| voice of melody.\                                                     |
| 2 For the LORD is high, and to be feared; \* he is the great King     |
| upon all the earth.\                                                  |
| 3 He shall subdue the peoples under us, \* and the nations under our  |
| feet.\                                                                |
| 4 He shall choose out an heritage for us, \* even the excellency of   |
| Jacob, whom he loved.\                                                |
| 5 God is gone up with a merry noise, \* and the LORD with the sound   |
| of the trump.\                                                        |
| 6 O sing praises, sing praises unto our God; \* O sing praises, sing  |
| praises unto our King.\                                               |
| 7 For God is the King of all the earth: \* sing ye praises with       |
| understanding.\                                                       |
| 8 God reigneth over the nations; \* God sitteth upon his holy seat.\  |
| 9 The princes of the peoples are joined unto the people of the God of |
| Abraham; \* for God, which is very high exalted, doth defend the      |
| earth, as it were with a shield.                                      |
