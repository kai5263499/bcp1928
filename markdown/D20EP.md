**Psalm 104. Benedic, anima mea.**\
PRAISE the LORD, O my soul: \* O LORD my God, thou art become exceeding
glorious; thou art clothed with majesty and honour.\
2 Thou deckest thyself with light as it were with a garment, \* and
spreadest out the heavens like a curtain.\
3 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters, \* and maketh the
clouds his chariot, and walketh upon the wings of the wind.\
4 He maketh his angels winds, \* and his ministers a flaming fire.\
5 He laid the foundations of the earth, \* that it never should move at
any time.\
6 Thou coveredst it with the deep like as with a garment; \* the waters
stand above the hills.\
7 At thy rebuke they flee; \* at the voice of thy thunder they haste
away.\
8 They go up as high as the hills, and down to the valleys beneath; \*
even unto the place which thou hast appointed for them.\
9 Thou hast set them their bounds, which they shall not pass, \* neither
turn again to cover the earth.\
10 He sendeth the springs into the rivers, \* which run among the
hills.\
11 All beasts of the field drink thereof, \* and the wild asses quench
their thirst.\
12 Beside them shall the fowls of the air have their habitation, \* and
sing among the branches.\
13 He watereth the hills from above; \* the earth is filled with the
fruit of thy works.\
14 He bringeth forth grass for the cattle, \* and green herb for the
service of men;\
15 That he may bring food out of the earth, and wine that maketh glad
the heart of man; \* and oil to make him a cheerful countenance, and
bread to strengthen man\'s heart.\
16 The trees of the LORD also are full of sap; \* even the cedars of
Lebanon which he hath planted;\
17 Wherein the birds make their nests; \* and the firtrees are a
dwelling for the stork.\
18 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; \* and so are the
stony rocks for the conies.\
19 He appointed the moon for certain seasons, \* and the sun knoweth his
going down.\
20 Thou makest darkness that it may be night; \* wherein all the beasts
of the forest do move.\
21 The lions, roaring after their prey, \* do seek their meat from God.\
22 The sun ariseth, and they get them away together, \* and lay them
down in their dens.\
23 Man goeth forth to his work, and to his labour, \* until the
evening.\
24 O LORD, how manifold are thy works! \* in wisdom hast thou made them
all; the earth is full of thy riches.\
25 So is the great and wide sea also; \* wherein are things creeping
innumerable, both small and great beasts.\
26 There go the ships, and there is that leviathan, \* whom thou hast
made to take his pastime therein.\
27 These wait all upon thee, \* that thou mayest give them meat in due
season.\
28 When thou givest it them, they gather it; \* and when thou openest
thy hand, they are filled with good.\
29 When thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: \* when thou takest
away their breath, they die, and are turned again to their dust.\
30 When thou lettest thy breath go forth, they shall be made; \* and
thou shalt renew the face of the earth.\
31 The glorious majesty of the LORD shall endure for ever; \* the LORD
shall rejoice in his works.\
32 The earth shall tremble at the look of him; \* if he do but touch the
hills, they shall smoke.\
33 I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live; \* I will praise my God
while I have my being.\
34 And so shall my words please him: \* my joy shall be in the LORD.\
35 As for sinners, they shall be consumed out of the earth, \* and the
ungodly shall come to an end.\
36 Praise thou the LORD, O my soul. \* Praise the LORD.
