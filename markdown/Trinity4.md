| salvation of the LORD.\                                               |
| 27 It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.\          |

| upon him.\                                                            |

| 24 The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his    |

| 25 It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the    |
| servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house      |
| Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?\      |
| 26 Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall  |
| not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.\                   |
| 27 What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye   |
| hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.\                  |
| 28 And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill    |
| the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and  |
| body in hell.\                                                        |

| 30 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.\                 |
| 31 Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.\   |
| 32 Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I        |
| confess also before my Father which is in heaven.\                    |
| 33 But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny       |
| before my Father which is in heaven.\                                 |
| 34 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to     |
| send peace, but a sword.\                                             |
| 35 For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the |

| 5 But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is  |
| a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;\               |

| 11 Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which |
| cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.\                        |
| 12 Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the  |
| Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?\               |
| 13 But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father    |
| hath not planted, shall be rooted up.\                                |

| 17 Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth |
| goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?\              |
| 18 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from    |
| the heart; and they defile the man.\                                  |
| 19 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,   |

| 2 And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, |
| whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not.\        |
| 3 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto    |

| conceive, and bear a son.\                                            |

| drink, and eat not any unclean thing:\                                |
| 5 For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall    |
| come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the |

| 6 Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came |
| unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of  |
| God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he was, neither told   |
| he me his name:\                                                      |

| God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we    |
| shall do unto the child that shall be born.\                          |

| again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband  |

| 11 And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man,    |
| and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And  |
| he said, I am.\                                                       |

| order the child, and how shall we do unto him?\                       |
| 13 And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said     |
| unto the woman let her beware.\                                       |

| virtue is gone out of me.\                                            |

| 15 In the mean while the king\'s officers, such as compelled the      |
| people to revolt, came into the city Modin, to make them sacrifice.\  |
| 16 And when many of Israel came unto them, Mattathias also and his    |
| sons came together.\                                                  |
| 17 Then answered the king\'s officers, and said to Mattathias on this |
| wise, Thou art a ruler, and an honourable and great man in this city, |
| and strengthened with sons and brethren:\                             |
| 18 Now therefore come thou first, and fulfil the king\'s commandment, |
| like as all the heathen have done, yea, and the men of Juda also, and |
| such as remain at Jerusalem: so shalt thou and thy house be in the    |
| number of the king\'s friends, and thou and thy children shall be     |
| honoured with silver and gold, and many rewards.\                     |
| 19 Then Mattathias answered and spake with a loud voice, Though all   |
| the nations that are under the king\'s dominion obey him, and fall    |
| away every one from the religion of their fathers, and give consent   |
| to his commandments:\                                                 |

| either on the right hand, or the left.\                               |
| 23 Now when he had left speaking these words, there came one of the   |
| Jews in the sight of all to sacrifice on the altar which was at       |
| Modin, according to the king\'s commandment.\                         |
| 24 Which thing when Mattathias saw, he was inflamed with zeal, and    |
| his reins trembled, neither could he forbear to shew his anger        |
| according to judgment: wherefore he ran, and slew him upon the        |
| altar.\                                                               |
| 25 Also the king\'s commissioner, who compelled men to sacrifice, he  |
| killed at that time, and the altar he pulled down.\                   |
| 26 Thus dealt he zealously for the law of God like as Phinees did     |
| unto Zambri the son of Salom.\                                        |
| 27 And Mattathias cried throughout the city with a loud voice,        |
| saying, Whosoever is zealous of the law, and maintaineth the\         |
| covenant, let him follow me.\                                         |

| they had in the city.\                                                |
| 29 Then many that sought after justice and judgment went down into    |

| nor stopped the places where they lay hid;\                           |

| came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:\             |
| 2 And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath   |

| certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and   |
| set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and  |
| sought to bring them out to the people.\                              |

| 10 And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night     |
| unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.\  |
| 11 These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they     |
| received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the        |
| scriptures daily, whether those things were so.\                      |

| know therefore what these things mean.\                               |
| 21 (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their  |
| time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new         |
| thing.)\                                                              |
| 22 Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars\' hill, and said, Ye men of   |
| Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.\      |
| 23 For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar    |
| with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye          |
| ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.\                          |
| 24 God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is  |
| Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;\   |
| 25 Neither is worshipped with men\'s hands, as though he needed any   |
| thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;\     |
| 26 And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all  |
| the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before           |
| appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;\                       |
| 27 That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after     |
| him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:\        |
| 28 For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also  |
| of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.\          |
| 29 Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to     |
| think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven |
| by art and man\'s device.\                                            |
| 30 And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth  |
| all men every where to repent:\                                       |
| 31 Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the    |
| world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he  |
| hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from    |
| the dead.\                                                            |
| []{#anchor597733}32 And when they heard of the resurrection of the    |
| dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this   |
| matter.\                                                              |
| 33 So Paul departed from among them.\                                 |
| 34 Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which  |
| was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others   |
| with them.\                                                           |
