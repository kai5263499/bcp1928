| **Psalm 101. Misericordiam et judicium.**\                            |
| MY song shall be of mercy and judgment; \* unto thee, O LORD, will I  |
| sing.\                                                                |
| 2 O let me have understanding \* in the way of godliness!\            |
| 3 When wilt thou come unto me? \* I will walk in my house with a      |
| perfect heart.\                                                       |
| 4 I will take no wicked thing in hand; I hate the sins of             |
| unfaithfulness; \* there shall no such cleave unto me.\               |
| 5 A froward heart shall depart from me; \* I will not know a wicked   |
| person.\                                                              |
| 6 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, \* him will I destroy.\     |
| 7 Whoso hath also a haughty look and a proud heart, \* I will not     |
| suffer him.\                                                          |
| 8 Mine eyes look upon such as are faithful in the land, \* that they  |
| may dwell with me.\                                                   |
| 9 Whoso leadeth a godly life, \* he shall be my servant.\             |
| 10 There shall no deceitful person dwell in my house; \* he that      |
| telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.\                            |
| 11 I shall soon destroy all the ungodly that are in the land; \* that |
| I may root out all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.            |
