| **Psalms 17. Exaudi, Domine.**\                                       |
| HEAR the right, O LORD, consider my complaint, \* and hearken unto my |
| prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.\                          |
| 2 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; \* and let thine eyes |
| look upon the thing that is equal.\                                   |
| 3 Thou hast proved and visited mine heart in the night season; thou   |
| hast tried me, and shalt find no wickedness in me; \* for I am        |
| utterly purposed that my mouth shall not offend.\                     |
| 4 As for the works of men, \* by the word of thy lips I have kept me  |
| from the ways of the destroyer.\                                      |
| 5 O hold thou up my goings in thy paths, \* that my footsteps slip    |
| not.\                                                                 |
| 6 I have called upon thee, O God, for thou shalt hear me: \* incline  |
| thine ear to me, and hearken unto my words.\                          |
| 7 Show thy marvellous loving-kindness, thou that art the Saviour of   |
| them which put their trust in thee, \* from such as resist thy right  |
| hand.\                                                                |
| 8 Keep me as the apple of an eye; \* hide me under the shadow of thy  |
| wings,\                                                               |
| 9 From the ungodly, that trouble me; \* mine enemies compass me round |
| about, to take away my soul.\                                         |
| 10 They are inclosed in their own fat, \* and their mouth speaketh    |
| proud things.\                                                        |
| 11 They lie waiting in our way on every side, \* watching to cast us  |
| down to the ground;\                                                  |
| 12 Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, \* and as it were a     |
| lion\'s whelp lurking in secret places.\                              |
| 13 Up, LORD, disappoint him, and cast him down; \* deliver my soul    |
| from the ungodly, by thine own sword;\                                |
| 14 Yea, by thy hand, O LORD; from the men of the evil world; \* which |
| have their portion in this life, whose bellies thou fillest with thy  |
| hid treasure.\                                                        |
| 15 They have children at their desire, \* and leave the rest of their |
| substance for their babes.\                                           |
| 16 But as for me, I shall behold thy presence in righteousness; \*    |
| and when I awake up after thy likeness, I shall be satisfied.         |
