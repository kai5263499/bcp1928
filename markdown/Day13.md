| **Psalm 68. Exsurgat Deus.**\                                         |
| LET God arise, and let his enemies be scattered; \* let them also     |
| that hate him flee before him.\                                       |
| 2 Like as the smoke vanisheth, so shalt thou drive them away; \* and  |
| like as wax melteth at the fire, so let the ungodly perish at the     |
| presence of God.\                                                     |
| 3 But let the righteous be glad, and rejoice before God; \* let them  |
| also be merry and joyful.\                                            |
| 4 O sing unto God, and sing praises unto his Name; magnify him that   |
| rideth upon the heavens; \* praise him in his Name JAH, and rejoice   |
| before him.\                                                          |
| 5 He is a Father of the fatherless, and defendeth the cause of the    |
| widows; \* even God in his holy habitation.\                          |
| 6 He is the God that maketh men to be of one mind in an house, and    |
| bringeth the prisoners out of captivity; \* but letteth the runagates |
| continue in scarceness.\                                              |
| 7 O God, when thou wentest forth before the people; \* when thou      |
| wentest through the wilderness,\                                      |
| 8 The earth shook, and the heavens dropped at the presence of God; \* |
| even as Sinai also was moved at the presence of God, who is the God   |
| of Israel.\                                                           |
| 9 Thou, O God, sentest a gracious rain upon thine inheritance, \* and |
| refreshedst it when it was weary.\                                    |
| 10 Thy congregation shall dwell therein; \* for thou, O God, hast of  |
| thy goodness prepared for the poor.\                                  |
| 11 The Lord gave the word; \* great was the company of women that     |
| bare the tidings.\                                                    |
| 12 Kings with their armies did flee, and were discomfited, \* and     |
| they of the household divided the spoil.\                             |
| 13 Though ye have lain among the sheep-folds, yet shall ye be as the  |
| wings of a dove \* that is covered with silver wings, and her         |
| feathers like gold.\                                                  |
| 14 When the Almighty scattered kings for their sake, \* then were     |
| they as white as snow in Salmon.\                                     |
| 15 As the hill of Bashan, so is God\'s hill; \* even an high hill, as |
| the hill of Bashan.\                                                  |
| 16 Why mock ye so, ye high hills? this is God\'s hill, in the which   |
| it pleaseth him to dwell; \* yea, the LORD will abide in it for       |
| ever.\                                                                |
| 17 The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels; |
| \* and the Lord is among them as in the holy place of Sinai.\         |
| 18 Thou art gone up on high, thou hast led captivity captive, and     |
| received gifts from men; \* yea, even from thine enemies, that the    |
| LORD God might dwell among them.\                                     |
| 19 Praised be the Lord daily, \* even the God who helpeth us, and     |
| poureth his benefits upon us.\                                        |
| 20 He is our God, even the God of whom cometh salvation: \* GOD is    |
| the Lord, by whom we escape death.\                                   |
| 21 God shall wound the head of his enemies, \* and the hairy scalp of |
| such a one as goeth on still in his wickedness.\                      |
| 22 The Lord hath said, I will bring my people again, as I did from    |
| Bashan; \* mine own will I bring again, as I did sometime from the    |
| deep of the sea.\                                                     |
| 23 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, \* and  |
| that the tongue of thy dogs may be red through the same.\             |
| 24 It is well seen, O God, how thou goest; \* how thou, my God and    |
| King, goest in the sanctuary.\                                        |
| 25 The singers go before, the minstrels follow after, \* in the midst |
| of the damsels playing with the timbrels.\                            |
| 26 Give thanks unto God the Lord in the congregation, \* ye that are  |
| of the fountain of Israel.\                                           |
| 27 There is little Benjamin their ruler, and the princes of Judah     |
| their council; \* the princes of Zebulon, and the princes of          |
| Naphthali.\                                                           |
| 28 Thy God hath sent forth strength for thee; \* stablish the thing,  |
| O God, that thou hast wrought in us,\                                 |
| 29 For thy temple\'s sake at Jerusalem; \* so shall kings bring       |
| presents unto thee.\                                                  |
| 30 Rebuke thou the dragon and the bull, with the leaders of the       |
| heathen, so that they humbly bring pieces of silver; \* scatter thou  |
| the peoples that delight in war;\                                     |
| 31 Then shall the princes come out of Egypt; \* the Morians\' land    |
| shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.\                           |
| 32 Sing unto God, O ye kingdoms of the earth; \* O sing praises unto  |
| the Lord;\                                                            |
| 33 Who sitteth in the heavens over all, from the beginning: \* lo, he |
| doth send out his voice; yea, and that a mighty voice.\               |
| 34 Ascribe ye the power to God over Israel; \* his worship and        |
| strength is in the clouds.\                                           |
| 35 O God, wonderful art thou in thy holy places: \* even the God of   |
| Israel, he will give strength and power unto his people. Blessed be   |
| God.\                                                                 |
|                                                                       |

| **Psalm 69. Salvum me fac.**\                                         |
| SAVE me, O God; \* for the waters are come in, even unto my soul.\    |
| 2 I stick fast in the deep mire, where no ground is; \* I am come     |
| into deep waters, so that the floods run over me.\                    |
| 3 I am weary of crying; my throat is dry; \* my sight faileth me for  |
| waiting so long upon my God.\                                         |
| 4 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my     |
| head; \* they that are mine enemies, and would destroy me guiltless,  |
| are mighty.\                                                          |
| 5 I paid them the things that I never took: \* God, thou knowest my   |
| simpleness, and my faults are not hid from thee.\                     |
| 6 Let not them that trust in thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed    |
| for my cause; \* let not those that seek thee be confounded through   |
| me, O Lord God of Israel.\                                            |
| 7 And why? for thy sake have I suffered reproof; \* shame hath        |
| covered my face.\                                                     |
| 8 I am become a stranger unto my brethren, \* even an alien unto my   |
| mother\'s children.\                                                  |
| 9 For the zeal of thine house hath even eaten me; \* and the rebukes  |
| of them that rebuked thee are fallen upon me.\                        |
| 10 I wept, and chastened myself with fasting, \* and that was turned  |
| to my reproof.\                                                       |
| 11 I put on sackcloth also, \* and they jested upon me.\              |
| 12 They that sit in the gate speak against me, \* and the drunkards   |
| make songs upon me.\                                                  |
| 13 But, LORD, I make my prayer unto thee \* in an acceptable time.\   |
| 14 Hear me, O God, in the multitude of thy mercy, \* even in the      |
| truth of thy salvation.\                                              |
| 15 Take me out of the mire, that I sink not; \* O let me be delivered |
| from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.\                  |
| 16 Let not the water-flood drown me, neither let the deep swallow me  |
| up; \* and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.\                   |
| 17 Hear me, O LORD, for thy loving-kindness is comfortable; \* turn   |
| thee unto me according to the multitude of thy mercies.\              |
| 18 And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: \* O  |
| haste thee, and hear me.\                                             |
| 19 Draw nigh unto my soul, and save it; \* O deliver me, because of   |
| mine enemies.\                                                        |
| 20 Thou hast known my reproach, my shame, and my dishonour: \* mine   |
| adversaries are all in thy sight.\                                    |
| 21 Reproach hath broken my heart; I am full of heaviness: \* I looked |
| for some to have pity on me, but there was no man, neither found I    |
| any to comfort me.\                                                   |
| 22 They gave me gall to eat; \* and when I was thirsty they gave me   |
| vinegar to drink.\                                                    |
| 23 Let their table be made a snare to take themselves withal; \* and  |
| let the things that should have been for their wealth be unto them an |
| occasion of falling.\                                                 |
| 24 Let their eyes be blinded, that they see not; \* and ever bow thou |
| down their backs.\                                                    |
| 25 Pour out thine indignation upon them, \* and let thy wrathful      |
| displeasure take hold of them.\                                       |
| 26 Let their habitation be void, \* and no man to dwell in their      |
| tents.\                                                               |
| 27 For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; \* and they talk    |
| how they may vex them whom thou hast wounded.\                        |
| 28 Let them fall from one wickedness to another, \* and not come into |
| thy righteousness.\                                                   |
| 29 Let them be wiped out of the book of the living, \* and not be     |
| written among the righteous.\                                         |
| 30 As for me, when I am poor and in heaviness, \* thy help, O God,    |
| shall lift me up.\                                                    |
| 31 I will praise the Name of God with a song, \* and magnify it with  |
| thanksgiving.\                                                        |
| 32 This also shall please the LORD \* better than a bullock that hath |
| horns and hoofs.\                                                     |
| 33 The humble shall consider this, and be glad: \* seek ye after God, |
| and your soul shall live.\                                            |
| 34 For the LORD heareth the poor, \* and despiseth not his            |
| prisoners.\                                                           |
| 35 Let heaven and earth praise him: \* the sea, and all that moveth   |
| therein.\                                                             |
| 36 For God will save Sion, and build the cities of Judah, \* that men |
| may dwell there, and have it in possession.\                          |
| 37 The posterity also of his servants shall inherit it; \* and they   |
| that love his Name shall dwell therein.\                              |
| \                                                                     |
| **\                                                                   |
| Psalm 70. Deus, in adjutorium.**\                                     |
| HASTE thee, O God, to deliver me; \* make haste to help me, O LORD.\  |
| 2 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul; \* let  |
| them be turned backward and put to confusion that wish me evil.\      |
| 3 Let them for their reward be soon brought to shame, \* that cry     |
| over me, There! there!\                                               |
| 4 But let all those that seek thee be joyful and glad in thee: \* and |
| let all such as delight in thy salvation say alway, The Lord be       |
| praised.\                                                             |
| 5 As for me, I am poor and in misery: \* haste thee unto me, O God.\  |
| 6 Thou art my helper, and my redeemer: \* O LORD, make no long        |
| tarrying.                                                             |
