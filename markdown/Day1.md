| **Psalm 1. Beatus vir qui non abiit.**\                               |
| BLESSED is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the         |
| ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, \* and hath not sat in the  |
| seat of the scornful.\                                                |
| 2 But his delight is in the law of the LORD; \* and in his law will   |
| he exercise himself day and night.\                                   |
| 3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the water-side, \* that will |
| bring forth his fruit in due season.\                                 |
| 4 His leaf also shall not wither; \* and look, whatsoever he doeth,   |
| it shall prosper.\                                                    |
| 5 As for the ungodly, it is not so with them; \* but they are like    |
| the chaff, which the wind scattereth away from the face of the        |
| earth.\                                                               |
| 6 Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stand in the judgment,   |
| \* neither the sinners in the congregation of the righteous.\         |
| 7 But the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous; \* and the way of    |
| the ungodly shall perish.\                                            |
| \                                                                     |
| **\                                                                   |
| Psalm 2. Quare fremuerunt gentes?**\                                  |
| WHY do the heathen so furiously rage together? \* and why do the      |
| people imagine a vain thing?\                                         |
| 2 The kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take counsel        |
| together \* against the LORD, and against his Anointed:\              |
| 3 Let us break their bonds asunder, \* and cast away their cords from |
| us.\                                                                  |
| 4 He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh them to scorn: \* the Lord   |
| shall have them in derision.\                                         |
| 5 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, \* and vex them in his  |
| sore displeasure:\                                                    |
| 6 Yet have I set my King \* upon my holy hill of Sion.\               |
| 7 I will rehearse the decree; \* the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art |
| my Son, this day have I begotten thee.\                               |
| 8 Desire of me, and I shall give thee the nations for thine           |
| inheritance, \* and the utmost parts of the earth for thy             |
| possession.\                                                          |
| 9 Thou shalt bruise them with a rod of iron, \* and break them in     |
| pieces like a potter\'s vessel.\                                      |
| 10 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings; \* be instructed, ye that are   |
| judges of the earth.\                                                 |
| 11 Serve the LORD in fear, \* and rejoice unto him with reverence.\   |
| 12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and so ye perish from the right    |
| way, if his wrath be kindled, yea but a little. \* Blessed are all    |
| they that put their trust in him.\                                    |
| \                                                                     |
| **\                                                                   |
| Psalm 3. Domine, quid multiplicati?**\                                |
| LORD, how are they increased that trouble me! \* many are they that   |
| rise against me.\                                                     |
| 2 Many one there be that say of my soul, \* There is no help for him  |
| in his God.\                                                          |
| 3 But thou, O LORD, art my defender; \* thou art my worship, and the  |
| lifter up of my head.\                                                |
| 4 I did call upon the LORD with my voice, \* and he heard me out of   |
| his holy hill.\                                                       |
| 5 I laid me down and slept, and rose up again; \* for the LORD        |
| sustained me.\                                                        |
| 6 I will not be afraid for ten thousands of the people, \* that have  |
| set themselves against me round about.\                               |
| 7 UP, LORD, and help me, O my God, \* for thou smitest all mine       |
| enemies upon the cheek-bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the        |
| ungodly.\                                                             |
| 8 Salvation belongeth unto the LORD; \* and thy blessing is upon thy  |
| people.\                                                              |
| \                                                                     |
| **\                                                                   |
| Psalm 4. Cum invocarem.**\                                            |
| HEAR me when I call, O God of my righteousness: \* thou hast set me   |
| at liberty when I was in trouble; have mercy upon me, and hearken     |
| unto my prayer.\                                                      |
| 2 O ye sons of men, how long will ye blaspheme mine honour, \* and    |
| have such pleasure in vanity, and seek after falsehood?\              |
| 3 Know this also, that the LORD hath chosen to himself the man that   |
| is godly; \* when I call upon the LORD he will hear me.\              |
| 4 Stand in awe, and sin not; \* commune with your own heart, and in   |
| your chamber, and be still.\                                          |
| 5 Offer the sacrifice of righteousness, \* and put your trust in the  |
| LORD.\                                                                |
| 6 There be many that say, \* Who will show us any good?\              |
| 7 LORD, lift thou up\* the light of thy countenance upon us.\         |
| 8 Thou hast put gladness in my heart; \* yea, more than when their    |
| corn and wine and oil increase.\                                      |
| 9 I will lay me down in peace, and take my rest; \* for it is thou,   |
| LORD, only, that makest me dwell in safety.\                          |
| \                                                                     |
| **\                                                                   |
| Psalm 5. Verba mea auribus.**\                                        |
| PONDER my words, O LORD, \* consider my meditation.\                  |
| 2 O hearken thou unto the voice of my calling, my King and my God: \* |
| for unto thee will I make my prayer.\                                 |
| 3 My voice shalt thou hear betimes, O LORD; \* early in the morning   |
| will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.\                 |
| 4 For thou art the God that hast no pleasure in wickedness; \*        |
| neither shall any evil dwell with thee.\                              |
| 5 Such as be foolish shall not stand in thy sight; \* for thou hatest |
| all them that work iniquity.\                                         |
| 6 Thou shalt destroy them that speak lies: \* the LORD will abhor     |
| both the blood-thirsty and deceitful man.\                            |
| 7 But as for me, in the multitude of thy mercy I will come into thine |
| house; \* and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.\     |
| 8 Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness, because of mine enemies; \*  |
| make thy way plain before my face.\                                   |
| 9 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; \* their inward parts  |
| are very wickedness.\                                                 |
| 10 Their throat is an open sepulchre; \* they flatter with their      |
| tongue.\                                                              |
| 11 Destroy thou them, O God; let them perish through their own        |
| imaginations; \* cast them out in the multitude of their ungodliness; |
| for they have rebelled against thee.\                                 |
| 12 And let all them that put their trust in thee rejoice: \* they     |
| shall ever be giving of thanks, because thou defendest them; they     |
| that love thy Name shall be joyful in thee;\                          |
| 13 For thou, LORD, wilt give thy blessing unto the righteous, \* and  |
| with thy favourable kindness wilt thou defend him as with a shield.\  |
|                                                                       |

| **Psalm 6. Domine, ne in furore.**\                                   |
| O LORD, rebuke me not in thine indignation, \* neither chasten me in  |
| thy displeasure.\                                                     |
| 2 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am weak; \* O LORD, heal me, for  |
| my bones are vexed.\                                                  |
| 3 My soul also is sore troubled: \* but, LORD, how long wilt thou     |
| punish me?\                                                           |
| 4 Turn thee, O LORD, and deliver my soul; \* O save me, for thy       |
| mercy\'s sake.\                                                       |
| 5 For in death no man remembereth thee; \* and who will give thee     |
| thanks in the pit?\                                                   |
| 6 I am weary of my groaning; \* every night wash I my bed, and water  |
| my couch with my tears.\                                              |
| 7 My beauty is gone for very trouble, \* and worn away because of all |

| 8 Away from me, all ye that work iniquity; \* for the LORD hath heard |
| the voice of my weeping.\                                             |
| 9 The LORD hath heard my petition; \* the LORD will receive my        |
| prayer.\                                                              |
| 10 All mine enemies shall be confounded, and sore vexed; \* they      |
| shall be turned back, and put to shame suddenly.\                     |
| \                                                                     |

| Psalm 7. Domine, Deus meus.**\                                        |
| O LORD my God, in thee have I put my trust: \* save me from all them  |
| that persecute me, and deliver me;\                                   |
| 2 Lest he devour my soul like a lion, and tear it in pieces, \* while |
| there is none to help.\                                               |
| 3 O LORD my God, if I have done any such thing; \* or if there be any |
| wickedness in my hands;\                                              |
| 4 If I have rewarded evil unto him that dealt friendly with me; \*    |
| (yea, I have delivered him that without any cause is mine enemy;)\    |
| 5 Then let mine enemy persecute my soul, and take me; \* yea, let him |
| tread my life down upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust.\  |
| 6 Stand up, O LORD, in thy wrath, and lift up thyself, because of the |
| indignation of mine enemies; \* arise up for me in the judgment that  |
| thou hast commanded.\                                                 |
| 7 And so shall the congregation of the peoples come about thee: \*    |
| for their sakes therefore lift up thyself again.\                     |
| 8 The LORD shall judge the peoples: give sentence with me, O LORD, \* |
| according to my righteousness, and according to the innocency that is |
| in me.\                                                               |
| 9 O let the wickedness of the ungodly come to an end; \* but guide    |
| thou the just.\                                                       |
| 10 For the righteous God \* trieth the very hearts and reins.\        |
| 11 My help cometh of God, \* who preserveth them that are true of     |
| heart.\                                                               |
| 12 God is a righteous Judge, strong, and patient; \* and God is       |
| provoked every day.\                                                  |
| 13 If a man will not turn, he will whet his sword; \* he hath bent    |
| his bow, and made it ready.\                                          |
| 14 He hath prepared for him the instruments of death; \* he ordaineth |
| his arrows against the persecutors.\                                  |
| 15 Behold, the ungodly travaileth with iniquity; \* he hath conceived |
| mischief, and brought forth falsehood.\                               |
| 16 He hath graven and digged up a pit, \* and is fallen himself into  |
| the destruction that he made for other.\                              |
| 17 For his travail shall come upon his own head, \* and his           |

| Psalm 8. Domine, Dominus noster.**\                                   |
| O LORD our Governor, how excellent is thy Name in all the world; \*   |
| thou that hast set thy glory above the heavens!\                      |
| 2 Out of the mouth of very babes and sucklings hast thou ordained     |
| strength, because of thine enemies, \* that thou mightest still the   |
| enemy and the avenger.\                                               |
| 3 When I consider thy heavens, even the work of thy fingers; \* the   |
| moon and the stars which thou hast ordained;\                         |
| 4 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? \* and the son of man,   |
| that thou visitest him?\                                              |
| 5 Thou madest him lower than the angels, \* to crown him with glory   |
| and worship.\                                                         |
| 6 Thou makest him to have dominion of the works of thy hands; \* and  |
| thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet:\               |
| 7 All sheep and oxen; \* yea, and the beasts of the field;\           |
| 8 The fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea; \* and whatsoever  |
| walketh through the paths of the seas.\                               |
| 9 O LORD our Governor, \* how excellent is thy Name in all the world! |
|                                                                       |
