| **Psalms 8. Domine, Dominus noster.**\                                |
| O LORD our Governor, how excellent is thy Name in all the world; \*   |
| thou that hast set thy glory above the heavens!\                      |
| 2 Out of the mouth of very babes and sucklings hast thou ordained     |
| strength, because of thine enemies, \* that thou mightest still the   |
| enemy and the avenger.\                                               |
| 3 When I consider thy heavens, even the work of thy fingers; \* the   |
| moon and the stars which thou hast ordained;\                         |
| 4 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? \* and the son of man,   |
| that thou visitest him?\                                              |
| 5 Thou madest him lower than the angels, \* to crown him with glory   |
| and worship.\                                                         |
| 6 Thou makest him to have dominion of the works of thy hands; \* and  |
| thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet:\               |
| 7 All sheep and oxen; \* yea, and the beasts of the field;\           |
| 8 The fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea; \* and whatsoever  |
| walketh through the paths of the seas.\                               |
| 9 O LORD our Governor, \* how excellent is thy Name in all the world! |
