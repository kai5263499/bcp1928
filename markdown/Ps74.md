| \                                                                     |

| **Psalm 74. Ut quid, Deus?**\                                         |
| O GOD, wherefore art thou absent from us so long? \* why is thy wrath |
| so hot against the sheep of thy pasture?\                             |
| 2 O think upon thy congregation, \* whom thou hast purchased, and     |
| redeemed of old.\                                                     |
| 3 Think upon the tribe of thine inheritance, \* and Mount Sion,       |
| wherein thou hast dwelt.\                                             |
| 4 Lift up thy feet, that thou mayest utterly destroy every enemy, \*  |
| which hath done evil in thy sanctuary.\                               |
| 5 Thine adversaries roar in the midst of thy congregations, \* and    |
| set up their banners for tokens.\                                     |
| 6 He that hewed timber afore out of the thick trees, \* was known to  |
| bring it to an excellent work.\                                       |
| 7 But now they break down all the carved work thereof \* with axes    |
| and hammers.\                                                         |
| 8 They have set fire upon thy holy places, \* and have defiled the    |
| dwelling-place of thy Name, even unto the ground.\                    |
| 9 Yea, they said in their hearts, Let us make havoc of them           |
| altogether: \* thus have they burnt up all the houses of God in the   |
| land.\                                                                |
| 10 We see not our tokens; there is not one prophet more; \* no, not   |
| one is there among us, that understandeth any more.\                  |
| 11 O God, how long shall the adversary do this dishonour? \* shall    |
| the enemy blaspheme thy Name for ever?\                               |
| 12 Why withdrawest thou thy hand? \* why pluckest thou not thy right  |
| hand out of thy bosom to consume the enemy?\                          |
| 13 For God is my King of old; \* the help that is done upon earth, he |
| doeth it himself.\                                                    |
| 14 Thou didst divide the sea through thy power; \* thou brakest the   |
| heads of the dragons in the waters.\                                  |
| 15 Thou smotest the heads of leviathan in pieces, \* and gavest him   |
| to be meat for the people of the wilderness.\                         |
| 16 Thou broughtest out fountains and waters out of the hard rocks; \* |
| thou driedst up mighty waters.\                                       |
| 17 The day is thine, and the night is thine; \* thou hast prepared    |
| the light and the sun.\                                               |
| 18 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth; \* thou hast made      |
| summer and winter.\                                                   |
| 19 Remember this, O LORD, how the enemy hath rebuked; \* and how the  |
| foolish people hath blasphemed thy Name.\                             |
| 20 O deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the multitude of    |
| the enemies; \* and forget not the congregation of the poor for       |
| ever.\                                                                |
| 21 Look upon the covenant; \* for all the earth is full of darkness   |
| and cruel habitations.\                                               |
| 22 O let not the simple go away ashamed; \* but let the poor and      |
| needy give praise unto thy Name.\                                     |
| 23 Arise, O God, maintain thine own cause; \* remember how the        |
| foolish man blasphemeth thee daily.\                                  |
| 24 Forget not the voice of thine enemies: \* the presumption of them  |
| that hate thee increaseth ever more and more.                         |
