      To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though

      <P>DEARLY beloved brethren, the Scripture moveth us, in sundry
      places, to acknowledge and confess our manifold sins and wickedness;
      and that we should not dissemble nor cloak them before the face
      of Almighty God our heavenly Father; but confess them with an
      humble, lowly, penitent, and obedient heart; to the end that
      we may obtain forgiveness of the same, by his infinite goodness
      and mercy. And although we ought, at all times, humbly to acknowledge
      our sins before God; yet ought we chiefly so to do, when we assemble
      and meet together to render thanks for the great benefits that
      we have received at his hands, to set forth his most worthy praise,
      to hear his most holy Word, and to ask those things which are
      requisite and necessary, as well for the body as the soul. Wherefore
      I pray and beseech you, as many as are here present, to accompany
      me with a pure heart, and humble voice, unto the throne of the
      heavenly grace, saying--<BR />
      </P>

      Congregation, after the Minister, all kneeling.</FONT></CENTER></P>

      <P>ALMIGHTY and most merciful Father; We have erred, and strayed
      from thy ways like lost sheep. We have followed too much the
      devices and desires of our own hearts. We have offended against
      thy holy laws. We have left undone those things which we ought
      to have done; And we have done those things which we ought not
      to have done; And there is no health in us. But thou, O Lord,
      have mercy upon us, miserable offenders. Spare thou those. O
      God, who confess their faults. Restore thou those who are penitent;
      According to thy promises declared unto mankind In Christ Jesus
      our Lord. And grant, O most merciful Father, for his sake; That
      we may hereafter live a godly, righteous, and sober life, To
      the glory of thy holy Name. Amen.<BR />

      <P>ALMIGHTY God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who desireth
      not the death of a sinner, but rather that he may turn from his
      wickedness and live, hath given power, and commandment, to his
      Ministers, to declare and pronounce to his people, being penitent,
      the Absolution and Remission of their sins. He pardoneth and
      absolveth all those who truly repent, and unfeignedly believe
      his holy Gospel.<BR />
<BR />
      Wherefore let us beseech him to grant us true repent- ance, and
      his Holy Spirit, that those things may please him which we do
      at this present; and that the rest of our life hereafter may
      be pure and holy; so that at the last we may come to his eternal
      joy; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</P>

      Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom

      A Collect for Peace.</B><BR />
      O God, from whom all holy desires, all good counsels, and all
      just works do proceed; Give unto thy servants that peace which
      the world cannot give; that our hearts may be set to obey thy
      commandments, and also that by thee, we, being defended from
      the fear of our enemies, may pass our time in rest and quietness;
      through the merits of Jesus Christ our Saviour. Amen.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>A Collect for Aid against Perils.</B><BR />
      Lighten our darkness, we beseech thee, O Lord; and by thy great
      mercy defend us from all perils and dangers of this night; for
      the love of thy only Son, our Saviour, Jesus Christ. Amen.</P>

      <P><BR />
      <B>A Prayer for The President of the United States, and all in
      Civil Authority.</B><BR />
      Almighty God, whose kingdom is everlasting and power infinite;
      Have mercy upon this whole land; and so rule the hearts of thy
      servants THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, The Governor of
      this State, and all others in authority, that they, knowing whose
      ministers they are, may above all things seek thy honour and
      glory; and that we and all the People, duly considering whose
      authority they bear, may faithfully and obediently honour them,
      according to thy blessed Word and ordinance; through Jesus Christ
      our Lord, who with thee and the Holy Ghost liveth and reigneth
      ever, one God, world without end. Amen.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>A Prayer for the Clergy and People.</B><BR />
      Almighty and everlasting God, from whom cometh every good and
      perfect gift; Send down upon our Bishops, and other Clergy, and
      upon the Congregations committed to their charge, the healthful
      Spirit of thy grace; and, that they may truly please thee, pour
      upon them the continual dew of thy blessing. Grant this, O Lord,
      for the honour of our Advocate and Mediator, Jesus Christ. Amen.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>A Prayer for all Conditions of Men.</B><BR />
      O God, the Creator and Preserver of all mankind, we humbly beseech
      thee for all sorts and conditions of men; that thou wouldest
      be pleased to make thy ways known unto them, thy saving health
      unto all nations. More especially we pray for thy holy Church
      universal; that it may be so guided and governed by thy good
      Spirit, that all who profess and call themselves Christians may
      be led into the way of truth, and hold the faith in unity of
      spirit, in the bond of peace, and in righteousness of life. Finally,
      we commend to thy fatherly goodness all those who are any ways
      afflicted, or distressed, in mind, body, or estate; that it may
      please thee to comfort and relieve them, according to their several
      necessities; giving them patience under their sufferings, and
      a happy issue out of all their afflictions. And this we beg for
      Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>A General Thanksgiving.</B><BR />
      Almighty God, Father of all mercies, we, thine unworthy servants,
      do give thee most humble and hearty thanks for all thy goodness
      and lovingkindness to us, and to all men; We bless thee for our
      creation, preservation, and all the blessings of this life; but
      above all, for thine inestimable love in the redemption of the
      world by our Lord Jesus Christ; for the means of grace, and for
      the hope of glory. And, we beseech thee, give us that due sense
      of all thy mercies that our hearts may be unfeignedly thankful;
      and that we show forth thy praise, not only with our lips, but
      in our lives, by giving up our selves to thy service, and by
      walking before thee in holiness and righteousness all our days;
      through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom, with thee and the Holy
      Ghost, be all honour and glory, world without end. Amen.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>A Prayer of St. Chrysostom.</B><BR />
      Almighty God, who hast given us grace at this time with one accord
      to make our common supplications unto thee; and dost promise
      that when two or three are gathered together in thy Name thou
      wilt grant their requests; Fulfil now, O Lord, the desires and
      petitions of thy servants, as may be most expedient for them;
      granting us in this world knowledge of thy truth, and in the
      world to come life everlasting. Amen.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>2 Cor. xiii. 14.</B><BR />
      The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and
      the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. Amen.</P>
