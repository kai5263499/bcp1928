      25 And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause
      the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell
      safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.<BR />
      26 And I will make them and the places round about my hill a
      blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season;
      there shall be showers of blessing.<BR />
      27 And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth
      shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land,
      and shall know that I am the LORD, when I have broken the bands
      of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those that
      served themselves of them.<BR />
      28 And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall
      the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely,
      and none shall make them afraid.<BR />
      29 And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall
      be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the
      shame of the heathen any more.<BR />
      30 Thus shall they know that I the LORD their God am with them,
      and that they, even the house of Israel, are my people, saith
      the Lord GOD.<BR />
      31 And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am
      your God, saith the Lord GOD.<BR />

      Luke 11:1-13</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place,
      when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach
      us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.<BR />
      2 And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which
      art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will
      be done, as in heaven, so in earth.<BR />
      3 Give us day by day our daily bread.<BR />
      4 And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that
      is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver
      us from evil.<BR />
      5 And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and
      shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend
      me three loaves;<BR />
      6 For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have
      nothing to set before him?<BR />
      7 And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the
      door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot
      rise and give thee.<BR />
      8 I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because
      he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise
      and give him as many as he needeth.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor2169874"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">9 And
      I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye
      shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.<BR />
      10 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth;
      and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.<BR />
      11 If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will
      he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish
      give him a serpent?<BR />
      12 Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?<BR />
      13 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your
      children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy
      Spirit to them that ask him?<BR />

      18 O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy
      peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of
      the sea:<BR />
      19 Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy
      bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been
      cut off nor destroyed from before me.<BR />
      20 Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a
      voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the
      end of the earth; say ye, The LORD hath redeemed his servant

      Revelation 5</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a
      book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.<BR />
      2 And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who
      is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?<BR />
      3 And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth,
      was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.<BR />
      4 And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and
      to read the book, neither to look thereon.<BR />
      5 And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the
      Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed
      to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.<BR />
      6 And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the
      four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as
      it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are
      the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.<BR />
      7 And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him
      that sat upon the throne.<BR />
      8 And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and
      twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of
      them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers
      of saints.<BR />
      9 And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the
      book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and
      hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and
      tongue, and people, and nation;<BR />
      10 And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall
      reign on the earth.<BR />
      11 And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about
      the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them
      was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;<BR />
      12 Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain
      to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour,
      and glory, and blessing.<BR />
      13 And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and
      under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are
      in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and
      power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the
      Lamb for ever and ever.<BR />
      14 And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders
      fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.<BR />

      5 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites
      are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in
      the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily
      I say unto you, They have their reward.<BR />
      6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when
      thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret;
      and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.<BR />
      7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen
      do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.<BR />
      8 Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth

      1 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the
      twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.<BR />
      2 My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;<BR />
      3 Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.<BR />
      4 But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect
      and entire, wanting nothing.<BR />
      5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth
      to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given
      him.<BR />
      6 But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth
      is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.<BR />
      7 For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing
      of the Lord.<BR />
      8 A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.<BR />
      9 Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:<BR />
      10 But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower
      of the grass he shall pass away.<BR />
      11 For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it
      withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the
      grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich
      man fade away in his ways.<BR />

      10 For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not
      as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst
      thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs:<BR />
      11 But the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills
      and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven:<BR />
      12 A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the
      LORD thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year
      even unto the end of the year.<BR />
      13 And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently
      unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the
      LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with
      all your soul,<BR />
      14 That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season,
      the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in
      thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.<BR />
      15 And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou
      mayest eat and be full.<BR />

      heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn

      17 And then the LORD'S wrath be kindled against you, and he shut
      up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield
      not her fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land
      which the LORD giveth you.<BR />

      No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one,
      and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise
      the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.<BR />
      25 Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what
      ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body,
      what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the
      body than raiment?<BR />
      26 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do
      they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth
      them. Are ye not much better than they?<BR />
      27 Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his
      stature?<BR />
      28 And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of
      the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:<BR />
      29 And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory
      was not arrayed like one of these.<BR />
      30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which
      today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much
      more clothe you, O ye of little faith?<BR />
      31 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or,
      What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?<BR />
      32 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your
      heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.<BR />

      seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and

      34 Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall
      take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day
      is the evil thereof.<BR />

      22 And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence
      of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands
      toward heaven:<BR />
      23 And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee,
      in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and
      mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their
      heart:<BR />
      24 Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst
      him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it
      with thine hand, as it is this day.<BR />
      25 Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David
      my father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail
      thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that
      thy children take heed to their way, that they walk before me
      as thou hast walked before me.<BR />
      26 And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified,
      which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.<BR />
      27 But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven
      and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this
      house that I have builded?<BR />
      28 Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and
      to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and
      to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee today:<BR />
      29 That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day,
      even toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall
      be there: that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy
      servant shall make toward this place.<BR />
      30 And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of
      thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and
      hear thou in heaven thy dwellingplace: and when thou hearest,
      forgive.<BR />

      8 Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your

      9 Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned
      to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.<BR />
      10 Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift
      you up.<BR />
      11 Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh
      evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of
      the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou
      art not a doer of the law, but a judge.<BR />
      12 There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy:
      who art thou that judgest another?<BR />

      1 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the dearth.<BR />
      2 Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black
      unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.<BR />
      3 And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters:
      they came to the pits, and found no water; they returned with
      their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered
      their heads.<BR />
      4 Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth,
      the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads.<BR />
      5 Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook it, because
      there was no grass.<BR />
      6 And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed
      up the wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because there
      was no grass.<BR />
      7 O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou it
      for thy name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned
      against thee.<BR />
      8 O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble,
      why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring

      5 Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth
      that Jesus is the Son of God?<BR />
      6 This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ;
      not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit
      that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.<BR />
      7 For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father,
      the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.<BR />
      8 And there are three that bear witness in earth, the spirit,
      and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.<BR />
      9 If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater:
      for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his
      Son.<BR />
      10 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself:
      he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth

      13 These things have I written unto you that believe on the name

      14 Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed
      into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our
      profession.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor2237694"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">15 For
      we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling
      of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we
      are, yet without sin.<BR />
      16 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that
      we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.<BR />
      1 For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for
      men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts
      and sacrifices for sins:<BR />
      2 Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are
      out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.<BR />
      3 And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for
      himself, to offer for sins.<BR />
      4 And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is
      called of God, as was Aaron.<BR />
      5 So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest;
      but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, today have I begotten
      thee.<BR />
      6 As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever
      after the order of Melchisedec.<BR />
      7 Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers
      and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that
      was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;<BR />

      he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he

      unto all them that obey him;<BR />
      10 Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.<BR />

      12 Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet,

      and twenty,)<BR />
      16 Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled,
      which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning
      Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.<BR />
