      22 It is of the LORD'S mercies that we are not consumed, because
      his compassions fail not.<BR />
      23 They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.<BR />
      24 The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope
      in him.<BR />
      25 The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul
      that seeketh him.<BR />
      26 It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for
      the salvation of the LORD.<BR />
      27 It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.<BR />
      28 He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne
      it upon him.<BR />
      29 He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.<BR />
      30 He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled
      full with reproach.<BR />
      31 For the Lord will not cast off for ever:<BR />
      32 But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according
      to the multitude of his mercies.<BR />

      Matthew 10:24-39</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      24 The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above
      his lord.<BR />
      25 It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and
      the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the
      house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?<BR />
      26 Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that
      shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.<BR />
      27 What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what
      ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.<BR />
      28 And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to
      kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both
      soul and body in hell.<BR />
      29 Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them
      shall not fall on the ground without your Father.<BR />
      30 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.<BR />
      31 Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.<BR />
      32 Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will
      I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.<BR />
      33 But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny
      before my Father which is in heaven.<BR />
      34 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not
      to send peace, but a sword.<BR />
      35 For I am come to set a man at variance against his father,
      and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law
      against her mother-in-law.<BR />
      36 And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.<BR />
      37 He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy
      of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not
      worthy of me.<BR />
      38 And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me,
      is not worthy of me.<BR />
      39 He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth
      his life for my sake shall find it.<BR />

      9 Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are
      drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong
      drink.<BR />
      10 For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep,

      Matthew 15:1-20</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem,
      saying,<BR />
      2 Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders?
      for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.<BR />
      3 But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress
      the commandment of God by your tradition?<BR />
      4 For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and,
      He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.<BR />
      5 But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother,
      It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;<BR />
      6 And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free.
      Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your
      tradition.<BR />
      7 Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,<BR />
      8 This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth
      me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor1073732"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">9 But
      in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments
      of men.<BR />
      10 And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and
      understand:<BR />
      11 Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that
      which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.<BR />
      12 Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that
      the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?<BR />
      13 But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father
      hath not planted, shall be rooted up.<BR />
      14 Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if
      the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.<BR />
      15 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this
      parable.<BR />
      16 And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?<BR />
      17 Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the
      mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?<BR />
      18 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth
      from the heart; and they defile the man.<BR />
      19 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,
      fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:<BR />
      20 These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen
      hands defileth not a man.<BR />

      2 And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the
      Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and
      bare not.<BR />
      3 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said
      unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou
      shalt conceive, and bear a son.<BR />
      4 Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong
      drink, and eat not any unclean thing:<BR />
      5 For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor
      shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto
      God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of
      the hand of the Philistines.<BR />
      6 Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of
      God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance
      of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence
      he was, neither told he me his name:<BR />
      7 But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear
      a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any
      unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from
      the womb to the day of his death.<BR />
      8 Then Manoah entreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the
      man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach
      us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.<BR />
      9 And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of
      God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah
      her husband was not with her.<BR />
      10 And the woman made haste, and ran, and showed her husband,
      and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that
      came unto me the other day.<BR />
      11 And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the
      man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the
      woman? And he said, I am.<BR />
      12 And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall
      we order the child, and how shall we do unto him?<BR />
      13 And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I
      said unto the woman let her beware.<BR />
      14 She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither
      let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing:
      all that I commanded her let her observe.<BR />
      24 And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and
      the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.<BR />

      16 No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a
      vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick,
      that they which enter in may see the light.<BR />
      17 For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither
      any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.<BR />
      18 Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him
      shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken
      even that which he seemeth to have.<BR />
      19 Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not
      come at him for the press.<BR />
      20 And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and
      thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.<BR />
      21 And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren
      are these which hear the word of God, and do it.<BR />
      22 Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a
      ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over
      unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.<BR />
      23 But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm
      of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were
      in jeopardy.<BR />
      24 And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master,
      we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging
      of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.<BR />
      25 And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being
      afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is
      this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey
      him.<BR />

      41 Moreover king Antiochus wrote to his whole kingdom, that all
      should be one people,<BR />
      42 And every one should leave his laws: so all the heathen agreed
      according to the commandment of the king.<BR />
      43 Yea, many also of the Israelites consented to his religion,
      and sacrificed unto idols, and profaned the sabbath.<BR />
      44 For the king had sent letters by messengers unto Jerusalem
      and the cities of Juda that they should follow the strange laws
      of the land,<BR />
      45 And forbid burnt offerings, and sacrifice, and drink offerings,
      in the temple; and that they should profane the sabbaths and
      festival days:<BR />
      46 And pollute the sanctuary and holy people:<BR />
      47 Set up altars, and groves, and chapels of idols, and sacrifice
      swine's flesh, and unclean beasts:<BR />
      48 That they should also leave their children uncircumcised,
      and make their souls abominable with all manner of uncleanness
      and profanation:<BR />
      49 To the end they might forget the law, and change all the ordinances.<BR />
      50 And whosoever would not do according to the commandment of
      the king, he said, he should die.<BR />
      51 In the selfsame manner wrote he to his whole kingdom, and
      appointed overseers over all the people, commanding the cities
      of Juda to sacrifice, city by city.<BR />
      52 Then many of the people were gathered unto them, to wit every
      one that forsook the law; and so they committed evils in the
      land;<BR />
      53 And drove the Israelites into secret places, even wheresoever
      they could flee for succour.<BR />

      36 And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again
      and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the
      word of the Lord, and see how they do.<BR />
      37 And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname
      was Mark.<BR />
      38 But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed
      from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.<BR />
      39 And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed
      asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed
      unto Cyprus;<BR />
      40 And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the
      brethren unto the grace of God.<BR />
      41 And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.<BR />
      1 Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple
      was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which
      was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:<BR />
      2 Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra
      and Iconium.<BR />
      3 Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised
      him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they
      knew all that his father was a Greek.<BR />
      4 And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the
      decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders
      which were at Jerusalem.<BR />
      5 And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased
      in number daily.<BR />

      4 And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the
      valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.<BR />
      5 And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said
      unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth,
      and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind
      him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven
      hundred pieces of silver.<BR />
      6 And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy
      great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to
      afflict thee.<BR />
      7 And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green
      withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as
      another man.<BR />
      8 Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green
      withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.<BR />
      9 Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber.
      And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson.
      And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it
      toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.<BR />
      10 And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me,
      and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest
      be bound.<BR />
      11 And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes
      that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another
      man.<BR />
      12 Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith,
      and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And
      there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake
      them from off his arms like a thread.<BR />
      13 And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me,

      over against Galilee.<BR />
      27 And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city
      a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes,
      neither abode in any house, but in the tombs.<BR />
      28 When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him,
      and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus,
      thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.<BR />
      29 (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the
      man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound
      with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven
      of the devil into the wilderness.)<BR />
      30 And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said,
      Legion: because many devils were entered into him.<BR />
      31 And they besought him that he would not command them to go
      out into the deep.<BR />
      32 And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain:
      and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into
      them. And he suffered them.<BR />
      33 Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the
      swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the
      lake, and were choked.<BR />
      34 When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and
      went and told it in the city and in the country.<BR />
      35 Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus,
      and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting
      at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they
      were afraid.<BR />
      36 They also which saw it told them by what means he that was

      38 Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought
      him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,<BR />

      54 Now the fifteenth day of the month Casleu, in the<BR />
      hundred forty and fifth year, they set up the abomination of
      desolation upon the altar, and builded idol altars throughout
      the<BR />
      cities of Juda on every side;<BR />
      55 And burnt incense at the doors of their houses, and in the
      streets.<BR />
      56 And when they had rent in pieces the books of the law which
      they found, they burnt them with fire.<BR />
      57 And whosoever was found with any the book of the testament,
      or if any committed to the law, the king's commandment was, that
      they should put him to death.<BR />
      58 Thus did they by their authority unto the Israelites every
      month, to as many as were found in the cities.<BR />
      59 Now the five and twentieth day of the month they did sacrifice
      upon the idol altar, which was upon the altar of God.<BR />
      60 At which time according to the commandment they put to death
      certain women, that had caused their children to be circumcised.<BR />
      61 And they hanged the infants about their necks, and rifled
      their houses, and slew them that had circumcised them.<BR />
      62 Howbeit many in Israel were fully resolved and confirmed in
      themselves not to eat any unclean thing.<BR />
      63 Wherefore the rather to die, that they might not be defiled
      with meats, and that they might not profane the holy covenant:

      Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia,
      and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,<BR />
      7 After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia:
      but the Spirit suffered them not.<BR />
      8 And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.<BR />
      9 And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man
      of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia,
      and help us.<BR />
      10 And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured
      to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called
      us for to preach the gospel unto them.<BR />
      11 Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course
      to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;<BR />
      12 And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that
      part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding
      certain days.<BR />
      13 And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side,
      where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake
      unto the women which resorted thither.<BR />
      14 And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the
      city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart
      the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were
      spoken of Paul.<BR />
      15 And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought
      us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord,
      come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us.<BR />
      16 And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel
      possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her

      16 And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words,

      17 That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath
      not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto
      God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will
      go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.<BR />
      18 And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she

      40 And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people
      gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.<BR />
      41 And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler
      of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought
      him that he would come into his house:<BR />
      42 For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and
      she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.<BR />
      43 And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had
      spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed
      of any,<BR />
      44 Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and
      immediately her issue of blood stanched.<BR />
      45 And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and
      they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee
      and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?<BR />
      46 And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that
      virtue is gone out of me.<BR />
      47 And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling,
      and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all
      the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was
      healed immediately.<BR />
      48 And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith
      hath made thee whole; go in peace.<BR />
      49 While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the
      synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble
      not the Master.<BR />
      50 But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not:
      believe only, and she shall be made whole.<BR />
      51 And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go
      in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother
      of the maiden.<BR />
      52 And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she
      is not dead, but sleepeth.<BR />
      53 And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.<BR />
      54 And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called,
      saying, Maid, arise.<BR />
      55 And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and
      he commanded to give her meat.<BR />
      56 And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that
      they should tell no man what was done.<BR />

      23 Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for
      to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice:
      for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our
      hand.<BR />
      24 And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they
      said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the
      destroyer of our country, which slew many of us.<BR />
      25 And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they
      said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called
      for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and
      they set him between the pillars.<BR />
      26 And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer
      me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth,
      that I may lean upon them.<BR />
      27 Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords
      of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about
      three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.<BR />
      28 And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, remember
      me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once,
      O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my
      two eyes.<BR />
      29 And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which
      the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with
      his right hand, and of the other with his left.<BR />
      30 And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed
      himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords,
      and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which
      he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his
      life.<BR />
      31 Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down,
      and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah

      1 Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them

      2 And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal

      8 And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one

      12 And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve,
      and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go
      into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals:
      for we are here in a desert place.<BR />
      13 But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said,
      We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should
      go and buy meat for all this people.<BR />
      14 For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his
      disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.<BR />
      15 And they did so, and made them all sit down.<BR />
      16 Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking
      up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples
      to set before the multitude.<BR />

      1 Maccabees 2:15-30</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      15 In the mean while the king's officers, such as compelled the
      people to revolt, came into the city Modin, to make them sacrifice.<BR />
      16 And when many of Israel came unto them, Mattathias also and
      his sons came together.<BR />
      17 Then answered the king's officers, and said to Mattathias
      on this wise, Thou art a ruler, and an honourable and great man
      in this city, and strengthened with sons and brethren:<BR />
      18 Now therefore come thou first, and fulfil the king's commandment,
      like as all the heathen have done, yea, and the men of Juda also,
      and such as remain at Jerusalem: so shalt thou and thy house
      be in the number of the king's friends, and thou and thy children
      shall be honoured with silver and gold, and many rewards.<BR />
      19 Then Mattathias answered and spake with a loud voice, Though
      all the nations that are under the king's dominion obey him,
      and fall away every one from the religion of their fathers, and
      give consent to his commandments:<BR />
      20 Yet will I and my sons and my brethren walk in the covenant
      of our fathers.<BR />
      21 God forbid that we should forsake the law and the ordinances.<BR />
      22 We will not hearken to the king's words, to go from our religion,
      either on the right hand, or the left.<BR />
      23 Now when he had left speaking these words, there came one
      of the Jews in the sight of all to sacrifice on the altar which
      was at Modin, according to the king's commandment.<BR />
      24 Which thing when Mattathias saw, he was inflamed with zeal,
      and his reins trembled, neither could he forbear to shew his
      anger according to judgment: wherefore he ran, and slew him upon
      the altar.<BR />
      25 Also the king's commissioner, who compelled men to sacrifice,
      he killed at that time, and the altar he pulled down.<BR />
      26 Thus dealt he zealously for the law of God like as Phinees
      did unto Zambri the son of Salom.<BR />
      27 And Mattathias cried throughout the city with a loud voice,
      saying, Whosoever is zealous of the law, and maintaineth the<BR />
      covenant, let him follow me.<BR />
      28 So he and his sons fled into the mountains, and left all that
      ever they had in the city.<BR />
      29 Then many that sought after justice and judgment went down
      into the wilderness, to dwell there:<BR />
      30 Both they, and their children, and their wives; and their
      cattle; because afflictions increased sore upon them.<BR />

      25 And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto
      God: and the prisoners heard them.<BR />
      26 And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations
      of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were
      opened, and every one's bands were loosed.<BR />
      27 And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and
      seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would
      have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.<BR />
      28 But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm:
      for we are all here.<BR />
      29 Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling,
      and fell down before Paul and Silas,<BR />
      30 And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be
      saved?<BR />
      31 And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou
      shalt be saved, and thy house.<BR />
      32 And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that
      were in his house.<BR />
      33 And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their
      stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.<BR />
      34 And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before
      them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.<BR />
      35 And when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying,
      Let those men go.<BR />
      36 And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The
      magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and
      go in peace.<BR />
      37 But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned,
      being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust
      us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and
      fetch us out.<BR />
      38 And the sergeants told these words unto the magistrates: and
      they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.<BR />
      39 And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and
      desired them to depart out of the city.<BR />
      40 And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house
      of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted
      them, and departed.<BR />

      1 Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that
      there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem-judah
      went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and
      his two sons.<BR />
      2 And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his
      wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion,
      Ephrathites of Bethlehem-judah. And they came into the country
      of Moab, and continued there.<BR />
      3 And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her
      two sons.<BR />
      4 And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of
      the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled
      there about ten years.<BR />
      5 And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman
      was left of her two sons and her husband.<BR />
      6 Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return
      from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of
      Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them
      bread.<BR />
      7 Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and
      her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to
      return unto the land of Judah.<BR />
      8 And Naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each
      to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have
      dealt with the dead, and with me.<BR />
      9 The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the
      house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up
      their voice, and wept.<BR />
      10 And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto
      thy people.<BR />
      11 And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with
      me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be
      your husbands?<BR />
      12 Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to
      have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have
      an husband also tonight, and should also bear sons;<BR />
      13 Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay
      for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth
      me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out
      against me.<BR />
      14 And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah
      kissed her mother-in-law; but Ruth clave unto her.<BR />

      18 And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples
      were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people
      that I am?<BR />
      19 They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias;
      and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again.<BR />
      20 He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering
      said, The Christ of God.<BR />
      21 And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no
      man that thing;<BR />
      22 Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected
      of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and
      be raised the third day.<BR />
      23 And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let
      him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.<BR />
      24 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever
      will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.<BR />
      25 For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world,
      and lose himself, or be cast away?<BR />
      26 For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him
      shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own
      glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.<BR />
      27 But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which
      shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.<BR />

      31 Now when it was told the king's servants, and the host that
      was at Jerusalem, in the city of David, that certain men, who
      had broken the king's commandment, were gone down into the secret
      places in the wilderness,<BR />
      32 They pursued after them a great number, and having overtaken
      them, they camped against them, and made war against them on
      the sabbath day.<BR />
      33 And they said unto them, Let that which ye have done hitherto
      suffice; come forth, and do according to the commandment of the
      king, and ye shall live.<BR />
      34 But they said, We will not come forth, neither will we do
      the king's commandment, to profane the sabbath day.<BR />
      35 So then they gave them the battle with all speed.<BR />
      36 Howbeit they answered them not, neither cast they a stone
      at them, nor stopped the places where they lay hid;<BR />
      37 But said, Let us die all in our innocency: heaven and earth
      will testify for us, that ye put us to death wrongfully.<BR />
      38 So they rose up against them in battle on the sabbath, and
      they slew them, with their wives and children and their cattle,
      to the number of a thousand people.<BR />
      39 Now when Mattathias and his friends understood hereof, they
      mourned for them right sore.<BR />
      40 And one of them said to another, If we all do as our brethren
      have done, and fight not for our lives and laws against the heathen,
      they will now quickly root us out of the earth.<BR />
      41 At that time therefore they decreed, saying, Whosoever shall
      come to make battle with us on the sabbath day, we will fight<BR />
      against him; neither will we die all, as our brethren that were
      murdered in the secret places.<BR />
      42 Then came there unto him a company of Assideans who were mighty
      men of Israel, even all such as were voluntarily devoted unto
      the law.<BR />
      43 Also all they that fled for persecution joined themselves
      unto them, and were a stay unto them.<BR />

      1 Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia,
      they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:<BR />
      2 And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath
      days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,<BR />
      3 Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered,
      and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach
      unto you, is Christ.<BR />
      4 And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas;
      and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief
      women not a few.<BR />
      5 But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto
      them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company,
      and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of
      Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.<BR />
      6 And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren
      unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the
      world upside down are come hither also;<BR />
      7 Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the
      decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.<BR />
      8 And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when
      they heard these things.<BR />
      9 And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other,
      they let them go.<BR />
      10 And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night
      unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the
      Jews.<BR />
      11 These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that
      they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched
      the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.<BR />
      12 Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women
      which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.<BR />
      13 But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word
      of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also,
      and stirred up the people.<BR />
      14 And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as
      it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.<BR />
      15 And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and
      receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come
      to him with all speed, they departed.<BR />

      15 And she said, Behold, thy sister-in-law is gone back unto
      her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister-in-law.<BR />
      16 And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return
      from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go;
      and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my
      people, and thy God my God:<BR />
      17 Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried:
      the LORD do so to me, and more also, if aught but death part
      thee and me.<BR />
      18 When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her,
      then she left speaking unto her.<BR />
      19 So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came
      to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city
      was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?<BR />
      20 And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for
      the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.<BR />
      21 I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me home again empty:
      why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against
      me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?<BR />
      22 So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law,
      with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they

      he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain
      to pray.<BR />
      29 And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered,
      and his raiment was white and glistering.<BR />
      30 And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses
      and Elias:<BR />
      31 Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should
      accomplish at Jerusalem.<BR />
      32 But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep:

      </FONT><A NAME="anchor575165"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">33 And
      it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus,
      Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles;
      one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing
      what he said.<BR />
      34 While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed
      them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.<BR />
      35 And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my
      beloved Son: hear him.<BR />
      36 And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they
      kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things
      which they had seen.<BR />
      37 And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were
      come down from the hill, much people met him.<BR />
      38 And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master,
      I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.<BR />
      39 And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out;
      and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly
      departeth from him.<BR />
      40 And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could
      not.<BR />
      41 And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation,
      how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.<BR />
      42 And as he was yet a-coming, the devil threw him down, and
      tare him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the
      child, and delivered him again to his father.<BR />
      43 And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while
      they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said
      unto his disciples,<BR />
      44 Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of
      man shall be delivered into the hands of men.<BR />
      45 But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them,
      that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that
      saying.<BR />

      found, because he is returned into his dust, and his thought
      is come to nothing.<BR />
      64 Wherefore, ye my sons, be valiant and shew yourselves men
      in the behalf of the law; for by it shall ye obtain glory.<BR />
      65 And behold, I know that your brother Simon is a man of counsel,
      give ear unto him alway: he shall be a father unto you.<BR />
      66 As for Judas Maccabeus, he hath been mighty and strong, even
      from his youth up: let him be your captain, and fight the battle
      of the people.<BR />
      67 Take also unto you all those that observe the law, and avenge
      ye the wrong of your people.<BR />
      68 Recompense fully the heathen, and take heed to the commandments
      of the law.<BR />
      69 So he blessed them, and was gathered to his fathers.<BR />
      70 And he died in the hundred forty and sixth year, and his sons
      buried him in the sepulchres of his fathers at Modin, and all
      Israel made great lamentation for him.<BR />

      Lesson<BR />
      Acts 17:16-34</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      16 Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred
      in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.<BR />
      17 Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and
      with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that
      met with him.<BR />
      18 Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoics,
      encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other
      some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because
      he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.<BR />
      19 And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying,
      May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?<BR />
      20 For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would
      know therefore what these things mean.<BR />
      21 (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent
      their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some
      new thing.)<BR />
      22 Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men
      of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.<BR />
      23 For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an
      altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore
      ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.<BR />
      24 God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that
      he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made
      with hands;<BR />
      25 Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed
      any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all
      things;<BR />
      26 And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell
      on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before
      appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;<BR />
      27 That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after
      him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:<BR />
      28 For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain
      also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.<BR />
      29 Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not
      to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone,
      graven by art and man's device.<BR />
      30 And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth
      all men every where to repent:<BR />
      31 Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge
      the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained;
      whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath
      raised him from the dead.<BR />

      when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked:
      and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter.<BR />
      33 So Paul departed from among them.<BR />
      34 Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the
      which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris,
      and others with them.<BR />
