      1 Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that
      there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem-judah
      went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and
      his two sons.<BR />
      2 And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his
      wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion,
      Ephrathites of Bethlehem-judah. And they came into the country
      of Moab, and continued there.<BR />
      3 And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her
      two sons.<BR />
      4 And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of
      the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled
      there about ten years.<BR />
      5 And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman
      was left of her two sons and her husband.<BR />
      6 Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return
      from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of
      Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them
      bread.<BR />
      7 Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and
      her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to
      return unto the land of Judah.<BR />
      8 And Naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each
      to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have
      dealt with the dead, and with me.<BR />
      9 The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the
      house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up
      their voice, and wept.<BR />
      10 And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto
      thy people.<BR />
      11 And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with
      me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be
      your husbands?<BR />
      12 Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to
      have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have
      an husband also tonight, and should also bear sons;<BR />
      13 Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay
      for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth
      me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out
      against me.<BR />
      14 And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah
      kissed her mother-in-law; but Ruth clave unto her.<BR />
      15 And she said, Behold, thy sister-in-law is gone back unto
      her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister-in-law.<BR />
      16 And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return
      from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go;
      and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my
      people, and thy God my God:<BR />

      thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD

      5 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication,
      uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness,
      which is idolatry:<BR />
      6 For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children
      of disobedience:<BR />
      7 In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.<BR />
      8 But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy,
      filthy communication out of your mouth.<BR />
      9 Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old
      man with his deeds;<BR />
      10 And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge
      after the image of him that created him:<BR />
      11 Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision,
      Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in
      all.<BR />

      12 Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat:
      for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about.<BR />
      13 Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you
      down; for the press is full, the vats overflow; for their wickedness
      is great.<BR />

      Matthew 13:36-52</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      36 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house:
      and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the
      parable of the tares of the field.<BR />
      37 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed
      is the Son of man;<BR />
      38 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of
      the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;<BR />
      39 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the
      end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.<BR />
      40 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire;
      so shall it be in the end of this world.<BR />
      41 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall
      gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which
      do iniquity;<BR />
      42 And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be
      wailing and gnashing of teeth.<BR />
      43 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom
      of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.<BR />
      44 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in
      a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for
      joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that
      field.<BR />
      45 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man,
      seeking goodly pearls:<BR />
      46 Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and
      sold all that he had, and bought it.<BR />
      47 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was
      cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:<BR />
      48 Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down,
      and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.<BR />
      49 So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come
      forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,<BR />
      50 And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall
      be wailing and gnashing of teeth.<BR />
      51 Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things?
      They say unto him, Yea, Lord.<BR />
      52 Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed
      unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder,
      which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.<BR />

      to him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears.<BR />
      18 As a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death,<BR />
      19 So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am
      not I in sport?<BR />
      20 Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there
      is no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.<BR />
      21 As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a contentious
      man to kindle strife.<BR />
      22 The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down
      into the innermost parts of the belly.<BR />
      23 Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered
      with silver dross.<BR />
      24 He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit
      within him;<BR />
      25 When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven
      abominations in his heart.<BR />
      26 Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be
      showed before the whole congregation.<BR />
      27 Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth
      a stone, it will return upon him.<BR />
      28 A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it; and
      a flattering mouth worketh ruin.<BR />

      ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are
      in heaviness through manifold temptations:<BR />
      7 That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than
      of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be
      found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus
      Christ:<BR />
      8 Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him
      not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full
      of glory:<BR />

      souls.<BR />
      10 Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched
      diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto
      you:<BR />
      11 Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ
      which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the
      sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.<BR />

      us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto

      things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received
      by tradition from your fathers;<BR />
      19 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without
      blemish and without spot:<BR />
      20 Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world,
      but was manifest in these last times for you,<BR />
      21 Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the
      dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in
      God.<BR />
      22 Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through
      the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love
      one another with a pure heart fervently:<BR />
      23 Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible,
      by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.<BR />
      24 For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the
      flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof
      falleth away:<BR />
      25 But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the
      word which by the gospel is preached unto you.<BR />

      2 But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully
      entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to
      speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.<BR />
      3 For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness,
      nor in guile:<BR />
      4 But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel,
      even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth
      our hearts.<BR />
      5 For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know,
      nor a cloak of covetousness; God is witness:<BR />
      6 Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others,
      when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.<BR />
      7 But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her
      children:<BR />
      8 So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to
      have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also
      our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.<BR />
      9 For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring
      night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of

      13 For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because,

      1 Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses,
      and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen,
      because they are very strong; but they look not unto the Holy
      One of Israel, neither seek the LORD!<BR />
      2 Yet he also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call
      back his words: but will arise against the house of the evildoers,
      and against the help of them that work iniquity.<BR />
      3 Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh,
      and not spirit. When the LORD shall stretch out his hand, both
      he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is holpen shall fall
      down, and they all shall fail together.<BR />
      4 For thus hath the LORD spoken unto me, Like as the lion and
      the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds
      is called forth against him, he will not be afraid of their voice,
      nor abase himself for the noise of them: so shall the LORD of
      hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and for the hill thereof.<BR />

      11 The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that

      12 She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.<BR />

      15 She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to
      her household, and a portion to her maidens.<BR />
      16 She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of
      her hands she planteth a vineyard.<BR />
      17 She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her

      22 She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is
      silk and purple.<BR />
      23 Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the
      elders of the land.<BR />
      24 She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles
      unto the merchant.<BR />
      25 Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice

      26 She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the
      law of kindness.<BR />
      27 She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth
      not the bread of idleness.<BR />
      28 Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also,
      and he praiseth her.<BR />
      29 Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them
      all.<BR />
      30 Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that
      feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.<BR />

      not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit,
      which is in the sight of God of great price.<BR />
      5 For after this manner in the old time the holy women also,
      who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto
      their own husbands:<BR />

      whence it riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt
      not be able to put it off: and desolation shall come upon thee
      suddenly, which thou shalt not know.<BR />
      12 Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude
      of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth;
      if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail.<BR />
      13 Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now
      the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators,
