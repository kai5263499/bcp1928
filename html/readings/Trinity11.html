      12 LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought
      all our works in us.<BR />
      13 O LORD our God, other lords beside thee have had dominion
      over us: but by thee only will we make mention of thy name.<BR />
      14 They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they
      shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them,
      and made all their memory to perish.<BR />
      15 Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased
      the nation: thou art glorified: thou hadst removed it far unto
      all the ends of the earth.<BR />
      16 LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a
      prayer when thy chastening was upon them.<BR />

      26 Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know
      not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself
      maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.<BR />
      27 And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind
      of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints
      according to the will of God.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor158531"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">28 And
      we know that all things work together for good to them that love
      God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.<BR />
      29 For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed
      to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among
      many brethren.<BR />
      30 Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and
      whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified,
      them he also glorified.<BR />
      31 What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us,
      who can be against us?<BR />
      32 He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us
      all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?<BR />
      33 Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is
      God that justifieth.<BR />
      34 Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather,
      that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who
      also maketh intercession for us.<BR />
      35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation,
      or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril,
      or sword?<BR />
      36 As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long;
      we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.<BR />
      37 Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through
      him that loved us.<BR />
      38 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels,
      nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things
      to come,<BR />
      39 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able
      to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus
      our Lord.<BR />

      10 Give unto the most High according as he hath enriched thee;
      and as thou hast gotten, give with a cheerful eye.<BR />
      11 For the Lord recompenseth, and will give thee seven times
      as much.<BR />
      12 Do not think to corrupt with gifts; for such he will not receive:
      and trust not to unrighteous sacrifices; for the Lord is judge,
      and with him is no respect of persons.<BR />
      13 He will not accept any person against a poor man, but will
      hear the prayer of the oppressed.<BR />
      14 He will not despise the supplication of the fatherless; nor
      the widow, when she poureth out her complaint.<BR />
      15 Do not the tears run down the widow's cheeks? and is not her
      cry against him that causeth them to fall?<BR />

      the most High shall behold to judge righteously, and execute
      judgment.<BR />
      18 For the Lord will not be slack, neither will the Mighty be
      patient toward them, till he have smitten in sunder the loins
      of the unmerciful, and repayed vengeance to the heathen; till
      he have taken away the multitude of the proud, and broken the
      sceptre of the unrighteous;<BR />
      19 Till he have rendered to every man according to his deeds,
      and to the works of men according to their devices; till he have

      39 And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms

      cast in much.<BR />
      42 And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two
      mites, which make a farthing.<BR />
      43 And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them,
      Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in,
      than all they which have cast into the treasury:<BR />
      44 For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her
      want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.<BR />

      1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel
      fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount
      Gilboa.<BR />
      2 And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons;
      and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchi-shua,
      Saul's sons.<BR />
      3 And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit
      him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.<BR />
      4 Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust
      me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust
      me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for
      he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon
      it.<BR />
      5 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise
      upon his sword, and died with him.<BR />
      6 So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and
      all his men, that same day together.<BR />
      7 And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the
      valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that
      the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead,
      they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and
      dwelt in them.<BR />
      8 And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came
      to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen
      in mount Gilboa.<BR />
      9 And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and
      sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish
      it in the house of their idols, and among the people.<BR />
      10 And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they
      fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.<BR />
      11 And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard of that which
      the Philistines had done to Saul;<BR />
      12 All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the
      body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan,
      and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.<BR />
      13 And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at
      Jabesh, and fasted seven days.<BR />

      20 And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then

      21 Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and
      let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not
      them that are in the countries enter thereinto.<BR />
      22 For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which
      are written may be fulfilled.<BR />
      23 But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give
      suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the
      land, and wrath upon this people.<BR />
      24 And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be
      led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden
      down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.<BR />
      25 And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and
      in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity;
      the sea and the waves roaring;<BR />
      26 Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after
      those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of

      the trees;<BR />

      that summer is now nigh at hand.<BR />
      31 So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know
      ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.<BR />
      32 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away,

      18 For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are
      not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed
      in us.<BR />
      19 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the

      but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,<BR />
      21 Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the
      bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children
      of God.<BR />

      1 Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was
      returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had
      abode two days in Ziklag;<BR />
      2 It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man
      came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth
      upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he
      fell to the earth, and did obeisance.<BR />
      3 And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said
      unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.<BR />
      4 And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee,
      tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle,
      and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and
      Jonathan his son are dead also.<BR />
      5 And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest
      thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?<BR />
      6 And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance
      upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo,
      the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.<BR />
      7 And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me.
      And I answered, Here am I.<BR />
      8 And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am
      an Amalekite.<BR />
      9 He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay
      me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole
      in me.<BR />
      10 So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that
      he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown
      that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm,
      and have brought them hither unto my lord.<BR />
      11 Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise
      all the men that were with him:<BR />
      12 And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul,
      and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and
      for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.<BR />
      13 And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art
      thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.<BR />
      14 And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch
      forth thine hand to destroy the LORD'S anointed?<BR />
      15 And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near,
      and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.<BR />
      16 And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy
      mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD'S
      anointed.<BR />

      1 Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called
      the Passover.<BR />
      2 And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill
      him; for they feared the people.<BR />
      3 Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the
      number of the twelve.<BR />
      4 And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and
      captains, how he might betray him unto them.<BR />
      5 And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.<BR />
      6 And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto
      them in the absence of the multitude.<BR />
      7 Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must
      be killed.<BR />
      8 And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover,
      that we may eat.<BR />
      9 And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?<BR />
      10 And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the
      city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water;
      follow him into the house where he entereth in.<BR />
      11 And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master
      saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat
      the passover with my disciples?<BR />
      12 And he shall show you a large upper room furnished: there
      make ready.<BR />
      13 And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they
      made ready the passover.<BR />

      the munition, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy
      power mightily.<BR />
      2 For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the

      and marred their vine branches.<BR />

      12 The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled
      for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens
      with ravin.<BR />
      13 Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I
      will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour

      21 Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there
      be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield

      1 Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies and robbery;
      the prey departeth not;<BR />
      2 The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels,
      and of the prancing horses, and of the jumping chariots.<BR />
      3 The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering
      spear: and there is a multitude of slain, and a great number
      of carcases; and there is none end of their corpses; they stumble
      upon their corpses:<BR />
      4 Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured
      harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through
      her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.<BR />
      5 Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts; and I will
      discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will show the nations
      thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.<BR />
      6 And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile,
      and will set thee as a gazingstock.<BR />
      7 And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee
      shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will
      bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?<BR />
      8 Art thou better than populous No, that was situate among the
      rivers, that had the waters round about it, whose rampart was
      the sea, and her wall was from the sea?<BR />
      9 Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite;
      Put and Lubim were thy helpers.<BR />
      10 Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity: her young
      children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets:
      and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great
      men were bound in chains.<BR />
      11 Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt
      seek strength because of the enemy.<BR />
      12 All thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with the firstripe
      figs: if they be shaken, they shall even fall into the mouth
      of the eater.<BR />
      13 Behold, thy people in the midst of thee are women: the gates
      of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire
      shall devour thy bars.<BR />
      14 Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds:
      go into clay, and tread the mortar, make strong the brickkiln.<BR />
      15 There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee
      off, it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself many
      as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts.<BR />
      16 Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven:
      the cankerworm spoileth, and flieth away.<BR />
      17 Thy crowned are as the locusts, and thy captains as the great
      grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, but when
      the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known
      where they are.<BR />
      18 Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall
      dwell in the dust: thy people is scattered upon the mountains,
      and no man gathereth them.<BR />
      19 There is no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous:
      all that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee:
      for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?<BR />

      22 What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power
      known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted
      to destruction:<BR />
      23 And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the
      vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,<BR />
      24 Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also
      of the Gentiles?<BR />
      30 What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed
      not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even
      the righteousness which is of faith.<BR />

      hath not attained to the law of righteousness.<BR />

      avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.<BR />
      9 And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons

      who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,<BR />
      10 When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to
      have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in
      Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for
      his tidings:<BR />
      11 How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person
      in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require
      his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?<BR />
      12 And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and
      cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the

      let him sell his garment, and buy one.<BR />
      37 For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be

      ye enter not into temptation.<BR />
      41 And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled
      down, and prayed,<BR />

      44 And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat

      45 And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples,
      he found them sleeping for sorrow,<BR />

      2 O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even
      cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save!<BR />
      3 Why dost thou show me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance?
      for spoiling and violence are before me: and there are that raise
      up strife and contention.<BR />
      4 Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth:
      for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong
      judgment proceedeth.<BR />
      12 Art thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One?
      we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment;
      and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.<BR />
      13 Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not
      look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal
      treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth
      the man that is more righteous than he?<BR />
      14 And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things,
      that have no ruler over them?<BR />
      15 They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in
      their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice
      and are glad.<BR />
      16 Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense
      unto their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their
      meat plenteous.<BR />
      17 Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually
      to slay the nations?<BR />
      1 I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and
      will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall

      1 Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is,
      that they might be saved.<BR />
      2 For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not
      according to knowledge.<BR />
      3 For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about
      to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves
      unto the righteousness of God.<BR />
      4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every
      one that believeth.<BR />
      5 For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law,
      That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.<BR />
      6 But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise,
      Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is,
      to bring Christ down from above:)<BR />
      7 Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up
      Christ again from the dead.)<BR />
      8 But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth,
      and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;<BR />
      9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and
      shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the
      dead, thou shalt be saved.<BR />
      10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with
      the mouth confession is made unto salvation.<BR />
      11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall
      not be ashamed.<BR />
      12 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek:
      for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor337784"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">13 For
      whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.<BR />
      14 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?
      and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?
      and how shall they hear without a preacher?<BR />
      15 And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written,
      How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of
      peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!<BR />
      16 But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith,
      Lord, who hath believed our report?<BR />
      17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of
      God.<BR />
      18 But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went
      into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.<BR />
      19 But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will
      provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a
      foolish nation I will anger you.<BR />
      20 But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that
      sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after
      me.<BR />
      21 But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth
      my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.<BR />

      1 Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and
      spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.<BR />
      2 Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he
      that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said
      to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be
      a captain over Israel.<BR />
      3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and
      king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD:
      and they anointed David king over Israel.<BR />
      4 David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
      forty years.<BR />
      5 In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months:
      and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel
      and Judah.<BR />
      6 And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites,
      the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying,
      Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not
      come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither.<BR />
      7 Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is
      the city of David.<BR />
      8 And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter,
      and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, that are
      hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain. Wherefore
      they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.<BR />
      9 So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David.
      And David built round about from Millo and inward.<BR />

      47 And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was
      called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near
      unto Jesus to kiss him.<BR />
      48 But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of
      man with a kiss?<BR />
      49 When they which were about him saw what would follow, they
      said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?<BR />
      50 And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and
      cut off his right ear.<BR />
      51 And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched
      his ear, and healed him.<BR />
      52 Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the
      temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out,
      as against a thief, with swords and staves?<BR />
      53 When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth
      no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of
      darkness.<BR />
      54 Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the
      high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.<BR />
      55 And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall,
      and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.<BR />
      56 But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly
      looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.<BR />
      57 And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.<BR />
      58 And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art
      also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.<BR />
      59 And about the space of one hour after another confidently
      affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for
      he is a Galilaean.<BR />
      60 And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately,
      while he yet spake, the cock crew.<BR />
      61 And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered
      the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock
      crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.<BR />
      62 And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.<BR />

      1 I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For
      I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe
      of Benjamin.<BR />
      2 God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye

      3 Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine
      altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.<BR />
      4 But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved
      to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to
      the image of Baal.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor367612"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">5 Even
      so then at this present time also there is a remnant according

      6 And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace
      is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace:
      otherwise work is no more work.<BR />
      7 What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for;
      but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded<BR />
      8 (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit
      of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they
      should not hear;) unto this day.<BR />
      9 And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap,
      and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:<BR />
      10 Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow
      down their back always.<BR />
      11 I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God
      forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto
      the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.<BR />
      12 Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the
      diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more
      their fulness?<BR />
      13 For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle
      of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:<BR />
      14 If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are
      my flesh, and might save some of them.<BR />
      15 For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the
      world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the
      dead?<BR />
      16 For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and
      if the root be holy, so are the branches.<BR />
      17 And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being

      18 Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest
      not the root, but the root thee.<BR />
      19 Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might
      be grafted in.<BR />
      20 Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest
      by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:<BR />

      between the cherubims.<BR />
      3 And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it
      out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and
      Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.<BR />
      4 And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was
      at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before
      the ark.<BR />
      5 And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD
      on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps,
      and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals.<BR />
      6 And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth
      his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen
      shook it.<BR />
      7 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God
      smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of
      God.<BR />
      8 And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach
      upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perez-uzzah to
      this day.<BR />
      9 And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall

      10 So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into

      he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that
      time.<BR />
      8 And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was
      desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many
      things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by
      him.<BR />
      9 Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered
      him nothing.<BR />
      10 And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused
      him.<BR />
      11 And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked
      him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to
      Pilate.<BR />

      Habakkuk 3:2-6, 10-13, 18-19a </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      2 O LORD, I have heard thy speech, and was afraid: O LORD, revive
      thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years
      make known; in wrath remember mercy.<BR />
      3 God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah.
      His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his
      praise.<BR />
      4 And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out
      of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power.<BR />
      5 Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth
      at his feet.<BR />
      6 He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder
      the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the
      perpetual hills did bow: his ways are everlasting.<BR />
      10 The mountains saw thee, and they trembled: the overflowing
      of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, and lifted
      up his hands on high.<BR />
      11 The sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the light
      of thine arrows they went, and at the shining of thy glittering
      spear.<BR />
      12 Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst
      thresh the heathen in anger.<BR />
      13 Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for
      salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of
      the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the
      neck. Selah.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor391407"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">18 Yet
      I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation.<BR />

      LORD God is my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds'

      Lesson<BR />
      Romans 11:22-36 </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      22 Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them
      which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue
      in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.<BR />
      23 And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall
      be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.<BR />
      24 For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by
      nature, and wert grafted contrary to nature into a good olive
      tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches,
      be grafted into their own olive tree?<BR />
      25 For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this
      mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness
      in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles
      be come in.<BR />
      26 And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There
      shall come out of Zion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness
      from Jacob:<BR />
      27 For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away
      their sins.<BR />
      28 As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes:
      but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers'
      sakes.<BR />
      29 For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.<BR />
      30 For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now
      obtained mercy through their unbelief:<BR />
      31 Even so have these also now not believed, that through your
      mercy they also may obtain mercy.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor396003"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">32 For
      God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy
      upon all.<BR />
      33 O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge
      of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past
      finding out!<BR />
      34 For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been
      his counsellor?<BR />
      35 Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed
      unto him again?<BR />
      36 For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to
      whom be glory for ever. Amen.<BR />
