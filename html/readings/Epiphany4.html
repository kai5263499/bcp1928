      The spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath
      anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent
      me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives,
      and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;<BR />
      2 To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of
      vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;<BR />
      3 To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them
      beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of
      praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called
      trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might
      be glorified.<BR />
      4 And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the
      former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the
      desolations of many generations.<BR />
      5 And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons
      of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.<BR />
      6 But ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD: men shall call
      you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the
      Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.<BR />
      7 For your shame ye shall have double; and for confusion they
      shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they
      shall possess the double: everlasting joy shall be unto them.<BR />
      8 For I the LORD love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt offering;
      and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting
      covenant with them.<BR />
      9 And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their
      offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge
      them, that they are the seed which the LORD hath blessed.<BR />
      10 I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful
      in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation,
      he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom
      decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself
      with her jewels.<BR />
      11 For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden
      causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the
      Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth
      before all the nations.<BR />

      16 And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and,
      as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath
      day, and stood up for to read.<BR />
      17 And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias.
      And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it
      was written,<BR />
      18 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed
      me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal
      the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and
      recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that
      are bruised,<BR />
      19 To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.<BR />
      20 And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister,
      and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue
      were fastened on him.<BR />
      21 And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture
      fulfilled in your ears.<BR />
      22 And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words
      which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this
      Joseph's son?<BR />
      23 And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this proverb,
      Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum,
      do also here in thy country.<BR />
      24 And he said, Verily, I say unto you, No prophet is accepted
      in his own country.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor205826"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">25 But
      I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days
      of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months,
      when great famine was throughout all the land;<BR />
      26 But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a
      city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow.<BR />
      27 And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the
      prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian.<BR />
      28 And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things,
      were filled with wrath,<BR />
      29 And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto
      the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they
      might cast him down headlong.<BR />
      30 But he passing through the midst of them went his way,<BR />
      31 And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught
      them on the sabbath days.<BR />

      20 Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that
      are escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up
      the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot
      save.<BR />
      21 Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together:
      who hath declared this from ancient time? who hath told it from
      that time? have not I the LORD? and there is no God else beside
      me; a just God and a Saviour; there is none beside me.<BR />

      Romans 10</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is,
      that they might be saved.<BR />
      2 For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not
      according to knowledge.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor308257"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">3 For
      they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to
      establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves
      unto the righteousness of God.<BR />
      4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every
      one that believeth.<BR />
      5 For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law,
      That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.<BR />
      6 But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise,
      Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is,
      to bring Christ down from above:)<BR />
      7 Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up
      Christ again from the dead.)<BR />
      8 But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth,
      and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;<BR />
      9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and
      shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the
      dead, thou shalt be saved.<BR />
      10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with
      the mouth confession is made unto salvation.<BR />
      11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall
      not be ashamed.<BR />
      12 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek:
      for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor316658"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">13 For
      whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.<BR />
      14 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?
      and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?
      and how shall they hear without a preacher?<BR />
      15 And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written,
      How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of
      peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!<BR />
      16 But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith,
      Lord, who hath believed our report?<BR />
      17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of
      God.<BR />
      18 But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went
      into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.<BR />
      19 But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will
      provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a
      foolish nation I will anger you.<BR />
      20 But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that
      sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after
      me.<BR />
      21 But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth
      my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.<BR />

      41 The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread

      44 No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me

      that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life

      52 The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can
      this man give us his flesh to eat?<BR />

      you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall

      they may live.<BR />

      12 Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord

      22 And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains

      be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two
      kingdoms any more at all:<BR />
      23 Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols,
      nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions:
      but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces, wherein
      they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my
      people, and I will be their God.<BR />
      24 And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all
      shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments,
      and observe my statutes, and do them.<BR />
      25 And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob
      my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell
      therein, even they, and their children, and their children's
