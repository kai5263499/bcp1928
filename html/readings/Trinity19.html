      Lesson<BR />
      Job 24:1-17 </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they
      that know him not see his days?<BR />
      2 Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks,
      and feed thereof.<BR />
      3 They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's
      ox for a pledge.<BR />
      4 They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide
      themselves together.<BR />
      5 Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their
      work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food
      for them and for their children.<BR />
      6 They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather
      the vintage of the wicked.<BR />
      7 They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have
      no covering in the cold.<BR />
      8 They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace
      the rock for want of a shelter.<BR />
      9 They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge
      of the poor.<BR />
      10 They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take
      away the sheaf from the hungry;<BR />
      11 Which make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses,
      and suffer thirst.<BR />
      12 Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded
      crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.<BR />
      13 They are of those that rebel against the light; they know
      not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.<BR />
      14 The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy,
      and in the night is as a thief.<BR />
      15 The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying,
      No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.<BR />
      16 In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked
      for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.<BR />
      17 For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if
      one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.<BR />

      But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:<BR />
      2 That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith,
      in charity, in patience.<BR />
      3 The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh
      holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers
      of good things;<BR />
      4 That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their
      husbands, to love their children,<BR />
      5 To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to
      their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.<BR />
      6 Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.<BR />

      to please them well in all things; not answering again;<BR />
      10 Not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may
      adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.<BR />

      7 How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken
      me, and sworn by them that are no gods: when I had fed them to
      the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves
      by troops in the harlots' houses.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor374966"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">8 They
      were as fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after his
      neighbour's wife.<BR />
      9 Shall I not visit for these things? saith the LORD: and shall
      not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?<BR />
      10 Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full
      end: take away her battlements; for they are not the LORD'S.<BR />
      11 For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt
      very treacherously against me, saith the LORD.<BR />
      12 They have belied the LORD, and said, It is not he; neither
      shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine:<BR />
      13 And the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in
      them: thus shall it be done unto them.<BR />
      14 Wherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, Because ye speak
      this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and
      this people wood, and it shall devour them.<BR />
      15 Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel,
      saith the LORD: it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation,
      a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest
      what they say.<BR />
      16 Their quiver is as an open sepulchre, they are all mighty
      men.<BR />
      17 And they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread, which
      thy sons and thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy
      flocks and thine herds: they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig
      trees: they shall impoverish thy fenced cities, wherein thou
      trustedst, with the sword.<BR />
      18 Nevertheless in those days, saith the LORD, I will not make
      a full end with you.<BR />
      19 And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth
      the LORD our God all these things unto us? then shalt thou answer
      them, Like as ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods in
      your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not
      yours.<BR />

      2 Corinthians 13</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of
      two or three witnesses shall every word be established.<BR />
      2 I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present,
      the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore
      have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will
      not spare:<BR />
      3 Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward
      is not weak, but is mighty in you.<BR />
      4 For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth
      by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall
      live with him by the power of God toward you.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor380800"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">5 Examine
      yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves.
      Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you,
      except ye be reprobates?<BR />
      6 But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.<BR />
      7 Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear
      approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though
      we be as reprobates.<BR />
      8 For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.<BR />
      9 For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this
      also we wish, even your perfection.<BR />
      10 Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present
      I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord
      hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.<BR />
      11 Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort,
      be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace
      shall be with you.<BR />
      12 Greet one another with an holy kiss.<BR />
      13 All the saints salute you.<BR />
      14 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and
      the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.<BR />

      11 And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who
      were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto
      them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent
      unto them.<BR />
      12 They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.<BR />
      13 And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before
      him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against
      Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme
      God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city,
      and stoned him with stones, that he died.<BR />
      14 Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is
      dead.<BR />
      15 And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned,
      and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession
      of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to
      give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.<BR />
      16 And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead,
      that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite,
      to take possession of it.<BR />
      17 And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,<BR />
      18 Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria:
      behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down
      to possess it.<BR />
      19 And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD,
      Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak
      unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place where dogs
      licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.<BR />
      20 And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?
      And he answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself
      to work evil in the sight of the LORD.<BR />
      21 Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy
      posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against
      the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,<BR />
      22 And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son
      of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for
      the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and
      made Israel to sin.<BR />

      such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and

      13 When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked
      his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man
      am?<BR />
      14 And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some,
      Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor519572"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">15 He
      saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?<BR />
      16 And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the
      Son of the living God.<BR />
      17 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon
      Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee,
      but my Father which is in heaven.<BR />
      18 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this
      rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not
      prevail against it.<BR />
      19 And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven:
      and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven:
      and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.<BR />
      20 Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man
      that he was Jesus the Christ.<BR />
      21 From that time forth began Jesus to show unto his disciples,
      how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of
      the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and
      be raised again the third day.<BR />
      22 Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it
      far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.<BR />

      he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou
      art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that
      be of God, but those that be of men.<BR />
      24 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after
      me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.<BR />
      25 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever
      will lose his life for my sake shall find it.<BR />
      26 For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world,
      and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for

      1 And they continued three years without war between Syria and
      Israel.<BR />
      2 And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the
      king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.<BR />
      3 And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that
      Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out
      of the hand of the king of Syria?<BR />
      4 And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle
      to Ramoth-gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel,
      I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.<BR />
      5 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray
      thee, at the word of the LORD today.<BR />
      6 Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about
      four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead
      to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the
      Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king.<BR />
      7 And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD
      besides, that we might inquire of him?<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor528654"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">8 And
      the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man,
      Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may inquire of the LORD:
      but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me,
      but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.<BR />
      9 Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten
      hither Micaiah the son of Imlah.<BR />
      10 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat
      each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place
      in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets
      prophesied before them.<BR />
      11 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron:
      and he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push
      the Syrians, until thou have consumed them.<BR />
      12 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead,
      and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the king's hand.<BR />

      13 Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let

      5 While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them:

      13 And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto
      him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good
      unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like
      the word of one of them, and speak that which is good.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor556231"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">14 And
      Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto me,
      that will I speak.<BR />
      15 So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah,
      shall we go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear?
      And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver
      it into the hand of the king.<BR />
      16 And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure
      thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the
      name of the LORD?<BR />
      17 And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as
      sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have
      no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.<BR />
      18 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell
      thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?<BR />
      19 And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw
      the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing
      by him on his right hand and on his left.<BR />
      20 And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go
      up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said on this manner, and
      another said on that manner.<BR />
      21 And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD,
      and said, I will persuade him.<BR />
      22 And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will
      go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his
      prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also:
      go forth, and do so.<BR />
      23 Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in
      the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken
      evil concerning thee.<BR />
      24 But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah
      on the cheek, and said, Which way went the spirit of the LORD
      from me to speak unto thee?<BR />
      25 And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when
      thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.<BR />
      26 And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back
      unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;<BR />
      27 And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison,
      and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction,
      until I come in peace.<BR />
      28 And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD
      hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every
      one of you.<BR />

      And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.<BR />
      31 But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains
      that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small

      32 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw
      Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel.

      out.<BR />
      33 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived
      that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from
      pursuing him.<BR />
      34 And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king
      of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said
      unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me
      out of the host; for I am wounded.<BR />
      35 And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed
      up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and
      the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.<BR />
      36 And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the
      going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every
      man to his own country.<BR />
      37 So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried
      the king in Samaria.<BR />
      38 And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the

      that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;<BR />
      13 Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious:
      but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.<BR />

      and love which is in Christ Jesus.<BR />

      2 And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber
      that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and
      said unto them, Go, inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron whether
      I shall recover of this disease.<BR />
      3 But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise,
      go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say
      unto them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that
      ye go to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron?<BR />
      4 Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down
      from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.
      And Elijah departed.<BR />
      5 And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto
      them, Why are ye now turned back?<BR />
      6 And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and
      said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and
      say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Is it not because there is
      not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to inquire of Baal-zebub
      the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that
      bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.<BR />
      7 And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came
      up to meet you, and told you these words?<BR />
      8 And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a
      girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah
      the Tishbite.<BR />

      2 And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the
      LORD hath sent me to Beth-el. And Elisha said unto him, As the
      LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So
      they went down to Beth-el.<BR />
      3 And the sons of the prophets that were at Beth-el came forth
      to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will
      take away thy master from thy head today? And he said, Yea, I
      know it; hold ye your peace.<BR />
      4 And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee;
      for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD
      liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they

      6 And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the
      LORD hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD liveth,
      and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went
      on.<BR />
      7 And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to
      view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.<BR />
      8 And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote
      the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that
      they two went over on dry ground.<BR />
      9 And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah
      said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken
      away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion
      of thy spirit be upon me.<BR />
      10 And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if
      thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee;
      but if not, it shall not be so.<BR />
      11 And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that,
      behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire,
      and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind
      into heaven.<BR />
      12 And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the
      chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no
      more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two
      pieces.<BR />
      13 He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and
      went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;<BR />
      14 And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote
      the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and when
      he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither:
      and Elisha went over.<BR />
      15 And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho
      saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha.
      And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground
      before him.<BR />

      1 This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop,
      he desireth a good work.<BR />
      2 A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant,
      sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;<BR />
      3 Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre;
      but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;<BR />
      4 One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in
      subjection with all gravity;<BR />
      5 (For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall
      he take care of the church of God?)<BR />
      6 Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into
      the condemnation of the devil.<BR />
      7 Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without;
      lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.<BR />
      8 Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not
      given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;<BR />
      9 Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.<BR />
      10 And let these also first be proved; then let them use the
      office of a deacon, being found blameless.<BR />
      11 Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober,
      faithful in all things.<BR />
      12 Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their
      children and their own houses well.<BR />
      13 For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase
      to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith
      which is in Christ Jesus.<BR />

      Lesson<BR />
      Job 42:1-9</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Then Job answered the LORD, and said,<BR />
      2 I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought
      can be withholden from thee.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor662394"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">3 Who
      is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I
      uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which
      I knew not.<BR />
      4 Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee,
      and declare thou unto me.<BR />
      5 I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine
      eye seeth thee.<BR />
      6 Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.<BR />
      7 And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto
      Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled
      against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken
      of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.<BR />
      8 Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams,
      and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt
      offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will
      I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have
      not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.<BR />
      9 So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the
      Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them:
      the LORD also accepted Job.<BR />

      Lesson<BR />
      Matthew 19:1-15</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings,
      he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea
      beyond Jordan;<BR />
      2 And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.<BR />
      3 The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying
      unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every
      cause?<BR />
      4 And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that
      he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,<BR />
      5 And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother,
      and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?<BR />
      6 Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore
      God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.<BR />
      7 They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing
      of divorcement, and to put her away?<BR />
      8 He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts
      suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it
      was not so.<BR />
      9 And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except
      it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery:
      and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.<BR />
      10 His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with
      his wife, it is not good to marry.<BR />
      11 But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying,
      save they to whom it is given.<BR />
      12 For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their
      mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs
      of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs
      for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive
      it, let him receive it.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor666010"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">13 Then
      were there brought unto him little children, that he should put
      his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.<BR />
      14 But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not,
      to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.<BR />
      15 And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.<BR />
