      Your words have been stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye
      say, What have we spoken so much against thee?<BR />
      14 Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is
      it that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully
      before the LORD of hosts?<BR />
      15 And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness
      are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.<BR />
      16 Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another:
      and the LORD hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance
      was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that
      thought upon his name.<BR />
      17 And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day
      when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth
      his own son that serveth him.<BR />
      18 Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and
      the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth
      him not.<BR />

      17 And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even
      the devils are subject unto us through thy name.<BR />
      18 And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from
      heaven.<BR />
      19 Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions,
      and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any
      means hurt you.<BR />
      20 Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are
      subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are
      written in heaven.<BR />
      21 In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee,
      O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these
      things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto
      babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.<BR />
      22 All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth
      who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the
      Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.<BR />

      Jude 1-4,17-25</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to
      them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in
      Jesus Christ, and called:<BR />
      2 Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.<BR />
      3 Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the
      common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and
      exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which
      was once delivered unto the saints.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor806550"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">4 For
      there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old
      ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace
      of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God,
      and our Lord Jesus Christ.<BR />
      17 But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before
      of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;<BR />
      18 How that they told you there should be mockers in the last
      time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.<BR />
      19 These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not
      the Spirit.<BR />
      20 But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy
      faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,<BR />
      21 Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy
      of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.<BR />
      22 And of some have compassion, making a difference:<BR />
      23 And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating
      even the garment spotted by the flesh.<BR />
      24 Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to
      present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding
      joy,<BR />
      25 To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion
      and power, both now and ever. Amen.<BR />

      1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,<BR />

      am holy.<BR />
      9 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly

      13 Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob him: the
      wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night
      until the morning.<BR />
      14 Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before
      the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD.<BR />
      15 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not
      respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the
      mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.<BR />
      16 Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people:
      neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour:
      I am the LORD.<BR />
      17 Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt
      in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.<BR />
      18 Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children
      of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself:
      I am the LORD.<BR />

      11 And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked
      him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto
      him, Thou sayest.<BR />
      12 And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he
      answered nothing.<BR />
      13 Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things
      they witness against thee?<BR />
      14 And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor
      marvelled greatly.<BR />
      15 Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the
      people a prisoner, whom they would.<BR />
      16 And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.<BR />
      17 Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto
      them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus
      which is called Christ?<BR />
      18 For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.<BR />
      19 When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto
      him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for
      I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.<BR />
      20 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that
      they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.<BR />
      21 The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain
      will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.<BR />
      22 Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which
      is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.<BR />
      23 And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they
      cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.<BR />
      24 When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather
      a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before
      the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just
      person: see ye to it.<BR />

      27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common
      hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.<BR />
      28 And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.<BR />
      29 And when they had plaited a crown of thorns, they put it upon
      his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee
      before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!<BR />
      30 And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on
      the head.<BR />
      31 And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off
      from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to
      crucify him.<BR />
      32 And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by
      name: him they compelled to bear his cross.<BR />
      33 And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that
      is to say, a place of a skull,<BR />
      34 They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when
      he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.<BR />
      35 And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots:
      that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They
      parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast
      lots.<BR />

      39 And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,<BR />
      40 And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest
      it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come
      down from the cross.<BR />
      41 Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes
      and elders, said,<BR />
      42 He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King
      of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will

      27 Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of
      Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I
      may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with
      one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;<BR />
      28 And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to
      them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation,
      and that of God.<BR />
      29 For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only
      to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;<BR />
      30 Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear
      to be in me.<BR />
      1 If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort
      of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,<BR />
      2 Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love,
      being of one accord, of one mind.<BR />
      3 Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness
      of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.<BR />
      4 Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on
      the things of others.<BR />
      5 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:<BR />
      6 Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be
      equal with God:<BR />
      7 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form
      of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:<BR />
      8 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and
      became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.<BR />
      9 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a
      name which is above every name:<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor1061677"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">10 That
      at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven,
      and things in earth, and things under the earth;<BR />
      11 And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is
      Lord, to the glory of God the Father.<BR />
      12 Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in
      my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your
      own salvation with fear and trembling.<BR />
      13 For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do
      of his good pleasure.<BR />
      14 Do all things without murmurings and disputings:<BR />
      15 That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without
      rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among
      whom ye shine as lights in the world;<BR />
      16 Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the
      day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured
      in vain.<BR />
      17 Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of
      your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.<BR />

      57 When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea,
      named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:<BR />
      58 He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate
      commanded the body to be delivered.<BR />
      59 And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean
      linen cloth,<BR />
      60 And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in
      the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre,
      and departed.<BR />
      61 And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting
      over against the sepulchre.<BR />
      62 Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation,
      the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,<BR />
      63 Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he
      was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.<BR />
      64 Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the
      third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away,
      and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last
      error shall be worse than the first.<BR />
      65 Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make
      it as sure as ye can.<BR />
      66 So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone,
      and setting a watch.<BR />

      6 Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness

      the righteousness which is of God by faith:<BR />

      13 Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this
      one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and
      reaching forth unto those things which are before,<BR />
      14 I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling
      of God in Christ Jesus.<BR />
      15 Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and
      if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even

      16 Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk
      by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.<BR />
      17 Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which
      walk so as ye have us for an example.<BR />
      18 (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell
      you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:<BR />
      19 Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose
      glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)<BR />
      20 For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look
      for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:<BR />
      21 Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like

      able even to subdue all things unto himself.<BR />

      The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst

      Matthew 28:11-20</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      11 Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into
      the city, and showed unto the chief priests all the things that
      were done.<BR />
      12 And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken
      counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,<BR />
      13 Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him
      away while we slept.<BR />
      14 And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade
      him, and secure you.<BR />
      15 So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this
      saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.<BR />
      16 Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain
      where Jesus had appointed them.<BR />
      17 And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.<BR />
      18 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given
      unto me in heaven and in earth.<BR />
      19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in
      the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:<BR />

      lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen.<BR />
