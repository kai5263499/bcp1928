      Lesson<BR />
      Jeremiah 29:1,4-14 </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet
      sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were
      carried away captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets,
      and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive
      from Jerusalem to Babylon;<BR />
      4 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that
      are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away
      from Jerusalem unto Babylon;<BR />
      5 Build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and
      eat the fruit of them;<BR />
      6 Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives
      for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they
      may bear sons and daughters; that ye may be increased there,
      and not diminished.<BR />
      7 And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to
      be carried away captives, and pray unto the LORD for it: for
      in the peace thereof shall ye have peace.<BR />
      8 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not
      your prophets and your diviners, that be in the midst of you,
      deceive you, neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to
      be dreamed.<BR />
      9 For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent
      them, saith the LORD.<BR />
      10 For thus saith the LORD, That after seventy years be accomplished
      at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word toward
      you, in causing you to return to this place.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor1518814"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">11 For
      I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD,
      thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.<BR />
      12 Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto
      me, and I will hearken unto you.<BR />
      13 And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for
      me with all your heart.<BR />
      14 And I will be found of you, saith the LORD: and I will turn
      away your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations,
      and from all the places whither I have driven you, saith the
      LORD; and I will bring you again into the place whence I caused
      you to be carried away captive.<BR />

      Titus 3:1-8 </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers,
      to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor1532927"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">2 To
      speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, showing
      all meekness unto all men.<BR />
      3 For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient,
      deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice
      and envy, hateful, and hating one another.<BR />
      4 But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward
      man appeared,<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor1533905"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">5 Not
      by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to
      his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing
      of the Holy Ghost;<BR />
      6 Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;<BR />
      7 That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs
      according to the hope of eternal life.<BR />
      8 This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou
      affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might
      be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and
      profitable unto men.<BR />

      8 Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings
      without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might
      reign with you.<BR />
      9 For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as
      it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto
      the world, and to angels, and to men.<BR />
      10 We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ;
      we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are
      despised.<BR />
      11 Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and
      are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;<BR />
      12 And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we
      bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:<BR />
      13 Being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the
      world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day.<BR />
      14 I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons
      I warn you.<BR />

      Jeremiah 35:1-11</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the days
      of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,<BR />
      2 Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and
      bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers,
      and give them wine to drink.<BR />
      3 Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah,
      and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the
      Rechabites;<BR />
      4 And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber
      of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which
      was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber
      of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door:<BR />
      5 And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots
      full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine.<BR />
      6 But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of
      Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine,
      neither ye, nor your sons for ever:<BR />
      7 Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard,
      nor have any: but all your days ye shall dwell in tents; that
      ye may live many days in the land where ye be strangers.<BR />
      8 Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab
      our father in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all
      our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;<BR />
      9 Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard,
      nor field, nor seed:<BR />
      10 But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according
      to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.<BR />
      11 But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came
      up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem
      for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army
      of the Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem.<BR />

      1 And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings,
      he said unto his disciples,<BR />
      2 Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and
      the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.<BR />
      3 Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes,
      and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest,
      who was called Caiaphas,<BR />
      4 And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtlety, and kill
      him.<BR />
      5 But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar
      among the people.<BR />
      6 Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor1597623"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">7 There
      came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious
      ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.<BR />
      8 But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying,
      To what purpose is this waste?<BR />
      9 For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given
      to the poor.<BR />
      10 When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye
      the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.<BR />
      11 For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.<BR />
      12 For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she
      did it for my burial.<BR />
      13 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached

      receive instruction to hearken to my words? saith the LORD.<BR />
      14 The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded
      his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day
      they drink none, but obey their father's commandment: notwithstanding
      I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye hearkened
      not unto me.<BR />
      15 I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising
      up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from
      his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods
      to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given
      to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear,
      nor hearkened unto me.<BR />
      16 Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed
      the commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but
      this people hath not hearkened unto me:<BR />
      17 Therefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel;
      Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants
      of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them:
      because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and
      I have called unto them, but they have not answered.<BR />
      18 And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith
      the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have obeyed
      the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts,
      and done according unto all that he hath commanded you:<BR />
      19 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
      Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before

      1 And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son
      of Josiah king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from
      the LORD, saying,<BR />
      2 Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words
      that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah,
      and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee,
      from the days of Josiah, even unto this day.<BR />
      3 It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which
      I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from
      his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.<BR />
      4 Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote
      from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD, which he
      had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.<BR />
      5 And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot
      go into the house of the LORD:<BR />
      6 Therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written
      from my mouth, the words of the LORD in the ears of the people
      in the LORD'S house upon the fasting day: and also thou shalt
      read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities.<BR />
      7 It may be they will present their supplication before the LORD,
      and will return every one from his evil way: for great is the
      anger and the fury that the LORD hath pronounced against this
      people.<BR />
      8 And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah
      the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the
      LORD in the LORD'S house.<BR />

      1 All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye
      observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and
      possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers.<BR />
      2 And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God
      led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee,
      and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou
      wouldest keep his commandments, or no.<BR />
      3 And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee
      with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know;
      that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread
      only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the
      LORD doth man live.<BR />
      4 Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell,
      these forty years.<BR />
      5 Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth
      his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.<BR />
      6 Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy
      God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.<BR />

      23 And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four

      that was on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the
      fire that was on the hearth.<BR />
      24 Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither
      the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.<BR />

      59 Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought
      false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;<BR />
      60 But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet

      said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell
      us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.<BR />
      64 Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto
      you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right

      ye have heard his blasphemy.<BR />

      7 Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy
      God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst
      depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place,
      ye have been rebellious against the LORD.<BR />
      8 Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD
      was angry with you to have destroyed you.<BR />
      9 When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of
      stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with
      you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I
      neither did eat bread nor drink water:<BR />
      10 And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written
      with the finger of God; and on them was written according to
      all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out
      of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.<BR />
      11 And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights,
      that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables
      of the covenant.<BR />
      12 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from
      hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt
      have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out
      of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten

      14 Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their
      name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier
      and greater than they.<BR />
      15 So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned
      with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two
      hands.<BR />
      16 And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD
      your God, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside
      quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you.<BR />
      17 And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands,
      and brake them before your eyes.<BR />
      25 Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights,
      as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would
      destroy you.<BR />
      26 I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy
      not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed
      through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt
      with a mighty hand.<BR />
      27 Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not

      blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.<BR />
      5 And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed,
      and went and hanged himself.<BR />
      6 And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It
      is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is
      the price of blood.<BR />
      7 And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field,
      to bury strangers in.<BR />
      8 Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this
      day.<BR />
      9 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet,
      saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price
      of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did
      value;<BR />
      10 And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed
      me.<BR />
