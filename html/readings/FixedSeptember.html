      9 Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly,
      because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD:
      and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.<BR />
      10 Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation:
      and David said, Blessed be thou, LORD God of Israel our father,
      for ever and ever.<BR />
      11 Thine, O LORD, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory,
      and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven
      and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and
      thou art exalted as head above all.<BR />
      12 Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over
      all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand
      it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.<BR />
      13 Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious
      name.<BR />
      14 But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able
      to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of
      thee, and of thine own have we given thee.<BR />
      15 For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were
      all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there
      is none abiding.<BR />
      16 O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build
      thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is
      all thine own.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor642346"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">17 I
      know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure
      in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I
      have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen
      with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly
      unto thee.<BR />

      Romans 10:1-15</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is,
      that they might be saved.<BR />
      2 For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not
      according to knowledge.<BR />
      3 For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about
      to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves
      unto the righteousness of God.<BR />
      4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every
      one that believeth.<BR />
      5 For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law,
      That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.<BR />
      6 But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise,
      Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is,
      to bring Christ down from above:)<BR />
      7 Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up
      Christ again from the dead.)<BR />
      8 But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth,
      and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;<BR />
      9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and
      shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the
      dead, thou shalt be saved.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor649478"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">10 For
      with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the
      mouth confession is made unto salvation.<BR />
      11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall
      not be ashamed.<BR />
      12 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek:
      for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.<BR />
      13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be
      saved.<BR />
      14 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?
      and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?
      and how shall they hear without a preacher?<BR />
      15 And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written,
      How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of
      peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!<BR />

      15 And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness
      of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be king over
      Syria:<BR />
      16 And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over

      he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who
      was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with
      the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon
      him.<BR />
      20 And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let
      me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will
      follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have
      I done to thee?<BR />
      21 And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and
      slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the
      oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose,

      16 And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what
      good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?<BR />
      17 And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none
      good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life,
      keep the commandments.<BR />
      18 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder,
      Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt
      not bear false witness,<BR />
      19 Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy
      neighbour as thyself.<BR />
      20 The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept
      from my youth up: what lack I yet?<BR />
      21 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell
      that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure
      in heaven: and come and follow me.<BR />
      22 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful:
      for he had great possessions.<BR />
      23 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you,
      That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.<BR />
      24 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through
      the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom
      of God.<BR />
      25 When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed,
      saying, Who then can be saved?<BR />
      26 But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is
      impossible; but with God all things are possible.<BR />
      27 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken
      all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?<BR />
      28 And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which
      have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall
      sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve
      thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.<BR />
      29 And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters,
      or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my
      name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit
      everlasting life.<BR />
      30 But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall
      be first.<BR />

      Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless,
      and him that had none to help him.<BR />
      13 The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me:
      and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.<BR />
      14 I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was
      as a robe and a diadem.<BR />
      15 I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.<BR />
      16 I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not
      I searched out.<BR />
      17 And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil
      out of his teeth.<BR />
      18 Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply
      my days as the sand.<BR />
      19 My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all
      night upon my branch.<BR />
      20 My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.<BR />
      21 Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.<BR />
      22 After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped
      upon them.<BR />
      23 And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their
      mouth wide as for the latter rain.<BR />
      24 If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light
      of my countenance they cast not down.<BR />
      25 I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king
      in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners.<BR />

      1 And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a
      book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.<BR />
      2 And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who
      is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?<BR />
      3 And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth,
      was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.<BR />
      4 And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and
      to read the book, neither to look thereon.<BR />
      5 And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the
      Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed
      to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.<BR />
      6 And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the
      four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as
      it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are
      the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.<BR />
      7 And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him
      that sat upon the throne.<BR />
      8 And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and
      twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of
      them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers
      of saints.<BR />
      9 And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the
      book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and
      hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and
      tongue, and people, and nation;<BR />
      10 And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall
      reign on the earth.<BR />

      the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them
      was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;<BR />
      12 Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain
      to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour,
      and glory, and blessing.<BR />
      13 And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and
      under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are
      in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and
      power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the

      him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of
      thy hands:<BR />
      8 Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For
      in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that
      is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under
      him.<BR />

      we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for
      the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he
      by the grace of God should taste death for every man.<BR />
      10 For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are
      all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain
      of their salvation perfect through sufferings.<BR />

      8 Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel
      with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be
      my camp.<BR />
      9 And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware
      that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are
      come down.<BR />
      10 And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of
      God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not
      once nor twice.<BR />
      11 Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled
      for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them,
      Will ye not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?<BR />
      12 And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha,
      the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the
      words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.<BR />
      13 And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch
      him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.<BR />
      14 Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great
      host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.<BR />
      15 And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and
      gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses
      and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master!
      how shall we do?<BR />
      16 And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more
      than they that be with them.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor734558"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">17 And
      Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that
      he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and
      he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots
      of fire round about Elisha.<BR />

      Acts 12:1-11</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands
      to vex certain of the church.<BR />
      2 And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.<BR />
      3 And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further
      to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)<BR />
      4 And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and
      delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending
      after Easter to bring him forth to the people.<BR />
      5 Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without
      ceasing of the church unto God for him.<BR />
      6 And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night
      Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains:
      and the keepers before the door kept the prison.<BR />
      7 And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light
      shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised
      him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from
      his hands.<BR />
      8 And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy
      sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment
      about thee, and follow me.<BR />
      9 And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was
      true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.<BR />
      10 When they were past the first and the second ward, they came
      unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to
      them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through
      one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.<BR />
      11 And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of
      a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered
      me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of
      the people of the Jews.<BR />
