      Proverbs 4:7-18</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      7 Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with
      all thy getting get understanding.<BR />
      8 Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee
      to honour, when thou dost embrace her.<BR />
      9 She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown
      of glory shall she deliver to thee.<BR />
      10 Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy
      life shall be many.<BR />
      11 I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in
      right paths.<BR />
      12 When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when
      thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.<BR />
      13 Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for
      she is thy life.<BR />
      14 Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way
      of evil men.<BR />
      15 Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.<BR />
      16 For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their
      sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.<BR />
      17 For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of
      violence.<BR />

      John 12:20-26</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      20 And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship
      at the feast:<BR />
      21 The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida
      of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.<BR />
      22 Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip
      tell Jesus.<BR />
      23 And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the
      Son of man should be glorified.<BR />
      24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall
      into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it
      bringeth forth much fruit.<BR />

      shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father
      honour.<BR />

      3 Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even
      to his seat!<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor187039"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">4 I would
      order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.<BR />
      5 I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand
      what he would say unto me.<BR />
      6 Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would
      put strength in me.<BR />
      7 There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be
      delivered for ever from my judge.<BR />
      8 Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but
      I cannot perceive him:<BR />
      9 On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him:
      he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:<BR />
      10 But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me,
      I shall come forth as gold.<BR />
      11 My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not
      declined.<BR />
      12 Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips;
      I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary
      food.<BR />

      43 The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth
      Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.<BR />
      44 Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.<BR />
      45 Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found
      him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus
      of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.<BR />
      46 And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come
      out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.<BR />
      47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold
      an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!<BR />
      48 Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered
      and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou
      wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.<BR />
      49 Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the
      Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.<BR />
      50 Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee,
      I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see
      greater things than these.<BR />
      51 And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter
      ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and
      descending upon the Son of man.<BR />

      Isaiah 30:18-21<BR />

      And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto
      you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy
      upon you: for the LORD is a God of judgment: blessed are all
      they that wait for him.<BR />
      19 For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt
      weep no more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice
      of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee.<BR />
      20 And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the
      water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into
      a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers:<BR />
      21 And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This
      is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and
      when ye turn to the left.<BR />

      1 These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven,
      and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy
      Son also may glorify thee:<BR />
      2 As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should
      give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.<BR />

      5 And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with
      the glory which I had with thee before the world was.<BR />
      6 I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me
      out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and
      they have kept thy word.<BR />
      7 Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given
      me are of thee.<BR />
      8 For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me;

      out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.</FONT></P>
