      2 The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light:
      they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them
      hath the light shined.<BR />
      3 Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy:
      they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as
      men rejoice when they divide the spoil.<BR />
      4 For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff
      of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian.<BR />

      every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments
      rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire.<BR />
      6 For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the
      government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be
      called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting
      Father, The Prince of Peace.<BR />
      7 Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be
      no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order
      it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth
      even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this.<BR />

      1 And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree
      from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.<BR />
      2 (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor
      of Syria.)<BR />
      3 And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.<BR />
      4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth,
      into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem;
      (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)<BR />
      5 To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.<BR />
      6 And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished
      that she should be delivered.<BR />
      7 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in
      swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was
      no room for them in the inn.<BR />
      8 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the
      field, keeping watch over their flock by night.<BR />
      9 And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory
      of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.<BR />
      10 And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring
      you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.<BR />
      11 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour,
      which is Christ the Lord.<BR />
      12 And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe
      wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.<BR />
      13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly
      host praising God, and saying,<BR />
      14 Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will
      toward men.<BR />
      15 And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them
      into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go
      even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass,
      which the Lord hath made known unto us.<BR />
      16 And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and
      the babe lying in a manger.<BR />
      17 And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying
      which was told them concerning this child.<BR />
      18 And all they that heard it wondered at those things which
      were told them by the shepherds.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor1293511"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">19 But
      Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.<BR />
      20 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for
      all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto
      them.<BR />

      1 But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain
      of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the
      mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people
      shall flow unto it.<BR />
      2 And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up
      to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob;
      and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths:
      for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD
      from Jerusalem.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor1302500"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">3 And
      he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar

      nation, neither shall they learn war any more.<BR />
      4 But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig
      tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the LORD
      of hosts hath spoken it.<BR />
      5 For all people will walk every one in the name of his god,
      and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and

      2 But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the
      thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto
      me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been
      from of old, from everlasting.<BR />
      3 Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she which
      travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren

      7 Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every
      one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.<BR />
      8 He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.<BR />
      9 In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that
      God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might
      live through him.<BR />
      10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us,
      and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.<BR />
      11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.<BR />
      12 No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another,
      God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.<BR />
      13 Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because
      he hath given us of his Spirit.<BR />
      14 And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son
      to be the Saviour of the world.<BR />

      17 Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah,
      and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto
      them.<BR />
      18 And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers,
      and served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem
      for this their trespass.<BR />
      19 Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the
      LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give
      ear.<BR />
      20 And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada
      the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them,
      Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD,
      that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the LORD, he
      hath also forsaken you.<BR />
      21 And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones
      at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the
      LORD.<BR />
      22 Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada
      his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died,
      he said, The LORD look upon it, and require it.<BR />

      1 And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied,
      there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews,
      because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.<BR />
      2 Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto
      them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word
      of God, and serve tables.<BR />
      3 Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest
      report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint
      over this business.<BR />
      4 But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the
      ministry of the word.<BR />
      5 And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose
      Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip,
      and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas
      a proselyte of Antioch:<BR />
      6 Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed,
      they laid their hands on them.<BR />
      7 And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples
      multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests
      were obedient to the faith.<BR />
      8 And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and
      miracles among the people.<BR />
      9 Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called
      the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians,
      and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.<BR />
      10 And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit
      by which he spake.<BR />
      11 Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak
      blasphemous words against Moses, and against God.<BR />
      12 And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes,
      and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council,<BR />
      13 And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not
      to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:<BR />
      14 For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall
      destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses
      delivered us.<BR />

      7 But though the righteous be prevented with death, yet shall

      8 For honourable age is not that which standeth in length of

      9 But wisdom is the gray hair unto men, and an unspotted life
      is old age.<BR />
      10 He pleased God, and was beloved of him: so that living among

      59 And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord
      Jesus, receive my spirit.<BR />
      60 And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay
      not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell

      1 And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there
      was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem;
      and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of
      Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.<BR />
      2 And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great
      lamentation over him.<BR />
      3 As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every
      house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.<BR />
      4 Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where
      preaching the word.<BR />
      5 Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached
      Christ unto them.<BR />
      6 And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things
      which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he
      did.<BR />
      7 For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many
      that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and
      that were lame, were healed.<BR />

      hast also found grace in my sight.<BR />
      13 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight,
      show me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace
      in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.<BR />

      16 For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have
      found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us?
      so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people
      that are upon the face of the earth.<BR />
      17 And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that
      thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and

      be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on
      whom I will show mercy.<BR />
      20 And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no

      21 When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified,

      22 Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom

      23 Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples,

      1 In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting
      upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.<BR />
      2 Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with
      twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet,
      and with twain he did fly.<BR />
      3 And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is
      the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.<BR />
      4 And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried,
      and the house was filled with smoke.<BR />

      said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean
      lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for
      mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.<BR />
      6 Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal
      in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:<BR />
      7 And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched
      thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.<BR />
      8 Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send,
      and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.<BR />

      1 The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to
      show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass;
      and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John:<BR />
      2 Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of
      Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.<BR />

      this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein:
      for the time is at hand.<BR />

      you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is
      to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;<BR />
      5 And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the
      first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the
      earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in
      his own blood,<BR />
      6 And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father;
      to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.<BR />
      7 Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him,
      and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth
      shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.<BR />
      8 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the
      Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.<BR />
      9 I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation,
      and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle
      that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony
      of Jesus Christ.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor1365216"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">10 I
      was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great
      voice, as of a trumpet,<BR />
      11 Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and,
      What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven
      churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and
      unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia,
      and unto Laodicea.<BR />
      12 And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being
      turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;<BR />
      13 And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the
      Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt
      about the paps with a golden girdle.<BR />
      14 His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow;
      and his eyes were as a flame of fire;<BR />
      15 And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a
      furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.<BR />
      16 And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth
      went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun
      shineth in his strength.<BR />
      17 And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid
      his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first
      and the last:<BR />

      are, and the things which shall be hereafter;<BR />
      20 The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right
      hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are
      the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks

      1 At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who

      2 And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the
      midst of them,<BR />
      3 And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and
      become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom
      of heaven.<BR />
      4 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child,
      the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.<BR />
      5 And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth
      me.<BR />
      6 But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe
      in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about
      his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.<BR />
      7 Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be
      that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!<BR />
      8 Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off,
      and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into
      life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet
      to be cast into everlasting fire.<BR />
      9 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from
      thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye,
      rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.<BR />

      13 And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth

      the married wife, saith the LORD.<BR />
      2 Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the

      8 In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but
      with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the

      9 For this is as the waters of Noah unto me: for as I have sworn
