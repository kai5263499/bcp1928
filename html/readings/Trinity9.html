      Ezekiel 14:1-11</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat
      before me.<BR />
      2 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<BR />
      3 Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart,
      and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face:
      should I be inquired of at all by them?<BR />
      4 Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the
      Lord GOD; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his
      idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity
      before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the LORD will answer
      him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols;<BR />
      5 That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because
      they are all estranged from me through their idols.<BR />
      6 Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord
      GOD; Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away
      your faces from all your abominations.<BR />
      7 For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that
      sojourneth in Israel, which separateth himself from me, and setteth
      up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of
      his iniquity before his face, and cometh to a prophet to inquire
      of him concerning me; I the LORD will answer him by myself:<BR />
      8 And I will set my face against that man, and will make him
      a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of
      my people; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.<BR />
      9 And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing,
      I the LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out
      my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people
      Israel.<BR />
      10 And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the
      punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of
      him that seeketh unto him;<BR />
      11 That the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither
      be polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that
      they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord
      GOD.<BR />

      1 Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by
      the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to
      walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more.<BR />
      2 For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.<BR />
      3 For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that
      ye should abstain from fornication:<BR />
      4 That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel
      in sanctification and honour;<BR />
      5 Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which
      know not God:<BR />
      6 That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter:
      because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also
      have forewarned you and testified.<BR />
      7 For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.<BR />
      8 He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who
      hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.<BR />

      Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more
      and more;<BR />
      11 And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business,
      and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;<BR />
      12 That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and
      that ye may have lack of nothing.<BR />

      1 Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend
      to know understanding.<BR />

      3 For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight

      21 Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst

      Hebrews 12:1-13 </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great
      a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the
      sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience
      the race that is set before us,<BR />
      2 Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who
      for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising
      the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of
      God.<BR />
      3 For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners
      against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.<BR />
      4 Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.<BR />
      5 And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you
      as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of
      the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:<BR />
      6 For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every
      son whom he receiveth.<BR />
      7 If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons;
      for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?<BR />
      8 But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers,
      then are ye bastards, and not sons.<BR />
      9 Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected
      us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in
      subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?<BR />
      10 For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own
      pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of
      his holiness.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor637785"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">11 Now
      no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous:
      nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness
      unto them which are exercised thereby.<BR />
      12 Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble
      knees;<BR />
      13 And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is
      lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.<BR />

      1 Samuel 16:1-13</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for
      Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill
      thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite:
      for I have provided me a king among his sons.<BR />
      2 And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill
      me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am
      come to sacrifice to the LORD.<BR />
      3 And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what
      thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name
      unto thee.<BR />
      4 And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem.
      And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said,
      Comest thou peaceably?<BR />
      5 And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD:
      sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he
      sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.<BR />
      6 And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on
      Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD'S anointed is before him.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor19052"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">7 But
      the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on
      the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the
      LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance,
      but the LORD looketh on the heart.<BR />
      8 Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel.
      And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.<BR />
      9 Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath
      the LORD chosen this.<BR />
      10 Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel.
      And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.<BR />
      11 And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And
      he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth
      the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for
      we will not sit down till he come hither.<BR />
      12 And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal
      of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD
      said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.<BR />
      13 Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the
      midst of his brethren: and the spirit of the LORD came upon David
      from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.<BR />

      Luke 17:20-37</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      20 And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom
      of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of
      God cometh not with observation:<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor24557"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">21 Neither
      shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom
      of God is within you.<BR />
      22 And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye
      shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye
      shall not see it.<BR />
      23 And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not
      after them, nor follow them.<BR />
      24 For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part
      under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall
      also the Son of man be in his day.<BR />
      25 But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this
      generation.<BR />
      26 And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the
      days of the Son of man.<BR />
      27 They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given
      in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and
      the flood came, and destroyed them all.<BR />
      28 Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat,
      they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;<BR />
      29 But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire
      and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.<BR />
      30 Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.<BR />
      31 In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his
      stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and
      he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.<BR />
      32 Remember Lot's wife.<BR />
      33 Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever
      shall lose his life shall preserve it.<BR />
      34 I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed;
      the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.<BR />
      35 Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken,
      and the other left.<BR />
      36 Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and
      the other left.<BR />
      37 And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said
      unto them, Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be
      gathered together.<BR />

      Esther 5</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her
      royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house,
      over against the king's house: and the king sat upon his royal
      throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house.<BR />
      2 And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing
      in the court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the
      king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand.
      So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.<BR />
      3 Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther?
      and what is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half
      of the kingdom.<BR />
      4 And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the
      king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared
      for him.<BR />
      5 Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may
      do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet
      that Esther had prepared.<BR />
      6 And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What
      is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy
      request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.<BR />
      7 Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request
      is:<BR />
      8 If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it
      please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request,
      let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare
      for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king hath said.<BR />
      9 Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart:
      but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood
      not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against
      Mordecai.<BR />
      10 Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home,
      he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.<BR />
      11 And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude
      of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted
      him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants
      of the king.<BR />
      12 Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man
      come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared
      but myself; and tomorrow am I invited unto her also with the
      king.<BR />
      13 Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai
      the Jew sitting at the king's gate.<BR />
      14 Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let
      a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and tomorrow speak thou
      unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou
      in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased
      Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.<BR />

      Romans 1:1-17</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated
      unto the gospel of God,<BR />
      2 (Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)<BR />
      3 Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of
      the seed of David according to the flesh;<BR />
      4 And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to
      the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:<BR />
      5 By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience
      to the faith among all nations, for his name:<BR />
      6 Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:<BR />
      7 To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints:
      Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus
      Christ.<BR />
      8 First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that
      your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.<BR />
      9 For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel
      of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always
      in my prayers;<BR />
      10 Making request, if by any means now at length I might have
      a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.<BR />
      11 For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual
      gift, to the end ye may be established;<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor35286"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">12 That
      is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith
      both of you and me.<BR />
      13 Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes
      I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might
      have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.<BR />
      14 I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both
      to the wise, and to the unwise.<BR />
      15 So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to
      you that are at Rome also.<BR />
      16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the
      power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the
      Jew first, and also to the Greek.<BR />

      14 But the spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil
      spirit from the LORD troubled him.<BR />
      15 And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit
      from God troubleth thee.<BR />
      16 Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee,
      to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it
      shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee,
      that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.<BR />
      17 And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that
      can play well, and bring him to me.<BR />
      18 Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have
      seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing,
      and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters,
      and a comely person, and the LORD is with him.<BR />
      19 Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send
      me David thy son, which is with the sheep.<BR />
      20 And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine,
      and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.<BR />
      21 And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved
      him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.<BR />
      22 And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand
      before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.<BR />

      1 And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought
      always to pray, and not to faint;<BR />
      2 Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God,
      neither regarded man:<BR />
      3 And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him,
      saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.<BR />
      4 And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within
      himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;<BR />
      5 Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest
      by her continual coming she weary me.<BR />
      6 And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.<BR />
      7 And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night
      unto him, though he bear long with them?<BR />

      you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the
      Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?<BR />
      9 And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves
      that they were righteous, and despised others:<BR />
      10 Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee,
      and the other a publican.<BR />
      11 The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank
      thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers,
      or even as this publican.<BR />
      12 I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.<BR />
      13 And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so
      much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying,
      God be merciful to me a sinner.<BR />
      14 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather
      than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be
      abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.<BR />

      1 On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to
      bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read
      before the king.<BR />
      2 And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana
      and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the keepers of the
      door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.<BR />
      3 And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to
      Mordecai for this? Then said the king's servants that ministered
      unto him, There is nothing done for him.<BR />
      4 And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come
      into the outward court of the king's house, to speak unto the
      king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for
      him.<BR />
      5 And the king's servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth
      in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor57577"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">6 So Haman
      came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto
      the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought
      in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour more
      than to myself?<BR />
      7 And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth
      to honour,<BR />
      8 Let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear,
      and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal
      which is set upon his head:<BR />
      9 And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of
      one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the
      man withal whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him
      on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before
      him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth
      to honour.<BR />
      10 Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel
      and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai
      the Jew, that sitteth at the king's gate: let nothing fail of
      all that thou hast spoken.<BR />
      11 Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai,
      and brought him on horseback through the street of the city,
      and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man
      whom the king delighteth to honour.<BR />
      12 And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hasted
      to his house mourning, and having his head covered.<BR />
      13 And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing
      that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his
      wife unto him, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before
      whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against
      him, but shalt surely fall before him.<BR />
      14 And while they were yet talking with him, came the king's
      chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that
      Esther had prepared.<BR />

      1 Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle,
      and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah,
      and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.<BR />
      2 And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and
      pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against
      the Philistines.<BR />
      3 And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and
      Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a
      valley between them.<BR />
      4 And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines,
      named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.<BR />
      5 And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed
      with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand
      shekels of brass.<BR />
      6 And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of
      brass between his shoulders.<BR />
      7 And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his
      spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing
      a shield went before him.<BR />
      8 And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said
      unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am
      not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man
      for you, and let him come down to me.<BR />
      9 If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we
      be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him,

      be granted thee: and what is thy request? and it shall be performed,
      even to the half of the kingdom.<BR />
      3 Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour
      in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life
      be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:<BR />
      4 For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain,
      and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen,
      I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail
      the king's damage.<BR />
      5 Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen,
      Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to
      do so?<BR />
      6 And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman.
      Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.<BR />
      7 And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath
      went into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request
      for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil
      determined against him by the king.<BR />
      8 Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place
      of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon
      Esther was. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also
      before me in the house? As the word went out of the king's mouth,
      they covered Haman's face.<BR />
      9 And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king,
      Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made
      for Mordecai, who had spoken good for the king, standeth in the
      house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon.<BR />

      heard them.<BR />
      24 And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from
      him, and were sore afraid.<BR />
      25 And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is
      come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be,
      that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great
      riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's
      house free in Israel.<BR />
      26 And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What
      shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh
      away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised
      Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?<BR />
      27 And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So
      shall it be done to the man that killeth him.<BR />

      31 Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold,
      we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the
      prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.<BR />
      32 For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be
      mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:<BR />
      33 And they shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the
      third day he shall rise again.<BR />
      34 And they understood none of these things: and this saying
      was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.<BR />
      35 And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho,
      a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:<BR />
      36 And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.<BR />
      37 And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.<BR />
      38 And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy
      on me.<BR />
      39 And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold
      his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou son of David,
      have mercy on me.<BR />
      40 And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him:
      and when he was come near, he asked him,<BR />

      Lord, that I may receive my sight.<BR />

      1 The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the
      days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he
      saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.<BR />
      2 Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein
      is: and let the Lord GOD be witness against you, the Lord from
      his holy temple.<BR />
      3 For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place, and will
      come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.<BR />
      4 And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys
      shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, and as the waters that
      are poured down a steep place.<BR />
      5 For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins
      of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is
      it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are they
      not Jerusalem?<BR />
      6 Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, and
      as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof
      into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.<BR />
      7 And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces,
      and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and
      all the idols thereof will I lay desolate.<BR />

      3 For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make
      the faith of God without effect?<BR />
      4 God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as
      it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings,
      and mightest overcome when thou art judged.<BR />
      5 But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God,
      what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I
      speak as a man)<BR />
      6 God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?<BR />
      7 For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto
      his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?<BR />
      8 And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some
      affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose
      damnation is just.<BR />
      9 What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we
      have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all
      under sin;<BR />
      10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:<BR />
      11 There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh
      after God.<BR />
      12 They are all gone out of the way, they are together become
      unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.<BR />
      13 Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they
      have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:<BR />
      14 Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:<BR />
      15 Their feet are swift to shed blood:<BR />
      16 Destruction and misery are in their ways:<BR />
      17 And the way of peace have they not known:<BR />
      18 There is no fear of God before their eyes.<BR />
      19 Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith
      to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped,
      and all the world may become guilty before God.<BR />
      20 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be
      justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.<BR />

      28 And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the
      men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said,
      Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those
      few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness
      of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see
      the battle.<BR />
      29 And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?<BR />
      30 And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the
      same manner: and the people answered him again after the former
      manner.<BR />
      31 And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed
      them before Saul: and he sent for him.<BR />
      32 And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of
      him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.<BR />
      33 And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this
      Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he
      a man of war from his youth.<BR />
      34 And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep,
      and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the
      flock:<BR />
      35 And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it
      out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him
      by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.<BR />
      36 Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised
      Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the
      armies of the living God.<BR />
      37 David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the
      paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver
      me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David,
      Go, and the LORD be with thee.<BR />
      38 And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet
      of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.<BR />
      39 And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed
      to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I
      cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put
      them off him.<BR />
      40 And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth
      stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which
      he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he
      drew near to the Philistine.<BR />

      1 And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.<BR />
      2 And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the
      chief among the publicans, and he was rich.<BR />
      3 And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the
      press, because he was little of stature.<BR />
      4 And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see
      him: for he was to pass that way.<BR />
      5 And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him,
      and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for
      today I must abide at thy house.<BR />
      6 And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.<BR />
      7 And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was
      gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.<BR />
      8 And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord,
      the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken
      any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.<BR />
      9 And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this
      house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.<BR />
      10 For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which
      was lost.<BR />

      1 Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their
      beds! when the morning is light, they practice it, because it
      is in the power of their hand.<BR />
      2 And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses,
      and take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even
      a man and his heritage.<BR />
      3 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family
      do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks;
      neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time is evil.<BR />
      4 In that day shall one take up a parable against you, and lament
      with a doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly spoiled: he
      hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed it
      from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.<BR />
      5 Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot
      in the congregation of the LORD.<BR />
      6 Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy: they shall
      not prophesy to them, that they shall not take shame.<BR />
      7 O thou that art named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of
      the LORD straitened? are these his doings? do not my words do
      good to him that walketh uprightly?<BR />
      8 Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off
      the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as
      men averse from war.<BR />
      9 The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant
      houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.<BR />
      10 Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it
      is polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction.<BR />
      11 If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying,
      I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall
      even be the prophet of this people.<BR />
      12 I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely
      gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the
      sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they
      shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men.<BR />
      13 The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and
      have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their

      43 And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou
      comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by
      his gods.<BR />
      44 And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give
      thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the
      field.<BR />
      45 Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with
      a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee
      in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel,
      whom thou hast defied.<BR />
      46 This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I
      will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give

      47 And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not
      with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD'S, and he will
      give you into our hands.<BR />
      48 And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and
      drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the

      49 And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone,

      51 Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took
      his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him,

      11 And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable,
      because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that

      12 He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country
      to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.<BR />
      13 And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds,
      and said unto them, Occupy till I come.<BR />
      14 But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him,
      saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.<BR />
      15 And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received
      the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto
      him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much
      every man had gained by trading.<BR />
      16 Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten

      19 And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.<BR />
      20 And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound,
      which I have kept laid up in a napkin:<BR />
      21 For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest
      up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not
      sow.<BR />
      22 And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge
      thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere
      man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not
      sow:<BR />
      23 Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that
      at my coming I might have required mine own with usury?<BR />
      24 And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound,
      and give it to him that hath ten pounds.<BR />
      25 (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)<BR />
      26 For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be

      to Jerusalem.<BR />

      Micah 3:1-8</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes
      of the house of Israel; Is it not for you to know judgment?<BR />
      2 Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin
      from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;<BR />
      3 Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from
      off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces,
      as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.<BR />
      4 Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them:
      he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have
      behaved themselves ill in their doings.<BR />
      5 Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people
      err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that
      putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against
      him.<BR />
      6 Therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a
      vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine;
      and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall
      be dark over them.<BR />
      7 Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded:
      yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer
      of God.<BR />
      8 But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and
      of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression,
      and to Israel his sin.<BR />

      Lesson<BR />
      Romans 4:1-12</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining
      to the flesh, hath found?<BR />
      2 For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to
      glory; but not before God.<BR />
      3 For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it
      was counted unto him for righteousness.<BR />
      4 Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace,
      but of debt.<BR />
      5 But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth
      the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.<BR />
      6 Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto
      whom God imputeth righteousness without works,<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor153472"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">7 Saying,
      Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins
      are covered.<BR />
      8 Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.<BR />
      9 Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or
      upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned
      to Abraham for righteousness.<BR />
      10 How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or
      in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.<BR />
      11 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness
      of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might
      be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised;
      that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:<BR />
      12 And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the
      circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith
      of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.</FONT></P>
