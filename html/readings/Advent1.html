      1 Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the
      way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come
      to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight
      in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts.<BR />
      2 But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand
      when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like
      fullers' soap:<BR />
      3 And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he
      shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver,
      that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.<BR />
      4 Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant
      unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor1196248"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">5 And
      I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness
      against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against
      false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in
      his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside
      the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the LORD
      of hosts.<BR />
      6 For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob
      are not consumed.<BR />
      4 Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded
      unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judgments.<BR />
      5 Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming
      of the great and dreadful day of the LORD:<BR />
      6 And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children,
      and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and

      Luke 1:5-25</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      5 There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain
      priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was
      of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.<BR />
      6 And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the
      commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.<BR />
      7 And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and
      they both were now well stricken in years.<BR />
      8 And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office
      before God in the order of his course,<BR />
      9 According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was
      to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.<BR />
      10 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without
      at the time of incense.<BR />
      11 And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing
      on the right side of the altar of incense.<BR />
      12 And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell
      upon him.<BR />
      13 But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy
      prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son,
      and thou shalt call his name John.<BR />
      14 And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice
      at his birth.<BR />
      15 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall
      drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with
      the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.<BR />
      16 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord
      their God.<BR />
      17 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias,
      to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient
      to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for
      the Lord.<BR />
      18 And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this?
      for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.<BR />
      19 And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that
      stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee,
      and to show thee these glad tidings.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor1202143"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">20 And,
      behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the
      day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest
      not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.<BR />
      21 And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he
      tarried so long in the temple.<BR />
      22 And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they
      perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned
      unto them, and remained speechless.<BR />
      23 And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration
      were accomplished, he departed to his own house.<BR />
      24 And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid
      herself five months, saying,<BR />
      25 Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked
      on me, to take away my reproach among men.<BR />

      1 For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's
      sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth
      as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth.<BR />
      2 And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings
      thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the
      mouth of the LORD shall name.<BR />
      3 Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD,
      and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.<BR />
      4 Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land
      any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzibah,
      and thy land Beulah: for the LORD delighteth in thee, and thy
      land shall be married.<BR />
      5 For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry
      thee: and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall
      thy God rejoice over thee.<BR />
      6 I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, which shall
      never hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of
      the LORD, keep not silence.<BR />
      7 And give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem
      a praise in the earth.<BR />
      8 The LORD hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his
      strength, Surely I will no more give thy corn to be meat for
      thine enemies; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy
      wine, for the which thou hast laboured:<BR />
      9 But they that have gathered it shall eat it and praise the
      LORD; and they that have brought it together shall drink it in
      the courts of my holiness.<BR />
      10 Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the
      people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones;
      lift up a standard for the people.<BR />
      11 Behold, the LORD hath proclaimed unto the end of the world,

      Matthew 25:1-13</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins,
      which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.<BR />
      2 And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.<BR />
      3 They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with
      them:<BR />
      4 But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.<BR />
      5 While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.<BR />
      6 And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom
      cometh; go ye out to meet him.<BR />
      7 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.<BR />
      8 And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for
      our lamps are gone out.<BR />
      9 But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough
      for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for
      yourselves.<BR />
      10 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they
      that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door
      was shut.<BR />
      11 Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord,
      open to us.<BR />
      12 But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you
      not.<BR />
      13 Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour
      wherein the Son of man cometh.<BR />

      1 The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning

      2 Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken,
      I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled
      against me.<BR />
      3 The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but

      children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they
      have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone

      1 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;<BR />
      2 As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger
      before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.<BR />
      3 The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way
      of the Lord, make his paths straight.<BR />
      4 John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism
      of repentance for the remission of sins.<BR />
      5 And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they
      of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan,
      confessing their sins.<BR />
      6 And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of
      a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;<BR />
      7 And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after
      me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down
      and unloose.<BR />
      8 I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize
      you with the Holy Ghost.<BR />
      9 And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth
      of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.<BR />
      10 And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens
      opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:<BR />
      11 And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved
      Son, in whom I am well pleased.<BR />

      preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,<BR />
      15 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God
      is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.<BR />
      16 Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew
      his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.<BR />

      18 And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.<BR />
      19 And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James
      the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the
      ship mending their nets.<BR />
      20 And straightway he called them: and they left their father
      Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.<BR />
      21 And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath
      day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.<BR />

      they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one
      that had authority, and not as the scribes.<BR />
      23 And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit;
      and he cried out,<BR />
      24 Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus
      of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou
      art, the Holy One of God.<BR />
      25 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out
      of him.<BR />
      26 And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a
      loud voice, he came out of him.<BR />
      27 And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among
      themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is
      this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits,
      and they do obey him.<BR />
      28 And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the
      region round about Galilee.<BR />

      1 After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven:
      and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet
      talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will show
      thee things which must be hereafter.<BR />
      2 And immediately I was in the spirit; and, behold, a throne
      was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.<BR />
      3 And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine
      stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight
      like unto an emerald.<BR />
      4 And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and
      upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed
      in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.<BR />
      5 And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings
      and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before
      the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.<BR />
      6 And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal:
      and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were
      four beasts full of eyes before and behind.<BR />
      7 And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like
      a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth
      beast was like a flying eagle.<BR />
      8 And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and
      they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night,
      saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is,
      and is to come.<BR />
      9 And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him
      that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,<BR />
      10 The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on
      the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and
      cast their crowns before the throne, saying,<BR />
      11 Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power:

      twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet,
      and with twain he did fly.<BR />
      3 And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is

      and the house was filled with smoke.<BR />
      5 Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man
      of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean
      lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.<BR />
      6 Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal
