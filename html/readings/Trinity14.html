      Micah 6:1-8</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Hear ye now what the LORD saith; Arise, contend thou before
      the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.<BR />
      2 Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD'S controversy, and ye strong
      foundations of the earth: for the LORD hath a controversy with
      his people, and he will plead with Israel.<BR />
      3 O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I
      wearied thee? testify against me.<BR />
      4 For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed
      thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses,
      Aaron, and Miriam.<BR />
      5 O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted,
      and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto
      Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the LORD.<BR />
      6 Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before
      the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with
      calves of a year old?<BR />
      7 Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten
      thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my
      transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?<BR />
      8 He hath shown thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the
      LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and
      to walk humbly with thy God?<BR />

      Philippians 4:4-13 </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      4 Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say, Rejoice.<BR />
      5 Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.<BR />
      6 Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication
      with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.<BR />
      7 And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall
      keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.<BR />
      8 Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things
      are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are
      pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of
      good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise,
      think on these things.<BR />
      9 Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and
      heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with
      you.<BR />
      10 But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your
      care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful,
      but ye lacked opportunity.<BR />
      11 Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in
      whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.<BR />
      12 I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every
      where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to
      be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.<BR />
      13 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.<BR />

      word, and say, Hear the word of the LORD, all ye of Judah, that
      enter in at these gates to worship the LORD.<BR />

      18 Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto
      shall I resemble it?<BR />
      19 It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and
      cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and
      the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.<BR />
      20 And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of
      God?<BR />
      21 It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures
      of meal, till the whole was leavened.<BR />
      22 And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and
      journeying toward Jerusalem.<BR />
      23 Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved?
      And he said unto them,<BR />
      24 Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto
      you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.<BR />
      25 When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut
      to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the

      say unto you, I know you not whence ye are:<BR />

      see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the

      2 Samuel 16:23-17:14 </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      23 And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those
      days, was as if a man had inquired at the oracle of God: so was
      all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.<BR />
      1 Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out
      twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David
      this night:<BR />
      2 And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed,
      and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him
      shall flee; and I will smite the king only:<BR />
      3 And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom
      thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be
      in peace.<BR />
      4 And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of
      Israel.<BR />
      5 Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let
      us hear likewise what he saith.<BR />
      6 And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him,
      saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do
      after his saying? if not; speak thou.<BR />
      7 And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath
      given is not good at this time.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor85039"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">8 For,
      said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be
      mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed
      of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and
      will not lodge with the people.<BR />
      9 Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place:
      and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at
      the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter
      among the people that follow Absalom.<BR />
      10 And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of
      a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father
      is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men.<BR />
      11 Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered
      unto thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that is by
      the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own
      person.<BR />
      12 So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be
      found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground:
      and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not
      be left so much as one.<BR />
      13 Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel
      bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river,
      until there be not one small stone found there.<BR />
      14 And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of
      Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.
      For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel,
      to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.<BR />

      20 The fear of the Lord is all wisdom; and in all wisdom is the
      performance of the law, and the knowledge of his omnipotency.<BR />

      23 There is a wickedness, and the same an abomination; and there

      24 He that hath small understanding, and feareth God, is better
      than one that hath much wisdom, and transgresseth the law of
      the most High.<BR />
      25 There is an exquisite subtilty, and the same is unjust; and
      there is one that turneth aside to make judgment appear; and
      there is a wise man that justifieth in judgment.<BR />
      26 There is a wicked man that hangeth down his head sadly; but

      15 Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus
      and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel;
      and thus and thus have I counselled.<BR />
      16 Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge
      not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily
      pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people
      that are with him.<BR />
      17 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by En-rogel; for they might
      not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told
      them; and they went and told king David.<BR />
      18 Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went
      both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim,
      which had a well in his court; whither they went down.<BR />
      19 And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth,
      and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.<BR />
      20 And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house,
      they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said
      unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they
      had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.<BR />
      21 And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came
      up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto
      David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath
      Ahithophel counselled against you.<BR />
      22 Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and
      they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not
      one of them that was not gone over Jordan.<BR />
      23 And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed,
      he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house,
      to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself,
      and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.<BR />

      9 There is a sinner that hath good success in evil things; and
      there is a gain that turneth to loss.<BR />
      10 There is a gift that shall not profit thee; and there is a
      gift whose recompence is double.<BR />
      11 There is an abasement because of glory; and there is that
      lifteth up his head from a low estate.<BR />
      12 There is that buyeth much for a little, and repayeth it sevenfold.<BR />
      13 A wise man by his words maketh him beloved: but the graces
      of fools shall be poured out.<BR />
      14 The gift of a fool shall do thee no good when thou hast it;
      neither yet of the envious for his necessity: for he looketh
      to receive many things for one.<BR />
      15 He giveth little, and upbraideth much; he openeth his mouth
      like a crier; to day he lendeth, and to morrow will he ask it
      again: such an one is to be hated of God and man.<BR />
      16 The fool saith, I have no friends, I have no thank for all
      my good deeds, and they that eat my bread speak evil of me.<BR />
      17 How oft, and of how many shall he be laughed to scorn! for
      he knoweth not aright what it is to have; and it is all one unto
      him as if he had it not.<BR />

      1 And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains
      of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.<BR />
      2 And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand
      of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of
      Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai
      the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely
      go forth with you myself also.<BR />
      3 But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we
      flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die,
      will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of
      us: therefore now it is better that thou succour us out of the
      city.<BR />
      4 And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do.
      And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came
      out by hundreds and by thousands.<BR />
      5 And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying,
      Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom.
      And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains
      charge concerning Absalom.<BR />
      6 So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the
      battle was in the wood of Ephraim;<BR />
      7 Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of
      David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty
      thousand men.<BR />
      8 For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the
      country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the
      sword devoured.<BR />
      9 And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon
      a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak,
      and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between
      the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went
      away.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor386774"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">10 And
      a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw
      Absalom hanged in an oak.<BR />
      11 And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou
      sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground?
      and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.<BR />
      12 And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand
      shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine
      hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged
      thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the
      young man Absalom.<BR />
      13 Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own
      life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself
      wouldest have set thyself against me.<BR />
      14 Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took
      three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of
      Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.<BR />
      15 And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about
      and smote Absalom, and slew him.<BR />
      16 And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing
      after Israel: for Joab held back the people.<BR />
      17 And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the
      wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all
      Israel fled every one to his tent.<BR />

      2 Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man,
      we have defrauded no man.<BR />
      3 I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that
      ye are in our hearts to die and live with you.<BR />
      4 Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying
      of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all
      our tribulation.<BR />
      5 For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest,
      but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within
      were fears.<BR />
      6 Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down,
      comforted us by the coming of Titus;<BR />
      7 And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith
      he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire,
      your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced
      the more.<BR />
      8 For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent,
      though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath
      made you sorry, though it were but for a season.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor393792"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">9 Now
      I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed
      to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that
      ye might receive damage by us in nothing.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor392524"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">10 For
      godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented
      of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.<BR />
      11 For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly
      sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing
      of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what
      vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things
      ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.<BR />
      12 Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause
      that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong,
      but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto
      you.<BR />
      13 Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly
      the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was
      refreshed by you all.<BR />
      14 For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed;
      but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting,
      which I made before Titus, is found a truth.<BR />
      15 And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst
      he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling
      ye received him.<BR />
      16 I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.<BR />

      7 Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance,
      and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us,
      see that ye abound in this grace also.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor420348"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">8 I speak
      not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others,
      and to prove the sincerity of your love.<BR />
      9 For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though
      he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through
      his poverty might be rich.<BR />
      10 And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you,
      who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward
      a year ago.<BR />
      11 Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a
      readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of
      that which ye have.<BR />
      12 For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according
      to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.<BR />
      13 For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:<BR />
      14 But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may
      be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be
      a supply for your want: that there may be equality:<BR />
      15 As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over;
      and he that had gathered little had no lack.<BR />

      13 Curse the whisperer and doubletongued: for such have destroyed
      many that were at peace.<BR />
      14 A backbiting tongue hath disquieted many, and driven them
      from nation to nation: strong cities hath it pulled down, and
      overthrown the houses of great men.<BR />
      15 A backbiting tongue hath cast out virtuous women, and deprived

      23 Such as forsake the Lord shall fall into it; and it shall

      for Absalom.<BR />
      2 And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all
      the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was

      voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!<BR />
      5 And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast
      shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day
      have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters,
      and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;<BR />

      and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.<BR />
      7 Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy
      servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there
      will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse

      8 Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto
      all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate.
      And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled
      every man to his tent.<BR />
      9 And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes
      of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies,
      and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now
      he is fled out of the land for Absalom.<BR />
      10 And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle.

      12 If thou sit at a bountiful table, be not greedy upon it, and
      say not, There is much meat on it.<BR />
      13 Remember that a wicked eye is an evil thing: and what is created
      more wicked than an eye? therefore it weepeth upon every occasion.<BR />
      14 Stretch not thine hand whithersoever it looketh, and thrust
      it not with him into the dish.<BR />
      15 Judge not thy neighbour by thyself: and be discreet in every
      point.<BR />
      16 Eat as it becometh a man, those things which are set before
      thee; and devour not, lest thou be hated.<BR />
      17 Leave off first for manners' sake; and be not unsatiable,
      lest thou offend.<BR />
      18 When thou sittest among many, reach not thine hand out first
      of all.<BR />
      25 Shew not thy valiantness in wine; for wine hath destroyed
      many.<BR />
      26 The furnace proveth the edge by dipping: so doth wine the
      hearts of the proud by drunkeness.<BR />
      27 Wine is as good as life to a man, if it be drunk moderately:
      what life is then to a man that is without wine? for it was made
      to make men glad.<BR />
      28 Wine measurably drunk and in season bringeth gladness of the
      heart, and cheerfulness of the mind:<BR />
      29 But wine drunken with excess maketh bitterness of the mind,
      with brawling and quarrelling.<BR />
      30 Drunkenness increaseth the rage of a fool till he offend:
      it diminisheth strength, and maketh wounds.<BR />
      31 Rebuke not thy neighbour at the wine, and despise him not
      in his mirth: give him no despiteful words, and press not upon
      him with urging him [to drink.]<BR />
      1 If thou be made the master [of a feast,] lift not thyself up,
      but be among them as one of the rest; take diligent care for
      them, and so sit down.<BR />
      2 And when thou hast done all thy office, take thy place, that

      1 Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of
      them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in
      heaven.<BR />
      2 Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet
      before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the
      streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you,

      5 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites
      are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in
      the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily

      thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret;
      and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.<BR />
      7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen
      do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.<BR />
      8 Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth
      what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.<BR />
      9 After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in

      16 Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad

      unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.<BR />
      17 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy
      face;<BR />
      18 That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father
      which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall
      reward thee openly.<BR />

      all Israel is come to the king, even to his house.<BR />
      12 Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore

      14 And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the
      heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king,
      Return thou, and all thy servants.<BR />
      15 So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to
      Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.<BR />
      16 And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim,
      hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.<BR />
      17 And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba
      the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his
      twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the
      king.<BR />
      18 And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's
      household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son
      of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;<BR />
      19 And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto
      me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely
      the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the
      king should take it to his heart.<BR />
      20 For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold,
      I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go
      down to meet my lord the king.<BR />
      21 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not
      Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD'S
      anointed?<BR />
      22 And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah,
      that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any
      man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that
      I am this day king over Israel?<BR />

      1 For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous
      for me to write to you:<BR />
      2 For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast
      of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago;

      4 Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you
      unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this
      same confident boasting.<BR />
      5 Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that
      they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty,
      whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as
      a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.<BR />

      The hopes of a man void of understanding are vain and false:
      and dreams lift up fools.<BR />
      2 Whoso regardeth dreams is like him that catcheth at a shadow,
      and followeth after the wind.<BR />
      3 The vision of dreams is the resemblance of one thing to another,
      even as the likeness of a face to a face.<BR />
      4 Of an unclean thing what can be cleansed? and from that thing
      which is false what truth can come?<BR />
      5 Divinations, and soothsayings, and dreams, are vain: and the
      heart fancieth, as a woman's heart in travail.<BR />
      6 If they be not sent from the most High in thy visitation, set
      not thy heart upon them.<BR />
      7 For dreams have deceived many, and they have failed that put
      their trust in them.<BR />
      8 The law shall be found perfect without lies: and wisdom is
      perfection to a faithful mouth.<BR />

      Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and
      rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:<BR />
      20 But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither
      moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through
      nor steal:<BR />
      21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.<BR />
      22 The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be
      single, thy whole body shall be full of light.<BR />
      23 But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of
      darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness,
      how great is that darkness!<BR />

      man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and
      love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise
      the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.<BR />
      25 Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what
      ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body,
      what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the
      body than raiment?<BR />
      26 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do
      they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth
      them. Are ye not much better than they?<BR />
      27 Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his
      stature?<BR />
      28 And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of
      the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:<BR />
      29 And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory
      was not arrayed like one of these.<BR />
      30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which
      today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much
      more clothe you, O ye of little faith?<BR />
      31 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or,
      What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?<BR />
      32 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your
      heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.<BR />
      33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness;
      and all these things shall be added unto you.<BR />
      34 Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall
      take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day
      is the evil thereof.<BR />
