      Jeremiah 31:1-14</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 At the same time, saith the LORD, will I be the God of all
      the families of Israel, and they shall be my people.<BR />
      2 Thus saith the LORD, The people which were left of the sword
      found grace in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause
      him to rest.<BR />
      3 The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have
      loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness
      have I drawn thee.<BR />
      4 Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin
      of Israel: thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and
      shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry.<BR />
      5 Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the
      planters shall plant, and shall eat them as common things.<BR />
      6 For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon the mount
      Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the
      LORD our God.<BR />
      7 For thus saith the LORD; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and
      shout among the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye,
      and say, O LORD, save thy people, the remnant of Israel.<BR />
      8 Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather
      them from the coasts of the earth, and with them the blind and
      the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with child
      together: a great company shall return thither.<BR />
      9 They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I
      lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters
      in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a
      father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.<BR />
      10 Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare it in
      the isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather
      him, and keep him, as a shepherd doth his flock.<BR />
      11 For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the
      hand of him that was stronger than he.<BR />
      12 Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion,
      and shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat,
      and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and
      of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and
      they shall not sorrow any more at all.<BR />
      13 Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men
      and old together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and
      will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.<BR />

      9 And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named
      Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto
      him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.<BR />
      10 And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold,
      many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his
      disciples.<BR />
      11 And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples,
      Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?<BR />
      12 But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be
      whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.<BR />
      13 But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy,
      and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but
      sinners to repentance.<BR />

      1 Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep
      of my pasture! saith the LORD.<BR />
      2 Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel against the pastors
      that feed my people; Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them
      away, and have not visited them: behold, I will visit upon you
      the evil of your doings, saith the LORD.<BR />
      3 And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries
      whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their
      folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase.<BR />
      4 And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them:
      and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they
      be lacking, saith the LORD.<BR />
      5 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto
      David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper,
      and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.<BR />
      6 In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely:
      and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR
      RIGHTEOUSNESS.<BR />
      7 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that they
      shall no more say, The LORD liveth, which brought up the children
      of Israel out of the land of Egypt;<BR />
      8 But, The LORD liveth, which brought up and which led the seed
      of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all
      countries whither I had driven them; and they shall dwell in
      their own land.<BR />

      2 And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the
      chief among the publicans, and he was rich.<BR />
      3 And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the
      press, because he was little of stature.<BR />
      4 And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see
      him: for he was to pass that way.<BR />
      5 And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him,
      and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for
      today I must abide at thy house.<BR />
      6 And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.<BR />
      7 And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was
      gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.<BR />
      8 And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord,
      the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken
      any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.<BR />
      9 And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this
      house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.<BR />
      10 For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which
      was lost.<BR />

      1 Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day,
      saying,<BR />
      2 Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people
      willingly offered themselves.<BR />
      3 Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing
      unto the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.<BR />
      4 LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out
      of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped,
      the clouds also dropped water.<BR />
      5 The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai
      from before the LORD God of Israel.<BR />
      6 In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael,
      the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through
      byways.<BR />
      7 The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel,
      until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.<BR />
      8 They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a
      shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?<BR />
      9 My heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves
      willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD.<BR />
      10 Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment,
      and walk by the way.<BR />
      11 They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places
      of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts
      of the LORD, even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of
      his villages in Israel: then shall the people of the LORD go
      down to the gates.<BR />
      12 Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise,
      Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.<BR />
      13 Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles
      among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.<BR />
      14 Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after
      thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors,
      and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.<BR />
      15 And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar,
      and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the
      divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.<BR />
      16 Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings
      of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings
      of heart.<BR />
      17 Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships?
      Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches.<BR />
      18 Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives
      unto the death in the high places of the field.<BR />

      39 And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind?
      shall they not both fall into the ditch?<BR />
      40 The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is
      perfect shall be as his master.<BR />
      41 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye,
      but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?<BR />
      42 Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me
      pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest
      not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out
      first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see
      clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.<BR />
      43 For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither
      doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.<BR />
      44 For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men
      do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.<BR />
      45 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth
      forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure
      of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance
      of the heart his mouth speaketh.<BR />
      46 And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which
      I say?<BR />
      47 Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth
      them, I will show you to whom he is like:<BR />
      48 He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and
      laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the
      stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it:
      for it was founded upon a rock.<BR />
      49 But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without
      a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the
      stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the
      ruin of that house was great.<BR />

      Nehemiah 5:1-13</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives
      against their brethren the Jews.<BR />
      2 For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters,
      are many: therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat,
      and live.<BR />
      3 Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands,
      vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the
      dearth.<BR />
      4 There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's
      tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards.<BR />
      5 Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children
      as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and
      our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought
      unto bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them;
      for other men have our lands and vineyards.<BR />
      6 And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.<BR />
      7 Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and
      the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of
      his brother. And I set a great assembly against them.<BR />
      8 And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our
      brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will
      ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then
      held they their peace, and found nothing to answer.<BR />
      9 Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk
      in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen
      our enemies?<BR />
      10 I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might exact
      of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.<BR />
      11 Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands,
      their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the
      hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the
      oil, that ye exact of them.<BR />
      12 Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing
      of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests,
      and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this
      promise.<BR />
      13 Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man
      from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this
      promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the
      congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people
      did according to this promise.<BR />

      44 And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together
      to hear the word of God.<BR />
      45 But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with
      envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul,
      contradicting and blaspheming.<BR />
      46 Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary
      that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but
      seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting
      life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.<BR />
      47 For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee
      to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation
      unto the ends of the earth.<BR />
      48 And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified
      the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal
      life believed.<BR />
      49 And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the
      region.<BR />
      50 But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and
      the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul
      and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.<BR />
      51 But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and
      came unto Iconium.<BR />
      52 And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy
      Ghost.<BR />
      1 And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together
      into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude
      both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.<BR />
      2 But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made
      their minds evil affected against the brethren.<BR />
      3 Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord,
      which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted
      signs and wonders to be done by their hands.<BR />
      4 But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with
      the Jews, and part with the apostles.<BR />
      5 And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and
      also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully,
      and to stone them,<BR />
      6 They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities
      of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about:<BR />
      7 And there they preached the gospel.<BR />

      on both sides, meet for the necks of them that take the spoil?<BR />

      1 Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the
      people, he entered into Capernaum.<BR />
      2 And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was
      sick, and ready to die.<BR />
      3 And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of
      the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.<BR />
      4 And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying,
      That he was worthy for whom he should do this:<BR />
      5 For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.<BR />
      6 Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from
      the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him,
      Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest
      enter under my roof:<BR />
      7 Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee:
      but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.<BR />
      8 For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers,
      and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and
      he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.<BR />
      9 When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned
      him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say
      unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.<BR />
      10 And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the
      servant whole that had been sick.<BR />

      1 And all the people gathered themselves together as one man
      into the street that was before the water gate; and they spake
      unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which
      the LORD had commanded to Israel.<BR />
      2 And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation
      both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding,
      upon the first day of the seventh month.<BR />
      3 And he read therein before the street that was before the water
      gate from the morning until midday, before the men and the women,
      and those that could understand; and the ears of all the people
      were attentive unto the book of the law.<BR />
      5 And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for
      he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the
      people stood up:<BR />
      6 And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. And all the people
      answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they bowed
      their heads, and worshipped the LORD with their faces to the
      ground.<BR />
      9 And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the
      scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all
      the people, This day is holy unto the LORD your God; mourn not,
      nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words
      of the law.<BR />
      10 Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink
      the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared:
      for this day is holy unto our Lord: neither be ye sorry; for
      the joy of the LORD is your strength.<BR />
      11 So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace,
      for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved.<BR />
      12 And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and
      to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood
      the words that were declared unto them.<BR />

      8 And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet,

      9 The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and
      perceiving that he had faith to be healed,<BR />
      10 Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he
      leaped and walked.<BR />
      11 And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up
      their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are

      12 And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because

      13 Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought

      1 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD:
      and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.<BR />
      11 And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak
      which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abi-ezrite:
      and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it
      from the Midianites.<BR />
      12 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto
      him, The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.<BR />
      13 And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with
      us, why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles
      which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring
      us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered
      us into the hands of the Midianites.<BR />
      14 And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might,
      and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have
      not I sent thee?<BR />
      15 And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel?
      behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in
      my father's house.<BR />
      16 And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and
      thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.<BR />
      33 Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children
      of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched
      in the valley of Jezreel.<BR />
      34 But the spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a
      trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.<BR />
      35 And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was
      gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto
      Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.<BR />

      12 Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there
      was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she

      13 And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said

      14 And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood

      Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with

      that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them,
      by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.<BR />
      2 And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee
      are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands,
      lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand
      hath saved me.<BR />
      3 Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying,
      Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early
      from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and

      every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.<BR />

      18 And the disciples of John showed him of all these things.<BR />
      19 And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to
      Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?<BR />
      20 When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath
      sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look
      we for another?<BR />
      21 And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and
      plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he
      gave sight.<BR />
      22 Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell
      John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see,
      the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead
      are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.<BR />
      23 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.<BR />
      24 And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to
      speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into
      the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?<BR />
      25 But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment?
      Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately,
      are in kings' courts.<BR />
      26 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto
      you, and much more than a prophet.<BR />
      27 This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger
      before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.<BR />
      28 For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there
      is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is
      least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.<BR />
      29 And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified
      God, being baptized with the baptism of John.<BR />
      30 But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God
      against themselves, being not baptized of him.<BR />
      31 And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of
      this generation? and to what are they like?<BR />
      32 They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and
      calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and

      32 Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible
      God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble
      seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings,
      on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and
      on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the
      kings of Assyria unto this day.<BR />
      33 Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for
      thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly:<BR />
      34 Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our
      fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and
      thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them.<BR />
      35 For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy
      great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat
      land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from
      their wicked works.<BR />
      36 Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that thou
      gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good
      thereof, behold, we are servants in it:<BR />
      37 And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast
      set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over
      our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are
      in great distress.<BR />
      38 And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write
      it; and our princes, Levites, and priests, seal unto it.<BR />

      Acts 15:1-12</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren,
      and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses,
      ye cannot be saved.<BR />
      2 When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and
      disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas,
      and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the
      apostles and elders about this question.<BR />
      3 And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through
      Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles:
      and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.<BR />
      4 And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of
      the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared
      all things that God had done with them.<BR />
      5 But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which
      believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and
      to command them to keep the law of Moses.<BR />
      6 And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of
      this matter.<BR />
      7 And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and
      said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while
      ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should
      hear the word of the gospel, and believe.<BR />
      8 And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving
      them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us;<BR />
      9 And put no difference between us and them, purifying their
      hearts by faith.<BR />
      10 Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck
      of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able
      to bear?<BR />
      11 But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
      we shall be saved, even as they.<BR />
      12 Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to
      Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had
      wrought among the Gentiles by them.<BR />

      16 And he divided the three hundred men into three companies,
      and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers,
      and lamps within the pitchers.<BR />
      17 And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold,
      when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as
      I do, so shall ye do.<BR />
      18 When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then
      blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and
      say, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.<BR />
      19 So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto
      the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch;
      and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets,
      and brake the pitchers that were in their hands.<BR />
      20 And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers,
      and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their
      right hands to blow withal: and they cried, The sword of the
      LORD, and of Gideon.<BR />
      21 And they stood every man in his place round about the camp:
      and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.<BR />
      22 And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set
      every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the
      host: and the host fled to Beth-shittah in Zererath, and to the
      border of Abel-meholah, unto Tabbath.<BR />
      23 And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of
      Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued
      after the Midianites.<BR />
      24 And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying,
      Come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters
      unto Beth-barah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered
      themselves together, and took the waters unto Beth-barah and
      Jordan.<BR />
      25 And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb;
      and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at
      the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads
      of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.<BR />

      36 And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with
      him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.<BR />
      37 And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when
      she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought
      an alabaster box of ointment,<BR />
      38 And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash
      his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her
      head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.<BR />
      39 Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake
      within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would
      have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth
      him: for she is a sinner.<BR />
      40 And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat
      to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.<BR />
      41 There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one
      owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.<BR />
      42 And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them
      both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?<BR />
      43 Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave
      most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.<BR />
      44 And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou
      this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water
      for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped
      them with the hairs of her head.<BR />
      45 Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came
      in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.<BR />
      46 My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath
      anointed my feet with ointment.<BR />
      47 Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven;
      for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same
      loveth little.<BR />
      48 And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.<BR />
      49 And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves,
      Who is this that forgiveth sins also?<BR />
      50 And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in
      peace.<BR />

      15 In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on
      the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also
      wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they
      brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against
      them in the day wherein they sold victuals.<BR />
      16 There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish,
      and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children
      of Judah, and in Jerusalem.<BR />
      17 Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them,
      What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?<BR />
      18 Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this
      evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon
      Israel by profaning the sabbath.<BR />
      19 And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began
      to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should
      be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after
      the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that
      there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.<BR />
      20 So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without
      Jerusalem once or twice.<BR />
      21 Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge
      ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you.
      From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.<BR />
      22 And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves,
      and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the
      sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and
      spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy.<BR />

      17 Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped
      in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together,
      and encamped in Mizpeh.<BR />
      29 Then the spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed
      over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead,
      and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of
      Ammon.<BR />
      30 And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou
      shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands,<BR />
      31 Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors
      of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children
      of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD'S, and I will offer it up
      for a burnt offering.<BR />
      32 So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight
      against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.<BR />
      33 And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith,
      even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with
      a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued
      before the children of Israel.<BR />
      34 And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his
      daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances:
      and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor
      daughter.<BR />
      35 And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes,
      and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and
      thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth
      unto the LORD, and I cannot go back.<BR />
      36 And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy
      mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded
      out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance
      for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon.<BR />

      38 And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and
      she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon
      the mountains.<BR />
      39 And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned
      unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which
      he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,<BR />

      1 And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every
      city and village, preaching and showing the glad tidings of the
      kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,<BR />
      2 And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and
      infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,<BR />
      3 And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna,
      and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance.<BR />
      4 And when much people were gathered together, and were come
      to him out of every city, he spake by a parable:<BR />
      5 A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell
      by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the
      air devoured it.<BR />
      6 And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up,
      it withered away, because it lacked moisture.<BR />
      7 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it,
      and choked it.<BR />
      8 And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit
      an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried,
      He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.<BR />
      9 And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable
      be?<BR />
      10 And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of
      the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they
      might not see, and hearing they might not understand.<BR />
      11 Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.<BR />
      12 Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the
      devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they
      should believe and be saved.<BR />
      13 They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive
      the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while
      believe, and in time of temptation fall away.<BR />
      14 And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they
      have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and
      pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.<BR />
      15 But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and
      good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit
      with patience.<BR />

      Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no
      such commandment:<BR />
      25 It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to
      send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,<BR />
      26 Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord
      Jesus Christ.<BR />
      27 We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell
      you the same things by mouth.<BR />
      28 For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon
      you no greater burden than these necessary things;<BR />
      29 That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood,
      and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if
      ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.<BR />
      30 So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when
      they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the
      epistle:<BR />

      when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.<BR />
      32 And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted
      the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.<BR />
      33 And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go
      in peace from the brethren unto the apostles.<BR />
      34 Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.<BR />
      35 Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and
      preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.<BR />
