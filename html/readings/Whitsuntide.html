      1 LOVE righteousness, ye that be judges of the earth: think of
      the Lord with a good (heart,) and in simplicity of heart seek
      him.<BR />
      2 For he will be found of them that tempt him not; and sheweth
      himself unto such as do not distrust him.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor2384358"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">3 For
      froward thoughts separate from God: and his power, when it is
      tried, reproveth the unwise.<BR />
      4 For into a malicious soul wisdom shall not enter; nor dwell
      in the body that is subject unto sin.<BR />
      5 For the holy spirit of discipline will flee deceit, and remove
      from thoughts that are without understanding, and will not abide
      when unrighteousness cometh in.<BR />
      6 For wisdom is a loving spirit; and will not acquit a blasphemer
      of his words: for God is witness of his reins, and a true beholder
      of his heart, and a hearer of his tongue.<BR />
      7 For the Spirit of the Lord filleth the world: and that which
      containeth all things hath knowledge of the voice.<BR />

      20 Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that
      in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.<BR />

      when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem,
      worship the Father.<BR />
      22 Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for
      salvation is of the Jews.<BR />
      23 But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers

      Wisdom 7:22-8:1</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      22 For wisdom, which is the worker of all things, taught me:
      for in her is an understanding spirit, holy, one only, manifold,
      subtil, lively, clear, undefiled, plain, not subject to hurt,
      loving the thing that is good, quick, which cannot be letted,
      ready to do good,<BR />
      23 Kind to man, stedfast, sure, free from care, having all power,
      overseeing all things, and going through all understanding, pure,
      and most subtil, spirits.<BR />
      24 For wisdom is more moving than any motion- she passeth and
      goeth through all things by reason of her pureness.<BR />
      25 For she is the breath of the power of God, and a pure influence
      flowing from the glory of the Almighty: therefore can no defiled
      thing fall into her.<BR />
      26 For she is the brightness of the everlasting light, the unspotted
      mirror of the power of God, and the image of his goodness.<BR />
      27 And being but one, she can do all things: and remaining in
      herself, she maketh all things new: and in all ages entering
      into holy souls, she maketh them friends of God, and prophets.<BR />
      28 For God loveth none but him that dwelleth with wisdom.<BR />
      29 For she is more beautiful than the sun, and above all the
      order of stars: being compared with the light, she is found before
      it.<BR />

      1 Corinthians 2</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency
      of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.<BR />
      2 For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus
      Christ, and him crucified.<BR />
      3 And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.<BR />
      4 And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words
      of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:<BR />
      5 That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but
      in the power of God.<BR />
      6 Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not
      the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that
      come to nought:<BR />
      7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden
      wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:<BR />
      8 Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they
      known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor2391166"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">9 But
      as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have
      entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared
      for them that love him.<BR />
      10 But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the
      Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.<BR />
      11 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit
      of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no
      man, but the Spirit of God.<BR />
      12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the
      spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are
      freely given to us of God.<BR />
      13 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom
      teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual
      things with spiritual.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor2392266"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">14 But
      the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God:
      for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them,
      because they are spiritually discerned.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor2400983"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">15 But
      he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged
      of no man.<BR />
      16 For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct
      him? But we have the mind of Christ.<BR />

      13 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived
      that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and
      they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.<BR />
      14 And beholding the man which was healed standing with them,
      they could say nothing against it.<BR />

      What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle

      2 Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb
      idols, even as ye were led.<BR />
      3 Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by
      the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can
      say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.<BR />
      4 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.<BR />
      5 And there are differences of administrations, but the same

      the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit
      withal.<BR />
      8 For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another
      the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;<BR />
      9 To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of
      healing by the same Spirit;<BR />
      10 To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to
      another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues;
      to another the interpretation of tongues:<BR />
      11 But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing
      to every man severally as he will.<BR />
      12 For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the
      members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is
      Christ.<BR />
      13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether
      we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have
      been all made to drink into one Spirit.<BR />

      elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon
      them, they prophesied, and did not cease.<BR />
      26 But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of
      the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit
      rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but
      went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the

      and Medad do prophesy in the camp.<BR />

      young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.<BR />

      that all the LORD'S people were prophets, and that the LORD would
      put his spirit upon them!<BR />

      1 And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency
      of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.<BR />
      2 For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus
      Christ, and him crucified.<BR />
      3 And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.<BR />
      4 And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words
      of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:<BR />
      5 That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but
      in the power of God.<BR />
      6 Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not
      the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that
      come to nought:<BR />
      7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden
      wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:<BR />
      8 Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they
      known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.<BR />
      9 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither
      have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath
      prepared for them that love him.<BR />
      10 But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the
      Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.<BR />
      11 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit
      of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no
      man, but the Spirit of God.<BR />
      12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the
      spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are
      freely given to us of God.<BR />
      13 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom
      teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual
      things with spiritual.<BR />
      14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit
      of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know
      them, because they are spiritually discerned.<BR />

      12 And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders
      wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord
      in Solomon's porch.<BR />
      13 And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the
      people magnified them.<BR />
      14 And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes
      both of men and women.)<BR />
      15 Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets,
      and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow
      of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.<BR />
      16 There came also a multitude out of the cities round about
      unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed
      with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.<BR />
      17 Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with
      him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with
      indignation,<BR />
      18 And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the
      common prison.<BR />
      19 But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors,
      and brought them forth, and said,<BR />

      21 And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early
      in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they
      that were with him, and called the council together, and all
      the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison
      to have them brought.<BR />
      22 But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison,

      23 Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and
      the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had

      this would grow.<BR />
      25 Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom
      ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the
      people.<BR />
      26 Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them
      without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should

      Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought
      to obey God rather than men.<BR />
      30 The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged
      on a tree.<BR />
      31 Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and
      a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness
      of sins.<BR />
      32 And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the
      Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.<BR />
      33 When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took
      counsel to slay them.<BR />
      34 Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named
      Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the
      people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;<BR />
      35 And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves
      what ye intend to do as touching these men.<BR />
      36 For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to
      be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined
      themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were
      scattered, and brought to nought.<BR />
      37 After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the
      taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished;
      and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.<BR />
      38 And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them
      alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come
      to nought:<BR />
      39 But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye
      be found even to fight against God.<BR />
      40 And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles,
      and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in
      the name of Jesus, and let them go.<BR />

      The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath
      anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent
      me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives,
      and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;<BR />
      2 To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of
      vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;<BR />
      3 To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them
      beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of
      praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called
      trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might
      be glorified.<BR />
      4 And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the
      former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the
      desolations of many generations.<BR />
      5 And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons
      of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.<BR />
      6 But ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD: men shall call
      you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the
      Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.<BR />
      7 For your shame ye shall have double; and for confusion they
      shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they
      shall possess the double: everlasting joy shall be unto them.<BR />
      8 For I the LORD love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt offering;
      and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting
      covenant with them.<BR />
      9 And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their
      offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge
      them, that they are the seed which the LORD hath blessed.<BR />

      1 Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some
      others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation
      from you?<BR />
      2 Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of
      all men:<BR />
      3 Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of
      Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit
      of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables
      of the heart.<BR />
      4 And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:<BR />
      5 Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing
      as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;<BR />
      6 Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament;
      not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth,
      but the spirit giveth life.<BR />
      7 But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones,
      was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly
      behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which
      glory was to be done away:<BR />
      8 How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?<BR />
      9 For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more
      doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.<BR />
      10 For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this
      respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.<BR />
      11 For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that
      which remaineth is glorious.<BR />
      12 Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness
      of speech:<BR />
      13 And not as Moses, which put a veil over his face, that the
      children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that
      which is abolished:<BR />
      14 But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth
      the same veil untaken away in the reading of the old testament;
      which veil is done away in Christ.<BR />
      15 But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon
      their heart.<BR />
      16 Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall
      be taken away.<BR />
      17 Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord
      is, there is liberty.<BR />

      1 And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied,
      there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews,
      because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.<BR />
      2 Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto
      them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word
      of God, and serve tables.<BR />
      3 Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest
      report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint
      over this business.<BR />
      4 But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the
      ministry of the word.<BR />
      5 And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose
      Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip,
      and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas
      a proselyte of Antioch:<BR />
      6 Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed,
      they laid their hands on them.<BR />
      7 And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples
      multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests
      were obedient to the faith.<BR />
      8 And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and
      miracles among the people.<BR />
      9 Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called
      the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians,
      and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.<BR />
      10 And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit
      by which he spake.<BR />
      11 Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak
      blasphemous words against Moses, and against God.<BR />
      12 And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes,
      and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council,<BR />
      13 And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not
      to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:<BR />
      14 For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall
      destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses
      delivered us.<BR />
