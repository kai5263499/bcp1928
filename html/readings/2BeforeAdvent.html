      First Lesson<BR />
      Isaiah 2:6-19</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      6 Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob,
      because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers
      like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children
      of strangers.<BR />
      7 Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there
      any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses,
      neither is there any end of their chariots:<BR />
      8 Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of
      their own hands, that which their own fingers have made:<BR />
      9 And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself:
      therefore forgive them not.<BR />
      10 Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of
      the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty.<BR />
      11 The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness
      of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted
      in that day.<BR />
      12 For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be upon every one that
      is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and
      he shall be brought low:<BR />
      13 And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted
      up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,<BR />
      14 And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that
      are lifted up,<BR />
      15 And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall,<BR />
      16 And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant
      pictures.<BR />
      17 And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness
      of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall be exalted
      in that day.<BR />
      18 And the idols he shall utterly abolish.<BR />
      19 And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the
      caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of
      his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Second Lesson<BR />
      Matthew 25:14-29</B><BR />
      14 For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far
      country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them
      his goods.<BR />
      15 And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to
      another one; to every man according to his several ability; and
      straightway took his journey.<BR />
      16 Then he that had received the five talents went and traded
      with the same, and made them other five talents.<BR />
      17 And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other
      two.<BR />
      18 But he that had received one went and digged in the earth,
      and hid his lord's money.<BR />
      19 After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth
      with them.<BR />
      20 And so he that had received five talents came and brought
      other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five
      talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.<BR />
      21 His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful
      servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make
      thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.<BR />
      22 He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord,
      thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two
      other talents beside them.<BR />
      23 His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant;
      thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler
      over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.<BR />
      24 Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord,
      I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast
      not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:<BR />
      25 And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth:
      lo, there thou hast that is thine.<BR />
      26 His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful
      servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather
      where I have not strawed:<BR />
      27 Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers,
      and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.<BR />
      28 Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which
      hath ten talents.<BR />
      29 For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall
      have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away
      even that which he hath.<BR />

<BR />
      First Lesson<BR />
      Genesis 19:1-3, 12-17, 24-28</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in
      the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them;
      and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;<BR />
      2 And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into
      your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet,
      and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said,
      Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.<BR />
      3 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him,
      and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did
      bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.<BR />
      12 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son-in-law,
      and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in
      the city, bring them out of this place:<BR />
      13 For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is
      waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent
      us to destroy it.<BR />
      14 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married
      his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the
      LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked
      unto his sons in law.<BR />
      15 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,
      saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are
      here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.<BR />
      16 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and
      upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters;
      the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth,
      and set him without the city.<BR />
      17 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad,
      that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither
      stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou
      be consumed.<BR />
      24 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone
      and fire from the LORD out of heaven;<BR />
      25 And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all
      the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.<BR />
      26 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a
      pillar of salt.<BR />
      27 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where
      he stood before the LORD:<BR />
      28 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the
      land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country
      went up as the smoke of a furnace.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Second Lesson<BR />
      Luke 17:20-37</B><BR />
      20 And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom
      of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of
      God cometh not with observation:<BR />
      21 Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold,
      the kingdom of God is within you.<BR />
      22 And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye
      shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye
      shall not see it.<BR />
      23 And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not
      after them, nor follow them.<BR />
      24 For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part
      under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall
      also the Son of man be in his day.<BR />
      25 But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this
      generation.<BR />
      26 And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the
      days of the Son of man.<BR />
      27 They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given
      in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and
      the flood came, and destroyed them all.<BR />
      28 Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat,
      they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;<BR />
      29 But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire
      and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.<BR />
      30 Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.<BR />
      31 In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his
      stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and
      he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.<BR />
      32 Remember Lot's wife.<BR />
      33 Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever
      shall lose his life shall preserve it.<BR />
      34 I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed;
      the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.<BR />
      35 Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken,
      and the other left.<BR />
      36 Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and
      the other left.<BR />
      37 And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said
      unto them, Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be
      gathered together.<BR />

      Lamentations 1:1-6<BR />
      1 How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how
      is she become as a widow! she that was great among the nations,
      and princess among the provinces, how is she become tributary!<BR />
      2 She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks:
      among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: all her friends
      have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.<BR />
      3 Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because
      of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth
      no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.<BR />
      4 The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn
      feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins
      are afflicted, and she is in bitterness.<BR />
      5 Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the
      LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions:
      her children are gone into captivity before the enemy.<BR />
      6 And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her
      princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they
      are gone without strength before the pursuer.<BR />
<BR />
      </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Second Lesson<BR />
      1 Peter 3:13-22</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      13 And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that
      which is good?<BR />
      14 But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye:
      and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;<BR />
      15 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always
      to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the
      hope that is in you with meekness and fear:<BR />
      16 Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of
      you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse
      your good conversation in Christ.<BR />
      17 For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer
      for well doing, than for evil doing.<BR />
      18 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for
      the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death
      in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:<BR />
      19 By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;<BR />
      20 Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering
      of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a-preparing,
      wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.<BR />
      21 The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save
      us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer
      of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus
      Christ:<BR />
      22 Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God;
      angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.<BR />

      First Lesson<BR />
      Wisdom 1:1-7 </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Love righteousness, ye that be judges of the earth: think of
      the Lord with a good (heart,) and in simplicity of heart seek
      him.<BR />
      2 For he will be found of them that tempt him not; and sheweth
      himself unto such as do not distrust him.<BR />
      3 For froward thoughts separate from God: and his power, when
      it is tried, reproveth the unwise.<BR />
      4 For into a malicious soul wisdom shall not enter; nor dwell
      in the body that is subject unto sin<BR />
      5 For the holy spirit of discipline will flee deceit, and remove
      from thoughts that are without understanding, and will not abide
      when unrighteousness cometh in.<BR />
      6 For wisdom is a loving spirit; and will not acquit a blasphemer
      of his words: for God is witness of his reins, and a true beholder
      of his heart, and a hearer of his tongue.<BR />
      7 For the Spirit of the Lord filleth the world: and that which
      containeth all things hath knowledge of the voice.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Second Lesson<BR />
      1 Thessalonians 5:12-28</B><BR />
      12 And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among
      you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;<BR />
      13 And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake.
      And be at peace among yourselves.<BR />
      14 Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort
      the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.<BR />
      15 See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever
      follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all
      men.<BR />
      16 Rejoice evermore.<BR />
      17 Pray without ceasing.<BR />
      18 In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in
      Christ Jesus concerning you.<BR />
      19 Quench not the Spirit.<BR />
      20 Despise not prophesyings.<BR />
      21 Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.<BR />
      22 Abstain from all appearance of evil.<BR />
      23 And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray
      God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless
      unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.<BR />
      24 Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.<BR />
      25 Brethren, pray for us.<BR />
      26 Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.<BR />
      27 I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all
      the holy brethren.<BR />
      28 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.<BR />

      First Lesson<BR />
      Lamentations 1:15-22</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      15 The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the
      midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my
      young men: the Lord hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of
      Judah, as in a winepress.<BR />
      16 For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with
      water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far
      from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.<BR />
      17 Zion spreadeth forth her hands, and there is none to comfort
      her: the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob, that his adversaries
      should be round about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman
      among them.<BR />
      18 The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment:
      hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my virgins
      and my young men are gone into captivity.<BR />
      19 I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and
      mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought
      their meat to relieve their souls.<BR />
      20 Behold, O LORD; for I am in distress: my bowels are troubled;
      mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled:
      abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is as death.<BR />
      21 They have heard that I sigh: there is none to comfort me:
      all mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that
      thou hast done it: thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called,
      and they shall be like unto me.<BR />
      22 Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them,
      as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs
      are many, and my heart is faint.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Second Lesson<BR />
      1 Peter 4:1-6 </B><BR />
      1 Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh,
      arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath
      suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;<BR />
      2 That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh
      to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.<BR />
      3 For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought
      the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts,
      excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:<BR />
      4 Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to
      the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:<BR />
      5 Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick
      and the dead.<BR />
      6 For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that
      are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh,
      but live according to God in the spirit.<BR />

      First Lesson<BR />
      Wisdom 6:1-11 </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 HEAR therefore, O ye kings, and understand; learn, ye that
      be judges of the ends of the earth.<BR />
      2 Give ear, ye that rule the people, and glory in the multitude
      of nations.<BR />
      3 For power is given you of the Lord, and sovereignty from the
      Highest, who shall try your works, and search out your counsels.<BR />
      4 Because, being ministers of his kingdom, ye have not judged
      a right, nor kept the law, nor walked after the counsel of God<BR />
      5 Horribly and speedily shall he come upon you: for a sharp judgment
      shall be to them that be in high places.<BR />
      6 For mercy will soon pardon the meanest: but mighty men shall
      be mightily tormented.<BR />
      7 For he which is Lord over all shall fear no man's person, neither
      shall he stand in awe of any man's greatness: for he hath made
      the small and great, and careth for all alike<BR />
      8 But a sore trial shall come upon the mighty.<BR />
      9 Unto you therefore, O kings, do I speak, that ye may learn
      wisdom, and not fall away.<BR />
      10 For they that keep holiness holily shall be judged holy: and
      they that have learned such things shall find what to answer.<BR />
      11 Wherefore set your affection upon my words; desire them, and
      ye shall be instructed.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Second Lesson<BR />
      2 Thessalonians 1</B><BR />
      1 Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians
      in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:<BR />
      2 Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord
      Jesus Christ.<BR />
      3 We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is
      meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity
      of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;<BR />
      4 So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for
      your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations
      that ye endure:<BR />
      5 Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God,
      that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which
      ye also suffer:<BR />
      6 Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation
      to them that trouble you;<BR />
      7 And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus
      shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,<BR />
      8 In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God,
      and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:<BR />
      9 Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the
      presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;<BR />
      10 When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be
      admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among
      you was believed) in that day.<BR />
      11 Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would
      count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure
      of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:<BR />
      12 That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in
      you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the
      Lord Jesus Christ.<BR />

      First Lesson<BR />
      Lamentations 2:1-10 </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud
      in his anger, and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty
      of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his
      anger!<BR />
      2 The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and
      hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong
      holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought them down to
      the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.<BR />
      3 He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel:
      he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and
      he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth
      round about.<BR />
      4 He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right
      hand as an adversary, and slew all that were pleasant to the
      eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out
      his fury like fire.<BR />
      5 The Lord was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath
      swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds,
      and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.<BR />
      6 And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were
      of a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the
      LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten
      in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the
      king and the priest.<BR />
      7 The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary,
      he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her
      palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the LORD, as
      in the day of a solemn feast.<BR />
      8 The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter
      of Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn
      his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the
      wall to lament; they languished together.<BR />
      9 Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken
      her bars: her king and her princes are among the Gentiles: the
      law is no more; her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.<BR />
      10 The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, and
      keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have
      girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang
      down their heads to the ground.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Second Lesson<BR />
      1 Peter 4:7-11</B><BR />
      7 But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober,
      and watch unto prayer.<BR />
      8 And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves:
      for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.<BR />
      9 Use hospitality one to another without grudging.<BR />
      10 As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the
      same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of
      God.<BR />
      11 If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if
      any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth:
      that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ,
      to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.<BR />

      First Lesson<BR />
      Wisdom 6:12-21</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      12 Wisdom is glorious, and never fadeth away: yea, she is easily
      seen of them that love her, and found of such as seek her.<BR />
      I3 She preventeth them that desire her, in making herself first
      known unto them.<BR />
      14 Whoso seeketh her early shall have no great travail: for he
      shall find her sitting at his doors.<BR />
      15 To think therefore upon her is perfection of wisdom: and whoso
      watcheth for her shall quickly be without care.<BR />
      16 For she goeth about seeking such as are worthy of her, sheweth
      herself favourably unto them in the ways, and meeteth them in
      every thought.<BR />
      17 For the very true beginning of her is the desire of discipline;
      and the care of discipline is love;<BR />
      18 And love is the keeping of her laws; and the giving heed unto
      her laws is the assurance of incorruption;<BR />
      19 And incorruption maketh us near unto God:<BR />
      20 Therefore the desire of wisdom bringeth to a kingdom.<BR />
      21 If your delight be then in thrones and sceptres, O ye kings
      of the people, honour wisdom, that ye may reign for evermore.<BR />
<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Second Lesson<BR />
      2 Thessalonians 2:1-12</B><BR />
      1 Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus
      Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,<BR />
      2 That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither
      by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the
      day of Christ is at hand.<BR />
      3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not
      come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of
      sin be revealed, the son of perdition;<BR />
      4 Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called
      God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the
      temple of God, showing himself that he is God.<BR />
      5 Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you
      these things?<BR />
      6 And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed
      in his time.<BR />
      7 For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who
      now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.<BR />
      8 And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall
      consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with
      the brightness of his coming:<BR />
      9 Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all
      power and signs and lying wonders,<BR />
      10 And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that
      perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that
      they might be saved.<BR />
      11 And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that
      they should believe a lie:<BR />
      12 That they all might be damned who believed not the truth,
      but had pleasure in unrighteousness.<BR />

      Lamentations 4:1-6, 9</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 How is the gold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed!
      the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every
      street.<BR />
      2 The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are
      they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the
      potter!<BR />
      3 Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to
      their young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel,
      like the ostriches in the wilderness.<BR />
      4 The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his
      mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, and no man breaketh
      it unto them.<BR />
      5 They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets:
      they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.<BR />
      6 For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people
      is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was
      overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.<BR />
      9 They that be slain with the sword are better than they that
      be slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for
      want of the fruits of the field.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Second Lesson<BR />
      1 Peter 4:12-19</B><BR />
      12 Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which
      is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:<BR />
      13 But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings;
      that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with
      exceeding joy.<BR />
      14 If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye;
      for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their
      part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.<BR />
      15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or
      as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.<BR />
      16 Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed;
      but let him glorify God on this behalf.<BR />
      17 For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house
      of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of
      them that obey not the gospel of God?<BR />
      18 And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly
      and the sinner appear?<BR />
      19 Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God
      commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto
      a faithful Creator.<BR />

      First Lesson<BR />
      Wisdom 7:7-14</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      7 Wherefore I prayed, and understanding was given me: I called
      upon God, and the spirit of wisdom came to me.<BR />
      8 I preferred her before sceptres and thrones, and esteemed riches
      nothing in comparison of her.<BR />
      9 Neither compared I unto her any precious stone, because all
      gold in respect of her is as a little sand, and silver shall
      be counted as clay before her.<BR />
      10 I loved her above health and beauty, and chose to have her
      instead of light: for the light that cometh from her never goeth
      out.<BR />
      11 All good things together came to me with her, and innumerable
      riches in her hands.<BR />
      12 And I rejoiced in them all, because wisdom goeth before them:
      and I knew not that she was the mother of them.<BR />
      I3 I learned diligently, and do communicate her liberally: I
      do not hide her riches.<BR />
      14 For she is a treasure unto men that never faileth: which they
      that use become the friends of God, being commended for the gifts
      that come from learning.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Second Lesson<BR />
      2 Thessalonians 2:13-3:5</B><BR />
      13 But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brethren
      beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen
      you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief
      of the truth:<BR />
      14 Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of
      the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.<BR />
      15 Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which
      ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.<BR />
      16 Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father,
      which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation
      and good hope through grace,<BR />
      17 Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and
      work.<BR />
      1 Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may
      have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:<BR />
      2 And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men:
      for all men have not faith.<BR />
      3 But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep
      you from evil.<BR />
      4 And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both
      do and will do the things which we command you.<BR />
      5 And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into
      the patient waiting for Christ.<BR />

      Lamentations 4:11-20</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      11 The LORD hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his
      fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured
      the foundations thereof.<BR />
      12 The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world,
      would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should
      have entered into the gates of Jerusalem.<BR />
      13 For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests,
      that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her,<BR />
      14 They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they have
      polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their
      garments.<BR />
      15 They cried unto them, Depart ye; It is unclean; depart, depart,
      touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among
      the heathen, They shall no more sojourn there.<BR />
      16 The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard
      them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured
      not the elders.<BR />
      17 As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our
      watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us.<BR />
      18 They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our
      end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.<BR />
      19 Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven:
      they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in
      the wilderness.<BR />
      20 The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was
      taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall
      live among the heathen.<BR />
      Second Lesson<BR />
      1 Peter 5:1-7<BR />
      1 The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder,
      and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker
      of the glory that shall be revealed:<BR />
      2 Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight
      thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre,
      but of a ready mind;<BR />
      3 Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being examples
      to the flock.<BR />
      4 And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive
      a crown of glory that fadeth not away.<BR />
      5 Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea,
      all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility:
      for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.<BR />
      6 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that
      he may exalt you in due time:<BR />
      7 Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.<BR />

      Wisdom 7:15-22a</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      15 God hath granted me to speak as I would, and to conceive as
      is meet for the things that are given me: because it is he that
      leadeth unto wisdom, and directeth the wise.<BR />
      16 For in his hand are both we and our words; all wisdom also,
      and knowledge of workmanship.<BR />
      17 For he hath given me certain knowledge of the things that
      are, namely, to know how the world was made, and the operation
      of the elements:<BR />
      18 The beginning, ending, and midst of the times: the alterations
      of the turning of the sun, and the change of seasons:<BR />
      19 The circuits of years, and the positions of stars:<BR />
      20 The natures of living creatures, and the furies of wild beasts:
      the violence of winds, and the reasonings of men: the diversities
      of plants, and the virtues of roots:<BR />
      21 And all such things as are either secret or manifest, them
      I know.<BR />
      22 For wisdom, which is the worker of all things, taught me.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Second Lesson<BR />
      2 Thessalonians 3:6-18</B><BR />
      6 Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus
      Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh
      disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of
      us.<BR />
      7 For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved
      not ourselves disorderly among you;<BR />
      8 Neither did we eat any man's bread for nought; but wrought
      with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable
      to any of you:<BR />
      9 Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an example
      unto you to follow us.<BR />
      10 For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that
      if any would not work, neither should he eat.<BR />
      11 For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly,
      working not at all, but are busybodies.<BR />
      12 Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus
      Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.<BR />
      13 But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.<BR />
      14 And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that
      man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.<BR />
      15 Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.<BR />
      16 Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all
      means. The Lord be with you all.<BR />
      17 The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token
      in every epistle: so I write.<BR />
      18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.<BR />

      6 We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians,
      to be satisfied with bread.<BR />
      7 Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their
      iniquities.<BR />
      8 Servants have ruled over us: there is none that doth deliver
      us out of their hand.<BR />
      9 We gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the
      sword of the wilderness.<BR />
      10 Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine.<BR />
      11 They ravished the women in Zion, and the maids in the cities
      of Judah.<BR />
      12 Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were
      not honoured.<BR />
      13 They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under
      the wood.<BR />
      14 The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their
      music.<BR />
      15 The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning.<BR />
      16 The crown is fallen from our head: woe unto us, that we have
      sinned!<BR />
      17 For this our heart is faint; for these things our eyes are
      dim.<BR />
      18 Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes
      walk upon it.<BR />
      19 Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation
      to generation.<BR />
      20 Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so
      long time?<BR />
      21 Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew
      our days as of old.<BR />
      22 But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against
      us.<BR />

      <B>Second Lesson<BR />
      1 Peter 5:8-14</B><BR />
      8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as
      a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:<BR />
      9 Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions
      are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.<BR />
      10 But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal
      glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make
      you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.<BR />
      11 To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.<BR />
      12 By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I
      have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is
      the true grace of God wherein ye stand.<BR />
      13 The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you,
      saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son.<BR />
      14 Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with
      you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.<BR />

      First Lesson<BR />
      Wisdom 7:22-8:1</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      22 For wisdom, which is the worker of all things, taught me:
      for in her is an understanding spirit, holy, one only, manifold,
      subtil, lively, clear, undefiled, plain, not subject to hurt,
      loving the thing that is good, quick, which cannot be letted,
      ready to do good,<BR />
      23 Kind to man, stedfast, sure, free from care, having all power,
      overseeing all things, and going through all understanding, pure,
      and most subtil, spirits.<BR />
      24 For wisdom is more moving than any motion: she passeth and
      goeth through all things by reason of her pureness.<BR />
      25 For she is the breath of the power of God, and a pure influence
      flowing from the glory of the Almighty: therefore can no defiled
      thing fall into her.<BR />
      26 For she is the brightness of the everlasting light, the unspotted
      mirror of the power of God, and the image of his goodness.<BR />
      27 And being but one, she can do all things: and remaining in
      herself, she maketh all things new: and in all ages entering
      into holy souls, she maketh them friends of God, and prophets.<BR />
      28 For God loveth none but him that dwelleth with wisdom.<BR />
      29 For she is more beautiful than the sun, and above all the
      order of stars: being compared with the light, she is found before
      it.<BR />
      30 For after this cometh night: but vice shall not prevail against
      wisdom.<BR />
      1 Wisdom reacheth from one end to another mightily: and sweetly
      doth she order all things.<BR />
<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Second Lesson<BR />
      Jude </B><BR />
      1 Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to
      them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in
      Jesus Christ, and called:<BR />
      2 Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.<BR />
      3 Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the
      common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and
      exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which
      was once delivered unto the saints.<BR />
      4 For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before
      of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the
      grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord
      God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.<BR />
      5 I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew
      this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land
      of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.<BR />
      6 And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left
      their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains
      under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.<BR />
      7 Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like
      manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after
      strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance
      of eternal fire.<BR />
      8 Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise
      dominion, and speak evil of dignities.<BR />
      9 Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he
      disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him
      a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.<BR />
      10 But these speak evil of those things which they know not:
      but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things
      they corrupt themselves.<BR />
      11 Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and
      ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished
      in the gainsaying of Core.<BR />
      12 These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast
      with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without
      water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without
      fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;<BR />
      13 Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering
      stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.<BR />
      14 And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these,
      saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,<BR />
      15 To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are
      ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have
      ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly
      sinners have spoken against him.<BR />
      16 These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own
      lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having
      men's persons in admiration because of advantage.<BR />
      17 But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before
      of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;<BR />
      18 How that they told you there should be mockers in the last
      time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.<BR />
      19 These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not
      the Spirit.<BR />
      20 But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy
      faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,<BR />
      21 Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy
      of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.<BR />
      22 And of some have compassion, making a difference:<BR />
      23 And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating
      even the garment spotted by the flesh.<BR />
      24 Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to
      present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding
      joy,<BR />
      25 To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion
      and power, both now and ever. Amen.</FONT></P>
