      1 Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came
      to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses'
      minister, saying,<BR />
      2 Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this
      Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give
      to them, even to the children of Israel.<BR />
      3 Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that
      have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.<BR />
      4 From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river,
      the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the
      great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor931757"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">5 There
      shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of
      thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will
      not fail thee, nor forsake thee.<BR />
      6 Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt
      thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their
      fathers to give them.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor932652"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">7 Only
      be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe
      to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded
      thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that
      thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.<BR />

      according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt
      make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.<BR />
      9 Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage;
      be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God
      is with thee whithersoever thou goest.<BR />

      1 Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ
      Jesus.<BR />
      2 And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses,
      the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach
      others also.<BR />
      3 Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus
      Christ.<BR />

      man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this
      life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.<BR />
      5 And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned,
      except he strive lawfully.<BR />
      6 The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the
      fruits.<BR />
      7 Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in
      all things.<BR />
      8 Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised
      from the dead according to my gospel:<BR />
      9 Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evildoer, even unto bonds;
      but the word of God is not bound.<BR />

      I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also
      obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.<BR />
      11 It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall
      also live with him:<BR />
      12 If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him,
      he also will deny us:<BR />
      13 If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny
      himself.<BR />

      1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.<BR />
      2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was
      upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the
      face of the waters.<BR />
      3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.<BR />
      4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the
      light from the darkness.<BR />
      5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.
      And the evening and the morning were the first day.<BR />
      6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the
      waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.<BR />
      7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were
      under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament:
      and it was so.<BR />
      8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the
      morning were the second day.<BR />
      9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together
      unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.<BR />
      10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together
      of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.<BR />
      11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding
      seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose
      seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.<BR />
      12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed
      after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in
      itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.<BR />
      13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.<BR />
      14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the
      heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for
      signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:<BR />
      15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven
      to give light upon the earth: and it was so.<BR />
      16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the
      day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars

      grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter
      growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king's mowings.<BR />
      2 And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating
      the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech
      thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.<BR />
      3 The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD.<BR />
      4 Thus hath the Lord GOD shown unto me: and, behold, the Lord
      GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep,
      and did eat up a part.<BR />
      5 Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall
      Jacob arise? for he is small.<BR />
      6 The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the
      Lord GOD.<BR />
      7 Thus he showed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall
      made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.<BR />
      8 And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said,
      A plumbline. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline
      in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them
      any more:<BR />
      1 Thus hath the Lord GOD shown unto me: and behold a basket of

      2 And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of

      14 And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:)
      and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and
      therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him.<BR />
      15 Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is
      a prophet, or as one of the prophets.<BR />
      16 But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I
      beheaded: he is risen from the dead.<BR />
      17 For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John,
      and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's
      wife: for he had married her.<BR />
      18 For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to
      have thy brother's wife.<BR />
      19 Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have
      killed him; but she could not:<BR />
      20 For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and
      an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many
      things, and heard him gladly.<BR />
      21 And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday
      made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates
      of Galilee;<BR />
      22 And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced,
      and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto
      the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it
      thee.<BR />
      23 And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I
      will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.<BR />
      24 And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I
      ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.<BR />
      25 And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and
      asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger
      the head of John the Baptist.<BR />

      his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,<BR />

      his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.<BR />

      and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel,
      two years before the earthquake.<BR />

      from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn,
      and the top of Carmel shall wither.<BR />
      3 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus,
      and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because
      they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:<BR />
      4 But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall
      devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.<BR />
      5 I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant
      from the plain of Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from
      the house of Eden: and the people of Syria shall go into captivity
      unto Kir, saith the LORD.<BR />
      13 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of the children
      of Ammon, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof;
      because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that
      they might enlarge their border:<BR />
      14 But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall
      devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of battle,
      with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind:<BR />
      15 And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes
      together, saith the LORD.<BR />
      1 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and

      11 But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached

      12 For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it,
      but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.<BR />
      13 For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews'

      mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions
      of my fathers.<BR />
      15 But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's
      womb, and called me by his grace,<BR />

      and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children;
      and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over
      thee.<BR />
      17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the
      voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded
      thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground
      for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of
      thy life;<BR />
      18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and
      thou shalt eat the herb of the field;<BR />
      19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return
      unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou
      art, and unto dust shalt thou return.<BR />
      20 And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother
      of all living.<BR />

      and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:<BR />
      23 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden,
      to till the ground from whence he was taken.<BR />
      24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the

      way, to keep the way of the tree of life.<BR />

      1 Hear ye this word which I take up against you, even a lamentation,
      O house of Israel.<BR />
      2 The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she
      is forsaken upon her land; there is none to raise her up.<BR />
      3 For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out by a thousand
      shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth by an hundred
      shall leave ten, to the house of Israel.<BR />
      4 For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me,
      and ye shall live:<BR />
      5 But seek not Beth-el, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to
      Beer-sheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Beth-el
      shall come to nought.<BR />
      6 Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire
      in the house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench
      it in Beth-el.<BR />
      7 Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness
      in the earth,<BR />
      8 Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth
      the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark
      with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth
      them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name:<BR />
      9 That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that
      the spoiled shall come against the fortress.<BR />
      10 They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him
      that speaketh uprightly.<BR />
      11 Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and
      ye take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn
      stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant
      vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.<BR />

      Galatians 3:10-18</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      10 For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse:
      for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in
      all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.<BR />
      11 But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God,
      it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.<BR />
      12 And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them
      shall live in them.<BR />
      13 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made
      a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth
      on a tree:<BR />
      14 That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through
      Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit
      through faith.<BR />
      15 Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but
      a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth,
      or addeth thereto.<BR />
      16 Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith
      not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed,
      which is Christ.<BR />
      17 And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before
      of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty
      years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise
      of none effect.<BR />
      18 For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise:
      but God gave it to Abraham by promise.<BR />
