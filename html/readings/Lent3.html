      1 Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments,
      which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that ye might
      do them in the land whither ye go to possess it:<BR />
      2 That thou mightest fear the LORD thy God, to keep all his statutes
      and his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son,
      and thy son's son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days
      may be prolonged.<BR />
      3 Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may
      be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the
      LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that
      floweth with milk and honey.<BR />
      4 Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:<BR />
      5 And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart,
      and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.<BR />
      6 And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in
      thine heart:<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor139672"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">7 And
      thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt
      talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou
      walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest
      up.<BR />
      8 And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they
      shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.<BR />
      9 And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and
      on thy gates.<BR />
      20 And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What
      mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which
      the LORD our God hath commanded you?<BR />
      21 Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen
      in Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty
      hand:<BR />
      22 And the LORD showed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon
      Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes:<BR />
      23 And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us
      in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.<BR />
      24 And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear
      the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve
      us alive, as it is at this day.<BR />

      And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual,
      but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.<BR />
      2 I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye
      were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor147853"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">3 For
      ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and
      strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?<BR />
      4 For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos;
      are ye not carnal?<BR />
      5 Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom
      ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?<BR />
      6 I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.<BR />
      7 So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that
      watereth; but God that giveth the increase.<BR />
      8 Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every
      man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.<BR />
      9 For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry,
      ye are God's building.<BR />
      10 According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a
      wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth
      thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor149578"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">11 For
      other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus
      Christ.<BR />
      12 Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious
      stones, wood, hay, stubble;<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor151716"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">13 Every
      man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare
      it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall
      try every man's work of what sort it is.<BR />
      14 If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he
      shall receive a reward.<BR />
      15 If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but
      he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.<BR />
      16 Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit
      of God dwelleth in you?<BR />
      17 If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy;
      for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.<BR />
      18 Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to
      be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be
      wise.<BR />
      19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For
      it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.<BR />
      20 And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that
      they are vain.<BR />
      21 Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;<BR />
      22 Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life,
      or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;<BR />
      23 And ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.<BR />

      4 For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me,
      and ye shall live:<BR />
      5 But seek not Beth-el, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to
      Beer-sheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Beth-el
      shall come to nought.<BR />
      6 Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire
      in the house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench
      it in Beth-el.<BR />
      7 Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness
      in the earth,<BR />
      8 Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth
      the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark
      with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth
      them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name:<BR />
      9 That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that
      the spoiled shall come against the fortress.<BR />
      10 They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him
      that speaketh uprightly.<BR />
      11 Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and
      ye take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn
      stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant
      vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor163865"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">12 For
      I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they
      afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the
      poor in the gate from their right.<BR />
      13 Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for
      it is an evil time.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor165030"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">14 Seek
      good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD, the God

      15 Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in
      the gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious

      This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil

      17 For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against
      the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that
      ye cannot do the things that ye would.<BR />

      Genesis 37:3-28, 36</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because
      he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many
      colours.<BR />
      4 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more
      than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably
      unto him.<BR />
      5 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and
      they hated him yet the more.<BR />
      6 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I
      have dreamed:<BR />
      7 For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo,
      my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves
      stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.<BR />
      8 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over
      us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated
      him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.<BR />
      9 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren,
      and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the
      sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.<BR />
      10 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his
      father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that
      thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed
      come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?<BR />
      11 And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.<BR />
      12 And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.<BR />
      13 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the
      flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he
      said to him, Here am I.<BR />
      14 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well
      with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word
      again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came
      to Shechem.<BR />
      15 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering
      in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?<BR />
      16 And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where
      they feed their flocks.<BR />
      17 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them
      say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren,
      and found them in Dothan.<BR />
      18 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto
      them, they conspired against him to slay him.<BR />
      19 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.<BR />
      20 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into
      some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him:
      and we shall see what will become of his dreams.<BR />
      21 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands;
      and said, Let us not kill him.<BR />
      22 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into
      this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him;
      that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his
      father again.<BR />
      23 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren,
      that they stripped Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours
      that was on him;<BR />
      24 And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was
      empty, there was no water in it.<BR />
      25 And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes
      and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead
      with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to
      carry it down to Egypt.<BR />
      26 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we
      slay our brother, and conceal his blood?<BR />
      27 Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not
      our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And
      his brethren were content.<BR />
      28 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew
      and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites
      for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.<BR />
      36 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer
      of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.<BR />

      15 But I have used none of these things: neither have I written

      against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto

      18 What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel,

      not my power in the gospel.<BR />
      19 For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself

      20 And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the
      Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that
      I might gain them that are under the law;<BR />

      17 And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running,
      and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I
      do that I may inherit eternal life?<BR />
      18 And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is
      none good but one, that is, God.<BR />
      19 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do
      not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not,
      Honour thy father and mother.<BR />

      up the cross, and follow me.<BR />
      22 And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for
      he had great possessions.<BR />

      the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth

      25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle,

      28 Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and

      1 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of
      the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king
      of Egypt.<BR />
      2 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against
      the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.<BR />
      3 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the
      guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.<BR />
      4 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and
      he served them: and they continued a season in ward.<BR />
      5 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in
      one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream,
      the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound
      in the prison.<BR />
      6 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon
      them, and, behold, they were sad.<BR />
      7 And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward
      of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly today?<BR />
      8 And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there
      is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations
      belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.<BR />
      9 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to
      him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;<BR />
      10 And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though
      it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof
      brought forth ripe grapes:<BR />
      11 And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and
      pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's
      hand.<BR />
      12 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it:
      The three branches are three days:<BR />
      13 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and
      restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's
      cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his
      butler.<BR />
      14 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and show
      kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh,
      and bring me out of this house:<BR />
      15 For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews:
      and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into
      the dungeon.<BR />
      16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good,
      he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had
      three white baskets on my head:<BR />
      17 And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats
      for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon
      my head.<BR />
      18 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof:
      The three baskets are three days:<BR />
      19 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from
      off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall
      eat thy flesh from off thee.<BR />
      20 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday,
      that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up
      the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his
      servants.<BR />
      21 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again;
      and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:<BR />
      22 But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to
      them.<BR />
      23 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.<BR />

      50 And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.<BR />
      51 And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that
      I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that
      I might receive my sight.<BR />
      52 And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee

      in the way.<BR />

      25 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one:
      God hath shown Pharaoh what he is about to do.<BR />
      26 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears
      are seven years: the dream is one.<BR />
      27 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after
      them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the
      east wind shall be seven years of famine.<BR />
      28 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God
      is about to do he showeth unto Pharaoh.<BR />
      29 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout
      all the land of Egypt:<BR />
      30 And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and
      all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the
      famine shall consume the land;<BR />
      31 And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of
      that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.<BR />
      32 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it
      is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly
      bring it to pass.<BR />
      33 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise,
      and set him over the land of Egypt.<BR />
      34 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the
      land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the
      seven plenteous years.<BR />
      35 And let them gather all the food of those good years that
      come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them
      keep food in the cities.<BR />
      36 And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven
      years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the
      land perish not through the famine.<BR />
      37 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the
      eyes of all his servants.<BR />
      38 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one
      as this is, a man in whom the spirit of God is?<BR />
      39 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shown
      thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:<BR />
      40 Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall
      all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater
      than thou.<BR />

      they bend their tongues like their bow for lies: but they are
      not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from
      evil to evil, and they know not me, saith the LORD.<BR />
      4 Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in
      any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every
      neighbour will walk with slanders.<BR />
      5 And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not
      speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies,
      and weary themselves to commit iniquity.<BR />
      6 Thine habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit
      they refuse to know me, saith the LORD.<BR />
      7 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt
      them, and try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my

      8 Their tongue is as an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit: one
      speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in heart
      he layeth his wait.<BR />
      9 Shall I not visit them for these things? saith the LORD: shall
      not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?<BR />
      10 For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and
      for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because
      they are burned up, so that none can pass through them; neither
      can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens

      1 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said
      unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?<BR />
      2 And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt:
      get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may
      live, and not die.<BR />
      3 And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.<BR />
      4 But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren;
      for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.<BR />
      5 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came:
      for the famine was in the land of Canaan.<BR />
      6 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that
      sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came,
      and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the
      earth.<BR />
      7 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself
      strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto
      them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan
      to buy food.<BR />
      8 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.<BR />
      9 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them,
      and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the
      land ye are come.<BR />
      10 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are
      thy servants come.<BR />
      11 We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are
      no spies.<BR />
      12 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the
      land ye are come.<BR />
      13 And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons
      of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is
      this day with our father, and one is not.<BR />
      14 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you,
      saying, Ye are spies:<BR />
      15 Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall
      not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.<BR />
      16 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall
      be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there
      be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye
      are spies.<BR />
      17 And he put them all together into ward three days.<BR />
      18 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live;
      for I fear God:<BR />
      19 If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the
      house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your
      houses:<BR />
      20 But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words
      be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.<BR />
      21 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning
      our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he
      besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress
      come upon us.<BR />
      22 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying,
      Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore,
      behold, also his blood is required.<BR />
      23 And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake
      unto them by an interpreter.<BR />
      24 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned
      to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon,
      and bound him before their eyes.<BR />
      25 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to
      restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision
      for the way: and thus did he unto them.<BR />
      26 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.<BR />
      29 And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan,<BR />
      35 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold,
      every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they
      and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.<BR />
      36 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved
      of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will
      take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.<BR />
      37 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons,
      if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will
      bring him to thee again.<BR />
      38 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother
      is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the
      way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs
      with sorrow to the grave.<BR />

      do show the Lord's death till he come.<BR />

      he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.<BR />
      3 And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.<BR />
      4 And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they
      cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully
      handled.<BR />
      5 And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others;
      beating some, and killing some.<BR />
      6 Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him
      also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.<BR />
      7 But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir;
      come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.<BR />
      8 And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the
      vineyard.<BR />
      9 What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come
      and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.<BR />
      10 And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders
      rejected is become the head of the corner:<BR />
      11 This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?<BR />
      12 And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people:
      for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and
      they left him, and went their way.<BR />

      1 And the famine was sore in the land.<BR />
      2 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which
      they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go
      again, buy us a little food.<BR />
      3 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest
      unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother
      be with you.<BR />
      4 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and
      buy thee food:<BR />
      5 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the
      man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother
      be with you.<BR />
      11 And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now,
      do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels,
      and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little
      honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:<BR />
      12 And take double money in your hand; and the money that was
      brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your
      hand; peradventure it was an oversight:<BR />
      13 Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:<BR />
      14 And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may
      send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved
      of my children, I am bereaved.<BR />
      15 And the men took that present, and they took double money
      in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt,
      and stood before Joseph.<BR />
      16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler
      of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready;
      for these men shall dine with me at noon.<BR />
      26 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which
      was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him
      to the earth.<BR />
      27 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father
      well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?<BR />
      28 And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health,
      he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.<BR />
      29 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his
      mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom
      ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my
      son.<BR />
      30 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother:
      and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber,
      and wept there.<BR />
      31 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself,
      and said, Set on bread.<BR />
      32 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves,
      and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves:
      because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for
      that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.<BR />
      33 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright,
      and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled
      one at another.<BR />
      34 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but
      Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And
      they drank, and were merry with him.<BR />

      1 Corinthians 12:1-11</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have
      you ignorant.<BR />
      2 Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb
      idols, even as ye were led.<BR />
      3 Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by
      the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can
      say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.<BR />
      4 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.<BR />
      5 And there are differences of administrations, but the same
      Lord.<BR />
      6 And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same
      God which worketh all in all.<BR />
      7 But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to
      profit withal.<BR />
      8 For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another
      the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;<BR />
      9 To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of
      healing by the same Spirit;<BR />
      10 To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to
      another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues;
      to another the interpretation of tongues:<BR />
      11 But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing
      to every man severally as he will.<BR />

      1 Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house
      of Israel:<BR />
      2 Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and
      be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed
      at them.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor601552"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">3 For
      the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out
      of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the
      axe.<BR />
      4 They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with
      nails and with hammers, that it move not.<BR />
      5 They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must
      needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them;
      for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.<BR />
      6 Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O LORD; thou art
      great, and thy name is great in might.<BR />
      7 Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth
      it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations,
      and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.<BR />

      founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the
      work of cunning men.<BR />
      10 But the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an
      everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the
      nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.<BR />
      11 Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the
      heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth,
      and from under these heavens.<BR />
      12 He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the
      world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his
      discretion.<BR />
      13 When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters
      in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the
      ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth
