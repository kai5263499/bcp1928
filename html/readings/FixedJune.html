      3 The rich hath great labour in gathering riches together; and
      when he resteth, he is filled with his delicates.<BR />
      4 The poor laboureth in his poor estate; and when he leaveth
      off, he is still needy.<BR />
      5 He that loveth gold shall not be justified, and he that followeth
      corruption shall have enough thereof.<BR />
      6 Gold hath been the ruin of many, and their destruction was
      present.<BR />
      7 It is a stumblingblock unto them that sacrifice unto it, and
      every fool shall be taken therewith.<BR />
      8 Blessed is the rich that is found without blemish, and hath
      not gone after gold.<BR />
      9 Who is he? and we will call him blessed: for wonderful things
      hath he done among his people.<BR />

      And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and
      of one soul: neither said any of them that aught of the things
      which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.<BR />
      33 And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection
      of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.<BR />
      34 Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many
      as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought
      the prices of the things that were sold,<BR />
      35 And laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution
      was made unto every man according as he had need.<BR />

      is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and
      of the country of Cyprus,<BR />

      26 And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself
      to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed
      not that he was a disciple.<BR />
      27 But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and
      declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that
      he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus
      in the name of Jesus.<BR />
      28 And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.<BR />
      29 And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed
      against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him.<BR />
      30 Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea,
      and sent him forth to Tarsus.<BR />
      31 Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee
      and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the
      Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.<BR />

      <B>Second Lesson<BR />
      ( in the Week of Trinity 1)<BR />
      Luke 14:25-35</B><BR />
      25 And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and
      said unto them,<BR />
      26 If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother,
      and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his
      own life also, he cannot be my disciple.<BR />
      27 And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me,
      cannot be my disciple.<BR />
      28 For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not
      down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient
      to finish it?<BR />
      29 Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not
      able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,<BR />
      30 Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.<BR />
      31 Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth
      not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand
      to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?<BR />
      32 Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth
      an ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace.<BR />
      33 So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all
      that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.<BR />
      34 Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith
      shall it be seasoned?<BR />
      35 It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill;
      but men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.<BR />

      Lesson<BR />
      Acts 14:8-28</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      8 And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet,
      being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked:<BR />
      9 The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and
      perceiving that he had faith to be healed,<BR />
      10 Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he
      leaped and walked.<BR />
      11 And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up
      their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are
      come down to us in the likeness of men.<BR />
      12 And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because
      he was the chief speaker.<BR />
      13 Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought
      oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice
      with the people.<BR />
      14 Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they
      rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,<BR />
      15 And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men
      of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should
      turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven,
      and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein:<BR />
      16 Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own
      ways.<BR />
      17 Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that
      he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons,
      filling our hearts with food and gladness. 18 And with these
      sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not
      done sacrifice unto them.<BR />
      19 And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium,
      who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew him out
      of the city, supposing he had been dead.<BR />
      20 Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up,
      and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas
      to Derbe.<BR />
      21 And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had
      taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and
      Antioch,<BR />
      22 Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them
      to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation
      enter into the kingdom of God.<BR />
      23 And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and
      had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on
      whom they believed.<BR />
      24 And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to
      Pamphylia.<BR />
      25 And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down
      into Attalia:<BR />
      26 And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended
      to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor303270"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">27 And
      when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they
      rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened
      the door of faith unto the Gentiles.<BR />
      28 And there they abode long time with the disciples.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Second Lesson<BR />
      (after Trinity 3)<BR />
      Romans 10:1-15</B><BR />
      1 Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is,
      that they might be saved.<BR />
      2 For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not
      according to knowledge.<BR />
      3 For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about
      to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves
      unto the righteousness of God.<BR />
      4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every
      one that believeth.<BR />
      5 For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law,
      That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.<BR />
      6 But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise,
      Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is,
      to bring Christ down from above:)<BR />
      7 Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up
      Christ again from the dead.)<BR />
      8 But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth,
      and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;<BR />
      9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and
      shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the
      dead, thou shalt be saved.<BR />
      10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with
      the mouth confession is made unto salvation.<BR />
      11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall
      not be ashamed.<BR />
      12 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek:
      for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.<BR />
      13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be
      saved.<BR />
      14 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?
      and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?
      and how shall they hear without a preacher?<BR />
      15 And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written,
      How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of
      peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!<BR />

      9 Who wast taken up in a whirlwind of fire, and in a chariot
      of fiery horses:<BR />
      10 Who wast ordained for reproofs in their times, to pacify the
      wrath of the Lord's judgment, before it brake forth into fury
      and to turn the heart of the father unto the son, and to restore
      the tribes of Jacob.<BR />

      5 For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized
      with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.<BR />
      6 When they therefore were come together, they asked of him,
      saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom
      to Israel?<BR />
      7 And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times
      or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.<BR />
      8 But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come
      upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem,
      and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part
      of the earth.<BR />
      9 And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he
      was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.<BR />
      10 And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went
      up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;<BR />
      11 Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up
      into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into
      heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into
      heaven.<BR />
      12 Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet,
      which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.<BR />
      13 And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room,
      where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip,
      and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus,
      and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.<BR />
      14 These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication,
      with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.<BR />
      15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples,

      18 Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity;

      his bowels gushed out.<BR />
      19 And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch
      as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that
      is to say, The field of blood.<BR />
      20 For it is written in the book of Ps, Let his habitation be
      desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishopric let

      And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From
      heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?<BR />
      26 But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold
      John as a prophet.<BR />
      27 And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he
      said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these
      things.<BR />

      1 Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the
      way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come
      to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight
      in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts.<BR />
      2 But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand
      when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like
      fullers' soap:<BR />
      3 And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he
      shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver,
      that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.<BR />
      4 Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant
      unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years.<BR />
      5 And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift
      witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and
      against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling
      in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside
      the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the LORD
      of hosts.<BR />

      1 In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness
      of Judaea,<BR />
      2 And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.<BR />
      3 For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying,
      The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way
      of the Lord, make his paths straight.<BR />
      4 And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern
      girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.<BR />
      5 Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the
      region round about Jordan,<BR />
      6 And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.<BR />
      7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to
      his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath
      warned you to flee from the wrath to come?<BR />
      8 Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:<BR />
      9 And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to
      our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones
      to raise up children unto Abraham.<BR />
      10 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore
      every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down,
      and cast into the fire.<BR />
      11 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that
      cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy
      to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:<BR />
      12 Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his
      floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn
      up the chaff with unquenchable fire.<BR />
      13 Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be
      baptized of him.<BR />
      14 But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of
      thee, and comest thou to me?<BR />
      15 And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now:
      for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he
      suffered him.<BR />
      16 And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of
      the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he
      saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon
      him:<BR />
      17 And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son,
      in whom I am well pleased.<BR />

      2 Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ,
      he sent two of his disciples,<BR />
      3 And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look
      for another?<BR />
      4 Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and show John again those

      5 The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers
      are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and
      the poor have the gospel preached to them.<BR />
      6 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.<BR />
      7 And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes
      concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see?
      A reed shaken with the wind?<BR />
      8 But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment?
      behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.<BR />

      you, and more than a prophet.<BR />
      10 For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger
      before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.<BR />
      11 Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there
      hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding
      he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.<BR />
      12 And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom
      of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.<BR />
      13 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.<BR />

      And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house

      8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye
      rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,<BR />
      9 If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent
      man, by what means he is made whole;<BR />
      10 Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel,
      that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified,
      whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand
      here before you whole.<BR />
      11 This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders,
      which is become the head of the corner.<BR />
      12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none
      other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.<BR />
      13 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived
      that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and
      they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.<BR />
      14 And beholding the man which was healed standing with them,
      they could say nothing against it.<BR />
      15 But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council,
      they conferred among themselves,<BR />
      16 Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable
      miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell
      in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.<BR />
      17 But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly
      threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.<BR />
      18 And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all
      nor teach in the name of Jesus.<BR />
      19 But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it
      be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto
      God, judge ye.<BR />
      20 For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and

      1 And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that
      the Gentiles had also received the word of God.<BR />
      2 And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of
      the circumcision contended with him,<BR />
      3 Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat
      with them.<BR />
      4 But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded
      it by order unto them, saying,<BR />
      5 I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a
      vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet,
      let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:<BR />
      6 Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered,
      and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and
      creeping things, and fowls of the air.<BR />
      7 And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and
      eat.<BR />
      8 But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath
      at any time entered into my mouth.<BR />
      9 But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath
      cleansed, that call not thou common.<BR />
      10 And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again
      into heaven.<BR />
      11 And, behold, immediately there were three men already come
      unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.<BR />
      12 And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover
      these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man's
      house:<BR />
      13 And he showed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which
      stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon,
      whose surname is Peter;<BR />
      14 Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house
      shall be saved.<BR />
      15 And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on
      us at the beginning.<BR />
      16 Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said,
      John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with
      the Holy Ghost.<BR />
      17 Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto
      us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I
      could withstand God?<BR />
      18 When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified
      God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance
      unto life.<BR />

      1 Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the
      hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.<BR />
      2 And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried,
      whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called
      Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;<BR />
      3 Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked
      an alms.<BR />
      4 And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look
      on us.<BR />
      5 And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something
      of them.<BR />
      6 Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I
      have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise
      up and walk.<BR />
      7 And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately
      his feet and ankle bones received strength.<BR />
      8 And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them
      into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.<BR />
      9 And all the people saw him walking and praising God:<BR />
      10 And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful
      gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement
      at that which had happened unto him.<BR />
      11 And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John,
      all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called
      Solomon's, greatly wondering.<BR />
      12 And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men
      of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly
      on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this
      man to walk?<BR />
      13 The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of
      our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered
      up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined
      to let him go.<BR />
      14 But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer
      to be granted unto you;<BR />
      15 And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the
      dead; whereof we are witnesses.<BR />
      16 And his name through faith in his name hath made this man
      strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him
      hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you
      all.<BR />
      17 And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it,
      as did also your rulers.<BR />
      18 But those things, which God before had shown by the mouth
      of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.<BR />
      19 Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may
      be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from
      the presence of the Lord;<BR />
      20 And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached
      unto you:<BR />
      21 Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution
      of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his
      holy prophets since the world began.<BR />
      22 For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the
      Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me;
      him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto
      you.<BR />
      23 And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not
      hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.<BR />
      24 Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow
      after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these
      days.<BR />
      25 Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which
      God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed
      shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.<BR />
      26 Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him
      to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.<BR />

      Ezekiel 34:11-16</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      11 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, will both
      search my sheep, and seek them out.<BR />
      12 As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is
      among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep,
      and will deliver them out of all places where they have been
      scattered in the cloudy and dark day.<BR />
      13 And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them
      from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and
      feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in
      all the inhabited places of the country.<BR />
      14 I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains
      of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good
      fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains
      of Israel.<BR />
      15 I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith
      the Lord GOD.<BR />
      16 I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which
      was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and
      will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat
      and the strong; I will feed them with judgment.<BR />

      John 21:15-22</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      15 So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon,
      son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him,
      Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him,
      Feed my lambs.<BR />
      16 He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas,
      lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that
      I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.<BR />
      17 He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest
      thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third
      time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest
      all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him,
      Feed my sheep.<BR />
      18 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou
      girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when
      thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another
      shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.<BR />
      19 This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify
      God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.<BR />
      20 Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved
      following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said,
      Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?<BR />
      21 Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this
      man do?<BR />
      22 Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come,
      what is that to thee? follow thou me.<BR />
