      1 Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.<BR />
      2 Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her
      warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she
      hath received of the LORD's hand double for all her sins.<BR />
      3 The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye
      the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for
      our God.<BR />
      4 Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill
      shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and
      the rough places plain:<BR />
      5 And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh
      shall see it together: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken
      it.<BR />
      6 The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh
      is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of
      the field:<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor225778"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">7 The
      grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the
      LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people is grass.<BR />
      8 The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our
      God shall stand for ever.<BR />
      9 O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high
      mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy
      voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the
      cities of Judah, Behold your God!<BR />
      10 Behold, the Lord GOD will come with strong hand, and his arm
      shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his work
      before him.<BR />
      11 He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the
      lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently
      lead those that are with young.<BR />

      1 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar,
      Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch
      of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of
      the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,<BR />
      2 Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God
      came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.<BR />
      3 And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the
      baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;<BR />
      4 As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet,
      saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye
      the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.<BR />
      5 Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall
      be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the
      rough ways shall be made smooth;<BR />
      6 And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.<BR />
      7 Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized
      of him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from
      the wrath to come?<BR />
      8 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin
      not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father:
      for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise
      up children unto Abraham.<BR />
      9 And now also the ax is laid unto the root of the trees: every
      tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down,
      and cast into the fire.<BR />
      10 And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?<BR />
      11 He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats,
      let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat,
      let him do likewise.<BR />
      12 Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him,
      Master, what shall we do?<BR />
      13 And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed
      you.<BR />
      14 And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what
      shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither
      accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages.<BR />
      15 And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in
      their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not;<BR />
      16 John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you
      with water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose
      shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the
      Holy Ghost and with fire:<BR />
      17 Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his
      floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff
      he will burn with fire unquenchable.<BR />

      12 Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and

      and the hills in a balance?<BR />

      to him the way of understanding?<BR />
      15 Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted
      as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles
      as a very little thing.<BR />
      16 And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof
      sufficient for a burnt offering.<BR />
      17 All nations before him are as nothing; and they are counted

      22 It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the
      inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out
      the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to
      dwell in:<BR />

      24 Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown:
      yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall

      26 Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these
      things, that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them
      all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong
      in power; not one faileth.<BR />

      hid from the LORD, and my judgment is passed over from my God?<BR />
      28 Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting
      God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth
      not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding.<BR />
      29 He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might

      Luke 1:5-25</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      5 There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain
      priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was
      of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.<BR />
      6 And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the
      commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.<BR />
      7 And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and
      they both were now well stricken in years.<BR />
      8 And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office
      before God in the order of his course,<BR />
      9 According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was
      to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.<BR />
      10 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without
      at the time of incense.<BR />
      11 And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing
      on the right side of the altar of incense.<BR />
      12 And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell
      upon him.<BR />
      13 But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy
      prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son,
      and thou shalt call his name John.<BR />
      14 And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice
      at his birth.<BR />
      15 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall
      drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with
      the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.<BR />
      16 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord
      their God.<BR />
      17 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias,
      to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient
      to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for
      the Lord.<BR />
      18 And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this?
      for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.<BR />
      19 And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that
      stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee,
      and to show thee these glad tidings.<BR />

      behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the
      day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest
      not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.<BR />
      21 And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he
      tarried so long in the temple.<BR />
      22 And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they
      perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned
      unto them, and remained speechless.<BR />
      23 And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration
      were accomplished, he departed to his own house.<BR />

      3 Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of

      26 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God

      cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.<BR />
      30 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast
      found favour with God.<BR />
      31 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth
      a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.<BR />

      David:<BR />

      his kingdom there shall be no end.<BR />
      34 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I
      know not a man?<BR />

      come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow
      thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee
      shall be called the Son of God.<BR />

      11 Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone
      most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;<BR />
      12 And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at
      the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are
      the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:<BR />
      13 On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the

      thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height
      of it are equal.<BR />
      17 And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and
      four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the

      the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus;
      the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.<BR />
      21 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: every several gate
      was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as
      it were transparent glass.<BR />
      22 And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and
      the Lamb are the temple of it.<BR />
      23 And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon,
      to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the

      David be established before thee.<BR />

      thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath
      thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.<BR />
      28 And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true,
      and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:<BR />

      the tree were for the healing of the nations.<BR />
