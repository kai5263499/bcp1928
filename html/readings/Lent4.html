      4 Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from
      heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain
      rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk
      in my law, or no.<BR />
      5 And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall
      prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much
      as they gather daily.<BR />
      6 And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At
      even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from
      the land of Egypt:<BR />
      7 And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD;
      for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what
      are we, that ye murmur against us?<BR />
      8 And Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you
      in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the
      full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur
      against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against
      us, but against the LORD.<BR />
      9 And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of
      the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath
      heard your murmurings.<BR />
      10 And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation
      of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness,
      and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.<BR />
      11 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor725313"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">12 I
      have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto
      them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning
      ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the
      LORD your God.<BR />
      13 And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and
      covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about
      the host.<BR />
      14 And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face
      of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as
      the hoar frost on the ground.<BR />
      15 And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another,
      It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto
      them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.<BR />

      Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which
      endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give
      unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.<BR />
      28 Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work
      the works of God?<BR />
      29 Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God,
      that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.<BR />
      30 They said therefore unto him, What sign showest thou then,
      that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?<BR />
      31 Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written,
      He gave them bread from heaven to eat.<BR />
      32 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
      Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth
      you the true bread from heaven.<BR />
      33 For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven,
      and giveth life unto the world.<BR />
      34 Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor737523"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">35 And
      Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh
      to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never
      thirst.<BR />
      36 But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe
      not.<BR />
      37 All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that
      cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.<BR />
      38 For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but
      the will of him that sent me.<BR />
      39 And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of
      all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should
      raise it up again at the last day.<BR />
      40 And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which
      seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life:
      and I will raise him up at the last day.<BR />

      The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread
      which came down from heaven.<BR />
      42 And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose
      father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came

      Genesis 44</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the
      men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every
      man's money in his sack's mouth.<BR />
      2 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the
      youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word
      that Joseph had spoken.<BR />
      3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they
      and their asses.<BR />
      4 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off,
      Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when
      thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded
      evil for good?<BR />
      5 Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed
      he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.<BR />
      6 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.<BR />
      7 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words?
      God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:<BR />
      8 Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we
      brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should
      we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?<BR />
      9 With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die,
      and we also will be my lord's bondmen.<BR />
      10 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words:
      he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be
      blameless.<BR />
      11 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground,
      and opened every man his sack.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor1006606"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">12 And
      he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest:
      and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.<BR />
      13 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass,
      and returned to the city.<BR />
      14 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he
      was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.<BR />
      15 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have
      done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?<BR />
      16 And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall
      we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out
      the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants,
      both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.<BR />
      17 And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in
      whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for
      you, get you up in peace unto your father.<BR />
      18 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy
      servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let
      not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as
      Pharaoh.<BR />
      19 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a
      brother?<BR />
      20 And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and
      a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead,
      and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.<BR />
      21 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me,
      that I may set mine eyes upon him.<BR />
      22 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father:
      for if he should leave his father, his father would die.<BR />
      23 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother
      come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.<BR />
      24 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father,
      we told him the words of my lord.<BR />
      25 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.<BR />
      26 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be
      with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face,
      except our youngest brother be with us.<BR />
      27 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife
      bare me two sons:<BR />
      28 And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn
      in pieces; and I saw him not since:<BR />
      29 And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him,
      ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.<BR />
      30 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the
      lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's
      life;<BR />
      31 It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with
      us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray
      hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.<BR />
      32 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father,
      saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame
      to my father for ever.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor1008601"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">33 Now
      therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the
      lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.<BR />
      34 For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with
      me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.<BR />

      12 For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the
      members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is
      Christ.<BR />
      13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether
      we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have
      been all made to drink into one Spirit.<BR />
      14 For the body is not one member, but many.<BR />
      15 If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not
      of the body; is it therefore not of the body?<BR />
      16 And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not
      of the body; is it therefore not of the body?<BR />
      17 If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If
      the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?<BR />
      18 But now hath God set the members every one of them in the
      body, as it hath pleased him.<BR />
      19 And if they were all one member, where were the body?<BR />

      now are they many members, yet but one body.<BR />
      21 And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee:
      nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.<BR />
      22 Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be
      more feeble, are necessary:<BR />
      23 And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable,
      upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts
      have more abundant comeliness.<BR />
      24 For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the
      body together, having given more abundant honour to that part
      which lacked:<BR />
      25 That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members
      should have the same care one for another.<BR />
      26 And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with
      it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.<BR />
      27 Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.<BR />
      28 And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily
      prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of
      healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.<BR />
      29 Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are

      his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother
      should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.<BR />
      20 Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife,

      1 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that
      stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me.
      And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known
      unto his brethren.<BR />
      2 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh
      heard.<BR />
      3 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father
      yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were
      troubled at his presence.<BR />
      4 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray
      you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother,
      whom ye sold into Egypt.<BR />
      5 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that
      ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve
      life.<BR />
      6 For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet
      there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing
      nor harvest.<BR />
      7 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the
      earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.<BR />
      8 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he
      hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house,
      and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.<BR />
      9 Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith
      thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down
      unto me, tarry not:<BR />
      10 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt
      be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children,
      and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:<BR />
      11 And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years
      of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast,
      come to poverty.<BR />
      12 And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin,
      that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.<BR />
      13 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and
      of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my
      father hither.<BR />
      14 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and
      Benjamin wept upon his neck.<BR />
      15 Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and
      after that his brethren talked with him.<BR />
      16 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying,
      Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and
      his servants.<BR />
      17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This
      do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;<BR />
      18 And take your father and your households, and come unto me:
      and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall
      eat the fat of the land.<BR />
      19 Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of
      the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and
      bring your father, and come.<BR />
      20 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of
      Egypt is yours.<BR />
      21 And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons,
      according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision
      for the way.<BR />
      22 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to
      Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes
      of raiment.<BR />
      23 And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden
      with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn
      and bread and meat for his father by the way.<BR />
      24 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said
      unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.<BR />
      25 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan
      unto Jacob their father,<BR />
      26 And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor
      over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he
      believed them not.<BR />
      27 And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said
      unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to
      carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:<BR />
      28 And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive:
      I will go and see him before I die.<BR />

      31 And yet show I unto you a more excellent way.<BR />
      1 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have
      not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.<BR />
      2 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all
      mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so
      that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.<BR />
      3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though
      I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth
      me nothing.<BR />
      4 Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity
      vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,<BR />
      5 Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not
      easily provoked, thinketh no evil;<BR />
      6 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;<BR />
      7 Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things,
      endureth all things.<BR />
      8 Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they
      shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether
      there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.<BR />
      9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.<BR />
      10 But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is
      in part shall be done away.<BR />
      11 When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a
      child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away
      childish things.<BR />
      12 For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face:
      now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.<BR />
      13 And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the
      greatest of these is charity.<BR />

      28 And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning
      together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked
      him, Which is the first commandment of all?<BR />
      29 And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments
      is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:<BR />
      30 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
      with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength:
      this is the first commandment.<BR />
      31 And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour
      as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.<BR />
      32 And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said
      the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but
      he:<BR />
      33 And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding,
      and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love
      his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings
      and sacrifices.<BR />
      34 And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto
      him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after
      that durst ask him any question.<BR />

      How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?<BR />

      my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies

      29 And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called
      his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace
      in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and
      deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:<BR />
      30 But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out
      of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will

      31 And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel
      bowed himself upon the bed's head.<BR />
      8 And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?<BR />
      9 And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God
      hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray
      thee, unto me, and I will bless them.<BR />
      10 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could
      not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them,
      and embraced them.<BR />

      face: and, lo, God hath shown me also thy seed.<BR />
      12 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he
      bowed himself with his face to the earth.<BR />
      13 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward
      Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's
      right hand, and brought them near unto him.<BR />
      14 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon
      Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's
      head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.<BR />
      15 And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers
      Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life
      long unto this day,<BR />
      16 The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads;
      and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers
      Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the
      midst of the earth.<BR />
      17 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon
      the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's
      hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.<BR />
      18 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this
      is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.<BR />
      19 And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know
      it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great:
      but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his
      seed shall become a multitude of nations.<BR />
      20 And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel
      bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and
      he set Ephraim before Manasseh.<BR />

      1 Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather

      2 For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto
      men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the
      spirit he speaketh mysteries.<BR />
      3 But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and
      exhortation, and comfort.<BR />
      4 He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but
      he that prophesieth edifieth the church.<BR />
      5 I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye
      prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh
      with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive
      edifying.<BR />
      6 Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what
      shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation,
      or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?<BR />
      7 And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or
      harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall
      it be known what is piped or harped?<BR />
      8 For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare
      himself to the battle?<BR />
      9 So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to
      be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall
      speak into the air.<BR />
      10 There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world,
      and none of them is without signification.<BR />
      11 Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall

      a spoiler at noonday: I have caused him to fall upon it suddenly,
      and terrors upon the city.<BR />
      9 She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up the

      ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver
      to the sword before their enemies, saith the LORD.<BR />

      33 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he
      gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost,
      and was gathered unto his people.<BR />
      1 And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him,
      and kissed him.<BR />
      2 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm
      his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.<BR />
      3 And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled
      the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned
      for him threescore and ten days.<BR />
      4 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto
      the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your
      eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,<BR />
      5 My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which
      I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou
      bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my
      father, and I will come again.<BR />
      6 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as
      he made thee swear.<BR />
      7 And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up
      all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all
      the elders of the land of Egypt,<BR />
      8 And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's
      house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds,
      they left in the land of Goshen.<BR />
      9 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and
      it was a very great company.<BR />
      10 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond
      Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation:
      and he made a mourning for his father seven days.<BR />
      11 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw
      the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous
      mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called
      Abel-mizraim, which is beyond Jordan.<BR />
      12 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:<BR />
      13 For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried
      him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought
      with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the
      Hittite, before Mamre.<BR />
      14 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and
      all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried
      his father.<BR />
      15 And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead,
      they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly
      requite us all the evil which we did unto him.<BR />
      16 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father
      did command before he died, saying,<BR />
      17 So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the
      trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee
      evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants
      of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto
      him.<BR />
      18 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face;
      and they said, Behold, we be thy servants.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor1020776"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">19 And
      Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?<BR />

      as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto

      alive.<BR />
      21 Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little
      ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.<BR />
      22 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and
      Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.<BR />
      23 And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation:
      the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought
      up upon Joseph's knees.<BR />
      24 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely
      visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which
      he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.<BR />
      25 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying,
      God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from
      hence.<BR />
      26 So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they
      embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.<BR />

      13 Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray

      18 I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:<BR />

      22 Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe,

      them that believe not, but for them which believe.<BR />
      23 If therefore the whole church be come together into one place,
      and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are

      25 And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so

      God is in you of a truth.<BR />

      27 If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or

      18 And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.<BR />
      19 For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from
      the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time,
      neither shall be.<BR />
      20 And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh
      should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen,
      he hath shortened the days.<BR />
      21 And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ;
      or, lo, he is there; believe him not:<BR />
      22 For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall
      show signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even
      the elect.<BR />
      23 But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.<BR />

      Exodus 2:1-22</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife
      a daughter of Levi.<BR />
      2 And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him
      that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.<BR />
      3 And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an
      ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and
      put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's
      brink.<BR />
      4 And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to
      him.<BR />
      5 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the
      river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and
      when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch
      it.<BR />
      6 And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold,
      the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This
      is one of the Hebrews' children.<BR />
      7 Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and
      call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse
      the child for thee?<BR />
      8 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and
      called the child's mother.<BR />
      9 And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away,
      and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the
      woman took the child, and nursed it.<BR />
      10 And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter,
      and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she
      said, Because I drew him out of the water.<BR />
      11 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that
      he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and
      he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.<BR />
      12 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that
      there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.<BR />
      13 And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the
      Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong,
      Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?<BR />
      14 And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest
      thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared,
      and said, Surely this thing is known.<BR />
      15 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses.
      But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land
      of Midian: and he sat down by a well.<BR />
      16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came
      and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's
      flock.<BR />
      17 And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood
      up and helped them, and watered their flock.<BR />
      18 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is
      it that ye are come so soon today?<BR />
      19 And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of
      the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered
      the flock.<BR />
      20 And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it
      that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.<BR />
      21 And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses
      Zipporah his daughter.<BR />
      22 And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for
      he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.<BR />

      1 Corinthians 15:1-11</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached
      unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;<BR />
      2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached
      unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.<BR />
      3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received,
      how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;<BR />
      4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day
      according to the scriptures:<BR />
      5 And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:<BR />
      6 After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once;
      of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are
      fallen asleep.<BR />
      7 After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.<BR />
      8 And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out
      of due time.<BR />
      9 For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be
      called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.<BR />
      10 But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which
      was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly
      than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with
      me.<BR />
      11 Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so
      ye believed.<BR />

      Thus saith the LORD; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man,
      and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the
      LORD.<BR />
      6 For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not
      see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in
      the wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited.<BR />
      7 Blessed is the man that trusteth in the LORD, and whose hope
      the LORD is.<BR />
      8 For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth
      out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh,
      but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the
      year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.<BR />

      heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked:
      who can know it?<BR />
      10 I the LORD search the heart, I try the reins, even to give
      every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of
      his doings.<BR />
      11 As the partridge sitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not; so
      he that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them in
      the midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool.<BR />
      12 A glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of
      our sanctuary.<BR />
      13 O LORD, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be

      Mark 13:24-37</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      24 But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be
      darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,<BR />
      25 And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are
      in heaven shall be shaken.<BR />
      26 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds
      with great power and glory.<BR />
      27 And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together
      his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the
      earth to the uttermost part of heaven.<BR />
      28 Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet
      tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:<BR />
      29 So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come
      to pass, know that it is nigh, even at the doors.<BR />
      30 Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass,
      till all these things be done.<BR />
      31 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass
      away.<BR />
      32 But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the
      angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.<BR />
      33 Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time
      is.<BR />
      34 For the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left
      his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man
      his work, and commanded the porter to watch.<BR />
      35 Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the
      house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing,
      or in the morning:<BR />
      36 Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.<BR />
      37 And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.<BR />
