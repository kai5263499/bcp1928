      1 Let us now praise famous men, and our fathers that begat us.<BR />
      2 The Lord hath wrought great glory by them through his great
      power from the beginning.<BR />
      3 Such as did bear rule in their kingdoms, men renowned for their
      power, giving counsel by their understanding, and declaring prophecies:<BR />
      4 Leaders of the people by their counsels, and by their knowledge
      of learning meet for the people, wise and eloquent in their instructions:<BR />
      5 Such as found out musical tunes, and recited verses in writing:<BR />
      6 Rich men furnished with ability, living peaceably in their
      habitations;<BR />
      7 All these were honoured in their generations, and were the
      glory of their times.<BR />
      8 There be of them, that have left a name behind them, that their
      praises might be reported.<BR />
      9 And some there be, which have no memorial; who are perished,
      as though they had never been; and are become as though they
      had never been born, and their children after them.<BR />
      10 But these were merciful men, whose righteousness hath not
      been forgotten.<BR />
      11 With their seed shall continually remain a good inheritance,
      and their children are within the covenant.<BR />
      12 Their seed standeth fast, and their children for their sakes.<BR />
      13 Their seed shall remain for ever, and their glory shall not
      be blotted out.<BR />
      14 Their bodies are buried in peace; but their name liveth for
      evermore.<BR />
      15 The people will tell of their wisdom, and the congregation
      will show forth their praise.<BR />

      Hebrews 11:32-12:2</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      32 And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell
      of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David
      also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:<BR />
      33 Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness,
      obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,<BR />
      34 Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword,
      out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned
      to flight the armies of the aliens.<BR />
      35 Women received their dead raised to life again: and others
      were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain
      a better resurrection:<BR />
      36 And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea,
      moreover of bonds and imprisonment:<BR />
      37 They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were
      slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins;
      being destitute, afflicted, tormented;<BR />
      38 (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts,
      and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.<BR />
      39 And these all, having obtained a good report through faith,
      received not the promise:<BR />
      40 God having provided some better thing for us, that they without
      us should not be made perfect.<BR />
      1 Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great
      a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the
      sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience
      the race that is set before us,<BR />
      2 Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who
      for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising
      the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of
      God.<BR />

      The souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and there
      shall no torment touch them.<BR />
      2 In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die: and their departure
      is taken for misery,<BR />

      in peace.<BR />
      4 For though they be punished in the sight of men, yet is their
      hope full of immortality.<BR />
      5 And having been a little chastised, they shall be greatly rewarded:
      for God proved them, and found them worthy for himself.<BR />
      6 As gold in the furnace hath he tried them, and received them
      as a burnt offering.<BR />
      7 And in the time of their visitation they shall shine, and run
      to and fro like sparks among the stubble.<BR />
      8 They shall judge the nations, and have dominion over the people,

      1 And after these things I heard a great voice of much people
      in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour,
      and power, unto the Lord our God:<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor559153"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">2 For
      true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged the
      great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication,
      and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.<BR />
      3 And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever
      and ever.<BR />
      4 And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down
      and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.<BR />
      5 And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God,
      all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.<BR />
      6 And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and
      as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings,
      saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.<BR />
      7 Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the
      marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself
      ready.<BR />
      8 And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen,
      clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.<BR />
      9 And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called
      unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These
      are the true sayings of God.<BR />
      10 And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me,
      See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren
      that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony
      of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.<BR />
      11 And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he
      that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness
      he doth judge and make war.<BR />
      12 His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many
      crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.<BR />
      13 And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his
      name is called The Word of God.<BR />
      14 And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white
      horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.<BR />
      15 And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he
      should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of
      iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath
      of Almighty God.<BR />
      16 And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written,
      KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.<BR />

      1 THEN shall the righteous man stand in great boldness before
      the face of such as have afflicted him, and made no account of

      2 When they see it, they shall be troubled with terrible fear,

      say within themselves, This was he, whom we had sometimes in

      5 How is he numbered among the children of God, and his lot is

      1 And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven

      2 And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from
      God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.<BR />
      3 And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the
      tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and
      they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them,

      22 And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and

      23 And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon,
      to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the
      Lamb is the light thereof.<BR />
      24 And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the

      proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.<BR />
      2 In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the
      river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of
      fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of
      the tree were for the healing of the nations.<BR />
      3 And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and

      1 Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far;
      The LORD hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my
      mother hath he made mention of my name.<BR />
      2 And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow
      of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in

      3 And said unto me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I
      will be glorified.<BR />
      4 Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength
      for nought, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the LORD,
      and my work with my God.<BR />
      5 And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb to be
      his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not
      gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and
      my God shall be my strength.<BR />
      6 And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my
      servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved
      of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles,
      that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.<BR />

      1 Corinthians 4:1-16</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ,
      and stewards of the mysteries of God.<BR />
      2 Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.<BR />
      3 But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged
      of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.<BR />
      4 For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified:
      but he that judgeth me is the Lord.<BR />
      5 Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come,
      who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and
      will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall
      every man have praise of God.<BR />
      6 And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred
      to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn
      in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no
      one of you be puffed up for one against another.<BR />
      7 For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou
      that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why
      dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?<BR />
      8 Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings
      without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might
      reign with you.<BR />
      9 For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as
      it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto
      the world, and to angels, and to men.<BR />
      10 We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ;
      we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are
      despised.<BR />
      11 Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and
      are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;<BR />
      12 And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we
      bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:<BR />
      13 Being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the
      world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day.<BR />
      14 I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons
      I warn you.<BR />
      15 For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet
      have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten
      you through the gospel.<BR />

      38 Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto
      them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say,
      being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?<BR />
      39 He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where
      he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth
      hour.<BR />
      40 One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was
      Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.<BR />
      41 He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him,
      We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.<BR />
      42 And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he
      said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas,
      which is by interpretation, A stone.<BR />

      20 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; It shall yet come to pass, that

      of hosts: I will go also.<BR />
      22 Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the
      LORD of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the LORD.<BR />
      23 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; In those days it shall come
      to pass, that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of
      the nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is
      a Jew, saying, We will go with you: for we have heard that God
      is with you.<BR />

      John 11:20-36</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      20 Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went
      and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor1476170"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">21 Then
      said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother
      had not died.<BR />
      22 But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God,
      God will give it thee.<BR />
      23 Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.<BR />
      24 Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in
      the resurrection at the last day.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor1482718"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">25 Jesus
      said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth
      in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:<BR />
      26 And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.
      Believest thou this?<BR />
      27 She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the
      Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.<BR />
      28 And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary
      her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth
      for thee.<BR />
      29 As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto
      him.<BR />
      30 Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that
      place where Martha met him.<BR />
      31 The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted
      her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out,
      followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.<BR />
      32 Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she
      fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been
      here, my brother had not died.<BR />
      33 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping
      which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,<BR />
      34 And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord,
      come and see.<BR />
      35 Jesus wept.<BR />
      36 Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!<BR />
