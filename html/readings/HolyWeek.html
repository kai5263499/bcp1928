      Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem:
      behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation;
      lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an
      ass.<BR />
      10 And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse
      from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall
      speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion shall be from
      sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth.<BR />
      11 As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent
      forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water.<BR />
      12 Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even today
      do I declare that I will render double unto thee.<BR />

      1 And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany,
      at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,<BR />
      2 And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against
      you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt
      tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him.<BR />
      3 And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the
      Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither.<BR />
      4 And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door
      without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.<BR />
      5 And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do
      ye, loosing the colt?<BR />
      6 And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they
      let them go.<BR />
      7 And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments
      on him; and he sat upon him.<BR />
      8 And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down
      branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way.<BR />
      9 And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying,
      Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord:<BR />

      11 And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and
      when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide
      was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.<BR />

      The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they
      have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom is in them?<BR />
      10 Therefore will I give their wives unto others, and their fields
      to them that shall inherit them: for every one from the least
      even unto the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet
      even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.<BR />
      11 For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people
      slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.<BR />
      12 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay,
      they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore
      shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation
      they shall be cast down, saith the LORD.<BR />
      13 I will surely consume them, saith the LORD: there shall be
      no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf
      shall fade; and the things that I have given them shall pass
      away from them.<BR />
      14 Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter
      into the defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the
      LORD our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of gall
      to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD.<BR />

      looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of health,
      and behold trouble!<BR />
      18 When I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart is faint
      in me.<BR />
      19 Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because
      of them that dwell in a far country: Is not the LORD in Zion?
      is not her king in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with
      their graven images, and with strange vanities?<BR />
      20 The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.<BR />
      21 For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am
      black; astonishment hath taken hold on me.<BR />
      22 Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? why
      then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?<BR />
      1 Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears,
      that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter
      of my people!<BR />

      For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel:
      not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be
      made of none effect.<BR />
      18 For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness;
      but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.<BR />
      19 For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,
      and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.<BR />
      20 Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer
      of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?<BR />
      21 For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew
      not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save
      them that believe.<BR />
      22 For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:<BR />
      23 But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock,
      and unto the Greeks foolishness;<BR />
      24 But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ
      the power of God, and the wisdom of God.<BR />
      25 Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the
      weakness of God is stronger than men.<BR />
      26 For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise
      men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:<BR />
      27 But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound
      the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to
      confound the things which are mighty;<BR />
      28 And base things of the world, and things which are despised,
      hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought
      things that are:<BR />
      29 That no flesh should glory in his presence.<BR />
      30 But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto
      us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:<BR />

      Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also

      2 In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so,
      I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.<BR />
      3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again,
      and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be

      4 And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.<BR />
      5 Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest;
      and how can we know the way?<BR />
      6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life:
      no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.<BR />
      7 If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and
      from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.<BR />
      8 Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth

      9 Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and
      yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath
      seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Show us the Father?<BR />
      10 Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father
      in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself:

      12 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the
      works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these
      shall he do; because I go unto my Father.<BR />

      7 Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her
      miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of
      old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none
      did help her: the adversaries saw her, and did mock at her sabbaths.<BR />
      8 Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed:
      all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her
      nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.<BR />
      9 Her filthiness is in her skirts; she remembereth not her last
      end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter.
      O LORD, behold my affliction: for the enemy hath magnified himself.<BR />
      10 The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant
      things: for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary,
      whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy congregation.<BR />
      11 All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their
      pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O LORD, and
      consider; for I am become vile.<BR />
      12 Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see
      if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto
      me, wherewith the LORD hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce

      15 If ye love me, keep my commandments.<BR />
      16 And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another
      Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;<BR />
      17 Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because
      it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he
      dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.<BR />
      18 I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.<BR />
      19 Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye
      see me: because I live, ye shall live also.<BR />
      20 At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in
      me, and I in you.<BR />
      21 He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that
      loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father,
      and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.<BR />
      22 Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou
      wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?<BR />
      23 Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will
      keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come
      unto him, and make our abode with him.<BR />
      24 He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word
      which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.<BR />
      25 These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with
      you.<BR />
      26 But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father
      will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring
      all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.<BR />
      27 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the
      world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled,
      neither let it be afraid.<BR />
      28 Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again
      unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I
      go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.<BR />
      29 And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when
      it is come to pass, ye might believe.<BR />
      30 Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of
      this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.<BR />
      31 But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as
      the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go
      hence.<BR />

      1 I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.<BR />
      2 Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and
      every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring
      forth more fruit.<BR />
      3 Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto
      you.<BR />
      4 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit
      of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except
      ye abide in me.<BR />
      5 I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me,
      and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without
      me ye can do nothing.<BR />
      6 If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and
      is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire,
      and they are burned.<BR />
      7 If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask
      what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.<BR />
      8 Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so
      shall ye be my disciples.<BR />
      9 As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue
      ye in my love.<BR />
      10 If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even
      as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.<BR />
      11 These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain
      in you, and that your joy might be full.<BR />
      12 This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have
      loved you.<BR />
      13 Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his
      life for his friends.<BR />
      14 Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.<BR />
      15 Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth
      not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all
      things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto
      you.<BR />

      my name, he may give it you.<BR />

      10 The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, and
      keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have
      girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang
      down their heads to the ground.<BR />
      13 What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall
      I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal
      to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion?
      for thy breach is great like the sea: who can heal thee?<BR />
      14 Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and
      they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity;
      but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor1348337"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">15 All
      that pass by clap their hands at thee; they hiss and wag their
      head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the city that
      men call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?<BR />
      16 All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they
      hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed her up:
      certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found,
      we have seen it.<BR />
      17 The LORD hath done that which he had devised; he hath fulfilled
      his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he hath thrown
      down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused thine enemy to
      rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries.<BR />
      18 Their heart cried unto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of
      Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself
      no rest: let not the apple of thine eye cease.<BR />
      19 Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches
      pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord:
      lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children,
      that faint for hunger in the top of every street.<BR />

      20 Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not
      greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will
      also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep

      did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated
      both me and my Father.<BR />
      25 But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled
      that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.<BR />

      I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the

      19 Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass,

      22 Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom

      23 Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples,
      whom Jesus loved.<BR />
      24 Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask
      who it should be of whom he spake.<BR />

      answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped

      the son of Simon.<BR />
      27 And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus
      unto him, That thou doest, do quickly.<BR />
      28 Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this

      29 For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that
      Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of
      against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.<BR />
      30 He then having received the sop went immediately out: and
      it was night.<BR />
      31 Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son

      32 If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in
      himself, and shall straightway glorify him.<BR />

      34 A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another;
      as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.<BR />
      35 By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye
      have love one to another.<BR />
      36 Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus
      answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but
      thou shalt follow me afterwards.<BR />
      37 Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I
      will lay down my life for thy sake.<BR />
      38 Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake?
      Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till
      thou hast denied me thrice.<BR />

      40 Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD.<BR />
      41 Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.<BR />
      42 We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.<BR />
      43 Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast
      slain, thou hast not pitied.<BR />
      44 Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should
      not pass through.<BR />
      45 Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst

      46 All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.<BR />
      47 Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.<BR />

      1 These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven,
      and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy
      Son also may glorify thee:<BR />
      2 As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should
      give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.<BR />
      3 And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only
      true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.<BR />
      4 I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work
      which thou gavest me to do.<BR />
      5 And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with
      the glory which I had with thee before the world was.<BR />
      6 I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me
      out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and
      they have kept thy word.<BR />
      7 Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given
      me are of thee.<BR />
      8 For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me;
      and they have received them, and have known surely that I came
      out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.<BR />
      9 I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which
      thou hast given me; for they are thine.<BR />
      10 And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified
      in them.<BR />
      11 And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world,
      and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name
      those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.<BR />
      12 While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name:
      those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost,
      but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.<BR />
      13 And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world,
      that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.<BR />
      14 I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them,
      because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.<BR />
      15 I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world,
      but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.<BR />
      16 They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.<BR />
      17 Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.<BR />
      18 As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent
      them into the world.<BR />
      19 And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might
      be sanctified through the truth.<BR />
      20 Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall
      believe on me through their word;<BR />
      21 That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and
      I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may
      believe that thou hast sent me.<BR />

      the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may

      one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and
      hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.<BR />
      24 Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be
      with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou
      hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the
      world.<BR />
      25 O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have
      known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.<BR />
      26 And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it:
      that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and
      I in them.<BR />

      1 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt
      Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here
      I am.<BR />
      2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou
      lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there
      for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell
      thee of.<BR />
      3 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass,
      and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and
      clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went
      unto the place of which God had told him.<BR />
      4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the
      place afar off.<BR />
      5 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the
      ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again
      to you.<BR />
      6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it
      upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife;
      and they went both of them together.<BR />
      7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father:
      and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire
      and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?<BR />
      8 And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for
      a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.<BR />
      9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham
      built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac
      his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.<BR />
      10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to
      slay his son.<BR />
      11 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and
      said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.<BR />
      12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou
      any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing
      thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.<BR />
      13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind
      him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went
      and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in
      the stead of his son.<BR />
      14 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as
      it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be
      seen.<BR />
      15 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven
      the second time,<BR />
      16 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because
      thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine
      only son:<BR />
      17 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will
      multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand
      which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate
      of his enemies;<BR />
      18 And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;
      because thou hast obeyed my voice.<BR />

      John 18 </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples
      over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he
      entered, and his disciples.<BR />
      2 And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus
      ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.<BR />
      3 Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from
      the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns
      and torches and weapons.<BR />
      4 Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him,
      went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?<BR />
      5 They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them,
      I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.<BR />
      6 As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward,
      and fell to the ground.<BR />
      7 Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus
      of Nazareth.<BR />
      8 Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore
      ye seek me, let these go their way:<BR />
      9 That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them
      which thou gavest me have I lost none.<BR />
      10 Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high
      priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name
      was Malchus.<BR />
      11 Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath:
      the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?<BR />
      12 Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took
      Jesus, and bound him,<BR />
      13 And led him away to Annas first; for he was father-in-law
      to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.<BR />
      14 Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that
      it was expedient that one man should die for the people.<BR />
      15 And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple:
      that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with
      Jesus into the palace of the high priest.<BR />
      16 But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other
      disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto
      her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.<BR />
      17 Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not
      thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.<BR />
      18 And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a
      fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and
      Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.<BR />
      19 The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of
      his doctrine.<BR />
      20 Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught
      in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always
      resort; and in secret have I said nothing.<BR />
      21 Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said
      unto them: behold, they know what I said.<BR />
      22 And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood
      by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest
      thou the high priest so?<BR />
      23 Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of
      the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?<BR />
      24 Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.<BR />
      25 And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore
      unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it,
      and said, I am not.<BR />
      26 One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman
      whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden
      with him?<BR />
      27 Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.<BR />
      28 Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment:
      and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment
      hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the
      passover.<BR />
      29 Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation
      bring ye against this man?<BR />
      30 They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor,
      we would not have delivered him up unto thee.<BR />
      31 Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according
      to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful
      for us to put any man to death:<BR />
      32 That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake,
      signifying what death he should die.<BR />
      33 Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called
      Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?<BR />
      34 Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or
      did others tell it thee of me?<BR />
      35 Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief
      priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?<BR />
      36 Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom
      were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should
      not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from
      hence.<BR />
      37 Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus
      answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born,
      and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear
      witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth
      my voice.<BR />
      38 Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said
      this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I
      find in him no fault at all.<BR />
      39 But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at
      the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King
      of the Jews?<BR />
      40 Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas.
      Now Barabbas was a robber.<BR />

      13 Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted
      and extolled, and be very high.<BR />
      14 As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more
      than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:<BR />
      15 So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their
      mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they
      see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider.<BR />
      1 Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the
      LORD revealed?<BR />
      2 For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a
      root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and
      when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire
      him.<BR />
      3 He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted
      with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was
      despised, and we esteemed him not.<BR />
      4 Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet
      we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.<BR />
      5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for
      our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and
      with his stripes we are healed.<BR />
      6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one
      to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of
      us all.<BR />
      7 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his
      mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep
      before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.<BR />
      8 He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare
      his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living:
      for the transgression of my people was he stricken.<BR />
      9 And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in
      his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit
      in his mouth.<BR />
      10 Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to
      grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he
      shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure
      of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.<BR />
      11 He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied:
      by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for
      he shall bear their iniquities.<BR />
      12 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and
      he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured
      out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors;
      and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.<BR />

      but as the servants of God.<BR />
      17 Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the
      king.<BR />
      18 Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only
      to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.<BR />
      19 For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God
      endure grief, suffering wrongfully.<BR />
      20 For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults,
      ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer
      for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.<BR />
      21 For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered
      for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:<BR />
      22 Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:<BR />
      23 Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered,
      he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth
      righteously:<BR />
      24 Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree,
      that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness:
      by whose stripes ye were healed.<BR />
      25 For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto
      the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.<BR />

      1 Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble.<BR />
      2 He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also
      as a shadow, and continueth not.<BR />
      3 And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest
      me into judgment with thee?<BR />

      can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.<BR />

      with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;<BR />
      6 Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish,
      as an hireling, his day.<BR />
      7 For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will
      sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.<BR />
      8 Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock
      thereof die in the ground;<BR />
      9 Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth
      boughs like a plant.<BR />
      10 But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost,
      and where is he?<BR />
      11 As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and
      drieth up:<BR />
      12 So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no
      more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.<BR />
      13 O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest
      keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint
      me a set time, and remember me!<BR />
      14 If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed
      time will I wait, till my change come.<BR />

      38 And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus,
      but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might
      take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came
      therefore, and took the body of Jesus.<BR />
      39 And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to
      Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about
      an hundred pound weight.<BR />
      40 Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes
      with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.<BR />
      41 Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden;
      and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet
      laid.<BR />
      42 There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation
      day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.<BR />

      3 Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus
      Christ were baptized into his death?<BR />
      4 Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that
      like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the
      Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.<BR />
      5 For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his
      death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:<BR />
      6 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that
      the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should
      not serve sin.<BR />

      death hath no more dominion over him.<BR />
