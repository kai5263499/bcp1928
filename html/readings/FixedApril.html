      13 When I was yet young, or ever went abroad, I desired wisdom
      openly in my prayer.<BR />
      14 I prayed for her before the temple, and will seek her out
      even to the end.<BR />
      15 Even from the flower till the grape was ripe hath my heart
      delighted in her: my foot went the right way, from my youth up
      sought I after her.<BR />
      16 I bowed down mine ear a little, and received her, and gat
      much learning.<BR />
      17 I profited therein, therefore will I ascribe the glory unto
      him that giveth me wisdom.<BR />
      18 For I purposed to do after her, and earnestly I followed that
      which is good; so shall I not be confounded.<BR />
      19 My soul hath wrestled with her, and in my doings I was exact:
      I stretched forth my hands to the heaven above, and bewailed
      my ignorances of her.<BR />
      20 I directed my soul unto her, and I found her in pureness:
      I have had my heart joined with her from the beginning, therefore
      shall I not be forsaken,<BR />
      2I My heart was troubled in seeking her: therefore have I gotten
      a good possession.<BR />
      22 The Lord hath given me a tongue for my reward, and I will
      praise him therewith.<BR />

      25 And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had
      fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname
      was Mark.<BR />
      1 Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets
      and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger,
      and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with
      Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.<BR />

      them, they sent them away.<BR />

      6 I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, which shall
      never hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of
      the LORD, keep not silence,<BR />
      7 And give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem
      a praise in the earth.<BR />
      8 The LORD hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his
      strength, Surely I will no more give thy corn to be meat for
      thine enemies; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy
      wine, for the which thou hast laboured:<BR />
      9 But they that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the
      LORD; and they that have brought it together shall drink it in
      the courts of my holiness.<BR />
      10 Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the
      people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones;
      lift up a standard for the people.<BR />
      11 Behold, the LORD hath proclaimed unto the end of the world,
      Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh;
      behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.<BR />

      4 For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for
      our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures
      might have hope.<BR />
      5 Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded
      one toward another according to Christ Jesus:<BR />
      6 That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the
      Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.<BR />
      7 Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us
      to the glory of God.<BR />
      8 Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision
      for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:<BR />
      9 And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it
      is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles,
      and sing unto thy name.<BR />
      10 And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.<BR />
      11 And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him
      all ye people.<BR />
      12 And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and
      he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the
      Gentiles trust.<BR />

      1 My son, if thou come to serve the Lord prepare thy soul for
      temptation.<BR />
      2 Set thy heart aright, and constantly endure, and make not haste
      in time of trouble.<BR />
      3 Cleave unto him, and depart not away that thou mayest be increased
      at thy last end.<BR />
      4 Whatsoever is brought upon thee take cheerfully, and be patient
      when thou art changed to a low estate.<BR />
      5 For gold is tried in the fire, and acceptable men in the furnace
      of adversity.<BR />
      6 Believe in him, and he will help thee; order thy way aright,
      and trust in him.<BR />
      7 Ye that fear the Lord, wait for his mercy; and go not aside,
      lest ye fall.<BR />
      8 Ye that fear the Lord, believe him; and your reward shall not
      fail.<BR />
      9 Ye that fear the Lord, hope for good, and for everlasting joy
      and mercy.<BR />
      10 Look at the generations of old, and see; did ever any trust
      in the Lord, and was confounded? or did any abide in his fear,
      and was forsaken? or whom did he ever despise, that called upon
      him?<BR />
      11 For the Lord is full of compassion and mercy, longsuffering,
      and very pitiful, and forgiveth sins, and saveth in time of affliction.<BR />

      1 I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ,
      who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his
      kingdom;<BR />
      2 Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove,
      rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor101210"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">3 For
      the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine;
      but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers,
      having itching ears;<BR />
      4 And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall
      be turned unto fables.<BR />
      5 But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work
      of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.<BR />
      6 For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure
      is at hand.<BR />
      7 I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have
      kept the faith:<BR />
      8 Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,
      which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day:
      and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.<BR />
      9 Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:<BR />
      10 For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world,
      and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus
      unto Dalmatia.<BR />
      11 Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee:
      for he is profitable to me for the ministry.<BR />
      16 At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook
      me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.<BR />
      17 Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me;
      that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the
      Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of
      the lion.<BR />
      18 And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will
      preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever
      and ever. Amen.<BR />
