      15 And the LORD saw it, and it displeased him that there was
      no judgment.<BR />
      16 And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there
      was no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto
      him; and his righteousness, it sustained him.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor218742"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">17 For
      he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation
      upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing,
      and was clad with zeal as a cloak.<BR />
      18 According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury
      to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands
      he will repay recompence.<BR />
      19 So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and
      his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come
      in like a flood, the spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard
      against him.<BR />
      20 And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn
      from transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD.<BR />
      21 As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the LORD;
      My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in
      thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the
      mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith
      the LORD, from henceforth and for ever.<BR />

      1 Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness
      of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent
      am bold toward you:<BR />
      2 But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present

      1 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in
      a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding
      great reward.<BR />
      2 And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I

      Damascus?<BR />
      3 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and,
      lo, one born in my house is mine heir.<BR />
      4 And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This
      shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of
      thine own bowels shall be thine heir.<BR />
      5 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward
      heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and
      he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.<BR />
      6 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.<BR />

      8 Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel
      with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be
      my camp.<BR />
      9 And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware

      come down.<BR />
      10 And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of
      God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not
      once nor twice.<BR />
      11 Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled
      for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them,
      Will ye not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?<BR />
      12 And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha,
      the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the
      words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.<BR />
      13 And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch
      him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.<BR />
      14 Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great
      host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.<BR />

      Ecclesiastes 5:8-20</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      8 If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting
      of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter:
      for he that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be
      higher than they.<BR />
      9 Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself
      is served by the field.<BR />
      10 He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver;
      nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity.<BR />
      11 When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and
      what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding
      of them with their eyes?<BR />
      12 The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little
      or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to
      sleep.<BR />
      13 There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely,
      riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.<BR />
      14 But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth
      a son, and there is nothing in his hand.<BR />
      15 As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return
      to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which
      he may carry away in his hand.<BR />
      16 And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came,
      so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for
      the wind?<BR />
      17 All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much
      sorrow and wrath with his sickness.<BR />
      18 Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one
      to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour
      that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which
      God giveth him: for it is his portion.<BR />

      15 Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle
      him in his talk.<BR />
      16 And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians,
      saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the
      way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou
      regardest not the person of men.<BR />
      17 Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give
      tribute unto Caesar, or not?<BR />
      18 But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt
      ye me, ye hypocrites?<BR />
      19 Show me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.<BR />
      20 And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor795249"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">21 They
      say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore
      unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things
      that are God's.<BR />
      22 When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left
      him, and went their way.<BR />
      23 The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there
      is no resurrection, and asked him,<BR />
      24 Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children,
      his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his
      brother.<BR />
      25 Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when
      he had married a wife, deceased, and having no issue, left his
      wife unto his brother:<BR />
      26 Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.<BR />
      27 And last of all the woman died also.<BR />
      28 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the
      seven? for they all had her.<BR />
      29 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing
      the scriptures, nor the power of God.<BR />
      30 For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given
      in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.<BR />
      31 But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not
      read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,<BR />
      32 I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God
      of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.<BR />
      33 And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at
      his doctrine.<BR />

      how shall we do?<BR />
      16 And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more
      than they that be with them.<BR />
      17 And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes,
      that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man;
      and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and
      chariots of fire round about Elisha.<BR />
      18 And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD,
      and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And
      he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.<BR />
      19 And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is
      this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom
      ye seek. But he led them to Samaria.<BR />
      20 And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that
      Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may
      see. And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold,
      they were in the midst of Samaria.<BR />

      34 But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees
      to silence, they were gathered together.<BR />
      35 Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question,
      tempting him, and saying,<BR />
      36 Master, which is the great commandment in the law?<BR />
      37 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with

      38 This is the first and great commandment.<BR />

      1 And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets,
      and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this box of oil
      in thine hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead:<BR />
      2 And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of
      Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise
      up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber;<BR />
      3 Then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head, and say,
      Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then
      open the door, and flee, and tarry not.<BR />
      4 So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead.<BR />
      5 And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting;
      and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said,
      Unto which of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain.<BR />
      6 And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil
      on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,
      I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD, even over
      Israel.<BR />
      10 And he opened the door, and fled.<BR />
      11 Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one
      said unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to
      thee? And he said unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication.<BR />
      12 And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus
      and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I have
      anointed thee king over Israel.<BR />
      13 Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put
      it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets,
      saying, Jehu is king.<BR />
      14 So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired
      against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramoth-gilead, he and all
      Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria.<BR />
      15 But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the
      wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael
      king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your minds, then let
      none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in
      Jezreel.<BR />
      16 So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram
      lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.<BR />

      Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged,

      which fear before him:<BR />
      13 But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he
      prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not
      before God.<BR />
      14 There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there
      be just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of
      the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth
      according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also

      17 And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he
      spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company.
      And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and
      let him say, Is it peace?<BR />
      18 So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus
      saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to
      do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying,
      The messenger came to them, but he cometh not again.<BR />
      19 Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them,
      and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered,
      What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.<BR />
      20 And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and
      cometh not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu
      the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.<BR />
      21 And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready.
      And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out,
      each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met
      him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.<BR />
      22 And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is
      it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms
      of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?<BR />
      23 And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah,
      There is treachery, O Ahaziah.<BR />
      24 And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram
      between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he
      sunk down in his chariot.<BR />
      25 Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him
      in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember
      how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father,
      the LORD laid this burden upon him;<BR />
      26 Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the
      blood of his sons, saith the LORD; and I will requite thee in
      this plat, saith the LORD. Now therefore take and cast him into
      the plat of ground, according to the word of the LORD.<BR />
      27 But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the
      way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said,
      Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the going up
      to Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died
      there.<BR />
      28 And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and
      buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.<BR />

      she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a
      window.<BR />
      31 And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace,

      32 And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is
      on my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.<BR />
      33 And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some
      of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and
      he trode her under foot.<BR />
      34 And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go,
      see now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king's
      daughter.<BR />
      35 And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than
      the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.<BR />
      36 Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This
      is the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Elijah
      the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat
      the flesh of Jezebel:<BR />

      1 And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was
      dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.<BR />
      2 But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah,
      took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's
      sons which were slain; and they hid him, even him and his nurse,
      in the bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not slain.<BR />
      3 And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years.
      And Athaliah did reign over the land.<BR />
      4 And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over
      hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to
      him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them,
      and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and showed
      them the king's son.<BR />
      9 And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things
      that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his
      men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should
      go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.<BR />
      10 And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king
      David's spears and shields, that were in the temple of the LORD.<BR />
      11 And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand,
      round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to
      the left corner of the temple, along by the altar and the temple.<BR />
      12 And he brought forth the king's son, and put the crown upon
      him, and gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and
      anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, God save
      the king.<BR />
      13 And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the
      people, she came to the people into the temple of the LORD.<BR />
      14 And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as
      the manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king,
      and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets:
      and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason.<BR />
      15 But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds,
      the officers of the host, and said unto them, Have her forth
      without the ranges: and him that followeth her kill with the
      sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house
      of the LORD.<BR />
      16 And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the
      which the horses came into the king's house: and there was she
      slain.<BR />
