      Hebrews 10:1-10</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not
      the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices
      which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto
      perfect.<BR />
      2 For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because
      that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience
      of sins.<BR />
      3 But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of
      sins every year.<BR />
      4 For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats
      should take away sins.<BR />
      5 Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice
      and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared
      me:<BR />
      6 In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no
      pleasure.<BR />
      7 Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written
      of me,) to do thy will, O God.<BR />
      8 Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings
      and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure
      therein; which are offered by the law;<BR />
      9 Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away
      the first, that he may establish the second.<BR />
      10 By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of
      the body of Jesus Christ once for all.<BR />

      21 And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto
      the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.<BR />
      22 But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will
      not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him,
      that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.<BR />
      23 And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee
      good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish
      his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she
      weaned him.<BR />
      24 And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with
      three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine,
      and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the
      child was young.<BR />
      25 And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.<BR />
      26 And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am
      the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.<BR />
      27 For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition
      which I asked of him:<BR />
      28 Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he
      liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD
      there.<BR />

      1 Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth
      nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;<BR />
      2 But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed
      of the father.<BR />
      3 Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the
      elements of the world:<BR />
      4 But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his
      Son, made of a woman, made under the law,<BR />
      5 To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive
      the adoption of sons.<BR />
      6 And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of
      his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.<BR />

      Romans 8:14-21</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the
      sons of God.<BR />
      15 For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;
      but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry,
      Abba, Father.<BR />
      16 The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we
      are the children of God:<BR />
      17 And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs
      with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be
      also glorified together.<BR />
      18 For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are
      not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed
      in us.<BR />
      19 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the
      manifestation of the sons of God.<BR />
      20 For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly,
      but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,<BR />
      21 Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the
      bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children
      of God.<BR />

      1 And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for
      Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill
      thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite:
      for I have provided me a king among his sons.<BR />
      2 And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill
      me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am
      come to sacrifice to the LORD.<BR />
      3 And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what
      thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name
      unto thee<BR />
      4 And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem.
      And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said,
      Comest thou peaceably?<BR />
      5 And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD:
      sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he
      sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.<BR />
      6 And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on
      Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD'S anointed is before him.<BR />
      7 But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance,
      or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him:
      for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward
      appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.<BR />
      8 Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel.
      And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.<BR />
      9 Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath
      the LORD chosen this.<BR />
      10 Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel.
      And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.<BR />
      11 And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And
      he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth
      the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for
      we will not sit down till he come hither.<BR />
      12 And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal
      of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD
      said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.<BR />
      13 Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the
      midst of his brethren: and the spirit of the LORD came upon David
      from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.<BR />

      to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build

      ever.<BR />

      Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing,
      but inwardly they are ravening wolves.<BR />
      16 Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of
      thorns, or figs of thistles?<BR />
      17 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt
      tree bringeth forth evil fruit.<BR />
      18 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt
      tree bring forth good fruit.<BR />
      19 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down,
      and cast into the fire.<BR />
      20 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.<BR />
      21 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter
      into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my
      Father which is in heaven.<BR />
      22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied
      in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy
      name done many wonderful works?<BR />
      23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart
      from me, ye that work iniquity.<BR />
      24 Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth
      them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house
      upon a rock:<BR />
      25 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds
      blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded
      upon a rock.<BR />
      26 And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth
      them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his
      house upon the sand:<BR />
      27 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds
      blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the
      fall of it.<BR />

      1 Samuel 12:1-5</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto
      your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king
      over you.<BR />
      2 And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old
      and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have
      walked before you from my childhood unto this day.<BR />
      3 Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and
      before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have
      I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or
      of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith?
      and I will restore it you.<BR />
      4 And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us,
      neither hast thou taken aught of any man's hand.<BR />
      5 And he said unto them, The LORD is witness against you, and
      his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found aught
      in my hand. And they answered, He is witness.<BR />

      Acts 20:17-35</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      17 And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders
      of the church.<BR />
      18 And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know,
      from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I
      have been with you at all seasons,<BR />
      19 Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many
      tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait
      of the Jews:<BR />
      20 And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you,
      but have shown you, and have taught you publicly, and from house
      to house,<BR />
      21 Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance
      toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.<BR />
      22 And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem,
      not knowing the things that shall befall me there:<BR />
      23 Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying
      that bonds and afflictions abide me.<BR />
      24 But none of these things move me, neither count I my life
      dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy,
      and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to
      testify the gospel of the grace of God.<BR />
      25 And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone
      preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.<BR />
      26 Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from
      the blood of all men.<BR />
      27 For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel
      of God.<BR />
      28 Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock,
      over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed
      the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.<BR />
      29 For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves
      enter in among you, not sparing the flock.<BR />
      30 Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse
      things, to draw away disciples after them.<BR />
      31 Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three
      years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.<BR />
      32 And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of
      his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an
      inheritance among all them which are sanctified.<BR />
      33 I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.<BR />
      34 Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered
      unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor436595"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">35 I
      have shown you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to
      support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus,
      how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.<BR />
