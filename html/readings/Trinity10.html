      1 All wisdom cometh from the Lord, and is with him for ever.<BR />
      2 Who can number the sand of the sea, and the drops of rain,
      and the days of eternity?<BR />
      3 Who can find out the height of heaven, and the breadth of the
      earth, and the deep, and wisdom?<BR />
      4 Wisdom hath been created before all things, and the understanding
      of prudence from everlasting.<BR />
      5 The word of God most high is the fountain of wisdom; and her
      ways are everlasting commandments.<BR />
      6 To whom hath the root of wisdom been revealed? or who hath
      known her wise counsels?<BR />
      7 [Unto whom hath the knowledge of wisdom been made manifest?
      and who hath understood her great experience?]<BR />

      is one wise and greatly to be feared, the Lord sitting upon his

      10 She is with all flesh according to his gift, and he hath given

      John 8:25-36</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      25 Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto
      them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.<BR />
      26 I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that
      sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which
      I have heard of him.<BR />
      27 They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.<BR />
      28 Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son
      of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing
      of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.<BR />
      29 And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me
      alone; for I do always those things that please him.<BR />
      30 As he spake these words, many believed on him.<BR />
      31 Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye
      continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;<BR />

      33 They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in
      bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?<BR />
      34 Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever
      committeth sin is the servant of sin.<BR />
      35 And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the
      Son abideth ever.<BR />

      1 Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen:<BR />
      2 Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the
      womb, which will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and
      thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.<BR />
      3 For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods
      upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and
      my blessing upon thine offspring:<BR />
      4 And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by
      the water courses.<BR />
      5 One shall say, I am the LORD'S; and another shall call himself
      by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand
      unto the LORD, and surname himself by the name of Israel.<BR />
      6 Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the
      LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside
      me there is no God.<BR />
      7 And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it
      in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the
      things that are coming, and shall come, let them show unto them.<BR />
      8 Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that
      time, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses. Is there
      a God beside me? yea, there is no God; I know not any.<BR />

      and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed

      23 Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done it: shout, ye lower

      Romans 12:1-9<BR />
      </FONT></B><A NAME="anchor1352268"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">1
      I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that
      ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto
      God, which is your reasonable service.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor1353043"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">2 And
      be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the
      renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and
      acceptable, and perfect, will of God.<BR />
      3 For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that
      is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought
      to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to
      every man the measure of faith.<BR />
      4 For as we have many members in one body, and all members have
      not the same office:<BR />
      5 So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members
      one of another.<BR />
      6 Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is
      given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the
      proportion of faith;<BR />
      7 Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth,
      on teaching;<BR />
      8 Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him
      do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that
      showeth mercy, with cheerfulness.<BR />
      9 Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil;
      cleave to that which is good.<BR />

      1 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto
      Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David,
      and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.<BR />
      2 And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home
      to his father's house.<BR />
      3 Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him
      as his own soul.<BR />
      4 And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him,
      and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and
      to his bow, and to his girdle.<BR />
      5 And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved
      himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he
      was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the
      sight of Saul's servants.<BR />
      6 And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from
      the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all
      cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with
      tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of music.<BR />

      the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul

      he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to
      me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more

      29 And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and
      Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two
      of his disciples,<BR />
      30 Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in the which
      at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never
      man sat: loose him, and bring him hither.<BR />
      31 And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye
      say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.<BR />
      32 And they that were sent went their way, and found even as
      he had said unto them.<BR />
      33 And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said
      unto them, Why loose ye the colt?<BR />
      34 And they said, The Lord hath need of him.<BR />
      35 And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments
      upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.<BR />
      36 And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.<BR />
      37 And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the
      mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to
      rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works
      that they had seen;<BR />

      for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD

      3 And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations

      13 For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world,
      was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through
      the righteousness of faith.<BR />
      14 For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void,
      and the promise made of none effect:<BR />
      15 Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there
      is no transgression.<BR />
      16 Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the
      end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only
      which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of
      Abraham; who is the father of us all,<BR />
      17 (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,)
      before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead,
      and calleth those things which be not as though they were.<BR />
      18 Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the
      father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So
      shall thy seed be.<BR />
      19 And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body
      now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet
      the deadness of Sarah's womb:<BR />
      20 He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but
      was strong in faith, giving glory to God;<BR />
      21 And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was
      able also to perform.<BR />
      22 And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.<BR />
      23 Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed
      to him;<BR />
      24 But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe
      on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;<BR />
      25 Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for
      our justification.<BR />

      1 And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before
      Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is
      my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?<BR />
      2 And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold,
      my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he
      will show it me: and why should my father hide this thing from
      me? it is not so.<BR />
      3 And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth
      that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not
      Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the LORD
      liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me
      and death.<BR />
      4 Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth,
      I will even do it for thee.<BR />
      5 And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, tomorrow is the new moon,
      and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me
      go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at
      even.<BR />
      6 If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked
      leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there
      is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.<BR />
      7 If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but
      if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by
      him.<BR />
      12 And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I
      have sounded my father about tomorrow any time, or the third
      day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send
      not unto thee, and show it thee;<BR />
      13 The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please
      my father to do thee evil, then I will show it thee, and send
      thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with
      thee, as he hath been with my father.<BR />
      14 And thou shalt not only while yet I live show me the kindness
      of the LORD, that I die not:<BR />
      15 But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house
      for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David
      every one from the face of the earth.<BR />
      16 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying,
      Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies.<BR />
      17 And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved
      him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.<BR />
      18 Then Jonathan said to David, Tomorrow is the new moon: and
      thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.<BR />
      19 And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down
      quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself
      when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone
      Ezel.<BR />
      20 And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though
      I shot at a mark.<BR />
      21 And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows.
      If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this
      side of thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to
      thee, and no hurt; as the LORD liveth.<BR />
      22 But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are
      beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.<BR />

      1 Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God
      through our Lord Jesus Christ:<BR />
      2 By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein
      we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor1412972"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">3 And
      not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that
      tribulation worketh patience;<BR />
      4 And patience, experience; and experience, hope:<BR />
      5 And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed
      abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.<BR />
      6 For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died
      for the ungodly.<BR />
      7 For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure
      for a good man some would even dare to die.<BR />
      8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were
      yet sinners, Christ died for us.<BR />
      9 Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall
      be saved from wrath through him.<BR />
      10 For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by
      the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be
      saved by his life.<BR />
      11 And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus
      Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.<BR />
      12 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death
      by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:<BR />
      13 (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed
      when there is no law.<BR />
      14 Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them
      that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression,
      who is the figure of him that was to come.<BR />
      15 But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through
      the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God,
      and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath
      abounded unto many.<BR />
      16 And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for
      the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is
      of many offences unto justification.<BR />
      17 For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more
      they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness
      shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)<BR />
      18 Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all
      men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the
      free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.<BR />
      19 For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so
      by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.<BR />
      20 Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But
      where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:<BR />
      21 That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign
      through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.<BR />

      24 So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was
      come, the king sat him down to eat meat.<BR />
      25 And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon
      a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's
      side, and David's place was empty.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor1419487"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">26 Nevertheless
      Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something
      hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.<BR />
      27 And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day
      of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto
      Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat,
      neither yesterday, nor today?<BR />
      28 And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of
      me to go to Bethlehem:<BR />
      29 And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a
      sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to
      be there: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let
      me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh
      not unto the king's table.<BR />
      30 Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said
      unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I
      know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion,
      and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?<BR />
      31 For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou
      shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send
      and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.<BR />
      32 And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him,
      Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?<BR />
      33 And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan
      knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.<BR />
      34 So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did
      eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for
      David, because his father had done him shame.<BR />
      35 And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out
      into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little
      lad with him.<BR />
      36 And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which
      I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.<BR />
      37 And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which
      Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is
      not the arrow beyond thee?<BR />
      38 And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay
      not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his
      master.<BR />
      39 But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew
      the matter.<BR />

      Luke 20:9-26</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      9 Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain
      man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went
      into a far country for a long time.<BR />
      10 And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that
      they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen
      beat him, and sent him away empty.<BR />
      11 And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also,
      and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.<BR />
      12 And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and
      cast him out.<BR />
      13 Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will
      send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they
      see him.<BR />
      14 But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves,
      saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance
      may be ours.<BR />
      15 So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What
      therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?<BR />
      16 He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give
      the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God
      forbid.<BR />
      17 And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written,
      The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the
      head of the corner?<BR />
      18 Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but
      on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.<BR />
      19 And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought
      to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived
      that he had spoken this parable against them.<BR />
      20 And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign
      themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words,
      that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of
      the governor.<BR />
      21 And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest
      and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any,
      but teachest the way of God truly:<BR />
      22 Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?<BR />
      23 But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why
      tempt ye me?<BR />
      24 Show me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They
      answered and said, Caesar's.<BR />
      25 And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things
      which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's.<BR />
      26 And they could not take hold of his words before the people:
      and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.<BR />

      1 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace
      may abound?<BR />
      2 God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer
      therein?<BR />
      3 Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus
      Christ were baptized into his death?<BR />
      4 Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that
      like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the
      Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.<BR />
      5 For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his
      death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:<BR />
      6 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that
      the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should
      not serve sin.<BR />
      7 For he that is dead is freed from sin.<BR />
      8 Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also
      live with him:<BR />
      9 Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more;
      death hath no more dominion over him.<BR />
      10 For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he
      liveth, he liveth unto God.<BR />
      11 Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto
      sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.<BR />
      12 Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should
      obey it in the lusts thereof.<BR />
      13 Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness
      unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive
      from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness
      unto God.<BR />
      14 For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under
      the law, but under grace.<BR />
      15 What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law,
      but under grace? God forbid.<BR />
      16 Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to
      obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto
      death, or of obedience unto righteousness?<BR />
      17 But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but
      ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was
      delivered you.<BR />
      18 Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.<BR />
      19 I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of
      your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness
      and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members
      servants to righteousness unto holiness.<BR />
      20 For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.<BR />
      21 What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now
      ashamed? for the end of those things is death.<BR />
      22 But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God,
      ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.<BR />
      23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal
      life through Jesus Christ our Lord.<BR />

      6 When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that
      were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah,
      having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing
      about him;)<BR />
      7 Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear
      now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you
      fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands,
      and captains of hundreds;<BR />
      8 That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none
      that showeth me that my son hath made a league with the son of
      Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or showeth
      unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to
      lie in wait, as at this day?<BR />
      9 Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants
      of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech
      the son of Ahitub.<BR />
      10 And he inquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals,
      and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.<BR />
      11 Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of
      Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in
      Nob: and they came all of them to the king.<BR />
      12 And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered,
      Here I am, my lord.<BR />
      13 And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me,
      thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread,
      and a sword, and hast inquired of God for him, that he should
      rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?<BR />
      14 Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so
      faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king's
      son-in-law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine
      house?<BR />
      15 Did I then begin to inquire of God for him? be it far from
      me: let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to
      all the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all
      this, less or more.<BR />
      16 And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou,
      and all thy father's house.<BR />
      17 And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn,
      and slay the priests of the LORD; because their hand also is
      with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not show
      it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their
      hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD.<BR />
      18 And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests.
      And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and
      slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen
      ephod.<BR />
      19 And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of
      the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen,

      20 And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named
      Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.<BR />
      21 And Abiathar showed David that Saul had slain the LORD'S priests.<BR />
      22 And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg
      the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have
      occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father's house.<BR />
      23 Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life
      seeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard.<BR />

      27 Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that
      there is any resurrection; and they asked him,<BR />
      28 Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother
      die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother
      should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.<BR />
      29 There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a
      wife, and died without children.<BR />
      30 And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.<BR />
      31 And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also:
      and they left no children, and died.<BR />
      32 Last of all the woman died also.<BR />
      33 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for
      seven had her to wife.<BR />
      34 And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world
      marry, and are given in marriage:<BR />
      35 But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world,
      and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given
      in marriage:<BR />
      36 Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the
      angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the
      resurrection.<BR />
      37 Now that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush,
      when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac,
      and the God of Jacob.<BR />
      38 For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all
      live unto him.<BR />
      39 Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast
      well said.<BR />
      40 And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.<BR />

      1 Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,)
      how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?<BR />
      2 For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to
      her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead,
      she is loosed from the law of her husband.<BR />
      3 So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another
      man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be
      dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress,
      though she be married to another man.<BR />
      4 Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law
      by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another,
      even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring
      forth fruit unto God.<BR />
      5 For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were
      by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto
      death.<BR />
      6 But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein
      we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and
      not in the oldness of the letter.<BR />
      7 What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I
      had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust,
      except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.<BR />
      8 But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me
      all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.<BR />
      9 For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment
      came, sin revived, and I died.<BR />
      10 And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to
      be unto death.<BR />
      11 For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me,
      and by it slew me.<BR />

      7 And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul
      said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in,
      by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.<BR />
      8 And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down
      to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.<BR />
      9 And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against
      him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.<BR />
      10 Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly
      heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city
      for my sake.<BR />

      12 Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my
      men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver
      thee up.<BR />
      13 Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose
      and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could
      go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah;
      and he forbare to go forth.<BR />
      14 And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained
      in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him
      every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.<BR />
      15 And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and
      David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.<BR />
      16 And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the
      wood, and strengthened his hand in God.<BR />
      17 And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father
      shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and
      I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.<BR />
      18 And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode

      as the grapegleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to
      eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit.<BR />
      2 The good man is perished out of the earth: and there is none
      upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt
      every man his brother with a net.<BR />
      3 That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince
      asketh, and the judge asketh for a reward; and the great man,
      he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.<BR />
      4 The best of them is as a brier: the most upright is sharper
      than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation
      cometh; now shall be their perplexity.<BR />
      5 Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide:

      3 Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried
      him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those
      that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.<BR />
      4 And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came
      and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together,
      and they pitched in Giboa.<BR />
      5 And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid,
      and his heart greatly trembled.<BR />
      6 And when Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not,
      neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.<BR />
      7 Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath
      a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her.
      And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath
      a familiar spirit at En-dor.<BR />
      8 And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he
      went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night:
      and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit,
      and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee.<BR />
      9 And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul
      hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits,
      and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou
      a snare for my life, to cause me to die?<BR />
      10 And Saul sware to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth,
      there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.<BR />
      11 Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And
      he said, Bring me up Samuel.<BR />
      12 And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice:
      and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me?
      for thou art Saul.<BR />
      13 And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest
      thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out
      of the earth.<BR />
      14 And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An
      old man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul
      perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to
      the ground, and bowed himself.<BR />
      15 And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring
      me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines
      make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth
      me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have
      called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall
      do.<BR />

      14 Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage,
      which dwell solitarily in the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let
      them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.<BR />
      15 According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt
      will I show unto him marvellous things.<BR />
      16 The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might:
      they shall lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears shall
      be deaf.<BR />

      shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their
      holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the LORD
      our God, and shall fear because of thee.<BR />
      18 Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and
      passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage?
      he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in

      Lesson<BR />
      Romans 8:1-17</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in
      Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.<BR />
      2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made
      me free from the law of sin and death.<BR />
      3 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through
      the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful
      flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:<BR />
      4 That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us,
      who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.<BR />
      5 For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the
      flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.<BR />
      6 For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded
      is life and peace.<BR />
      7 Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not
      subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.<BR />
      8 So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.<BR />
      9 But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that
      the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit
      of Christ, he is none of his.<BR />
      10 And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin;
      but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.<BR />
      11 But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead
      dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also
      quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.<BR />
      12 Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to
      live after the flesh.<BR />
      13 For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through
      the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.<BR />
      14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the
      sons of God.<BR />
      15 For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;
      but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry,
      Abba, Father.<BR />
      16 The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we
      are the children of God:<BR />
      17 And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs
      with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be
      also glorified together.<BR />
