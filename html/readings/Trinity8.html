      18 The fear of the LORD is a crown of wisdom,making peace and
      perfect health to flourish; both which are the gifts of God:
      and it enlargeth their rejoicing that love him.<BR />
      19 Wisdom raineth down skill and knowledge of understanding,
      and exalteth them to honour that hold her fast.<BR />
      20 The root of wisdom is to fear the LORD, and the branches thereof
      are long life.<BR />
      21 The fear of the LORD driveth away sins: and where it is present,
      it turneth away wrath.<BR />
      22 A furious man cannot be justified; for the sway of his fury
      shall be his destruction.<BR />
      23 A patient man will bear for a time, and afterward joy shall
      spring up unto him.<BR />
      24 He will hide his words for a time, and the lips of many shall
      declare his wisdom.<BR />
      25 The parables of knowledge are in the treasures of wisdom:
      but godliness is an abomination to a sinner.<BR />
      26 If thou desire wisdom, keep the commandments, and the LORD
      shall give her unto thee.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor205413"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">27 For
      the fear of the LORD is wisdom and instruction: and faith and

      John 7:14-24</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      14 Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple,
      and taught.<BR />
      15 And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters,
      having never learned?<BR />
      16 Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but
      his that sent me.<BR />
      17 If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine,
      whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.<BR />
      18 He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he
      that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no
      unrighteousness is in him.<BR />
      19 Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth
      the law? Why go ye about to kill me?<BR />
      20 The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth
      about to kill thee?<BR />
      21 Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and
      ye all marvel.<BR />
      22 Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it
      is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise
      a man.<BR />
      23 If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the
      law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because
      I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?<BR />

      22 Wisdom is according to her name, and she is not manifest unto
      many.<BR />
      23 Give ear, my son, receive my advice, and refuse not my counsel,<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor216347"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">24 And
      put thy feet into her fetters, and thy neck into her chain.<BR />

      26 Come unto her with thy whole heart, and keep her ways with
      all thy power.<BR />
      27 Search, and seek, and she shall be made known unto thee: and
      when thou hast got hold of her, let her not go.<BR />
      28 For at the last thou shalt find her rest, and that shall be
      turned to thy joy.<BR />
      29 Then shall her fetters be a strong defence for thee, and her
      chains a robe of glory.<BR />
      30 For there is a golden ornament upon her, and her bands are
      purple lace.<BR />
      31 Thou shalt put her on as a robe of honour, and shalt put her
      about thee as a crown of joy.<BR />
      32 My son, if thou wilt, thou shalt be taught: and if thou wilt
      apply thy mind, thou shalt be prudent.<BR />
      33 If thou love to hear, thou shalt receive understanding: and
      if thou bow thine ear, thou shalt be wise.<BR />
      34 Stand in the multitude of the elders; and cleave unto him
      that is wise.<BR />
      35 Be willing to hear every godly discourse; and let not the
      parables of understanding escape thee.<BR />
      36 And if thou seest a man of understanding, get thee betimes
      unto him, and let thy foot wear the steps of his door.<BR />
      37 Let thy mind be upon the ordinances of the LORD, and meditate
      continually in his commandments: he shall establish then hearts,
      and give thee wisdom at thine own desire.<BR />

      certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him
      into her house.<BR />
      39 And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus'
      feet, and heard his word.<BR />
      40 But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him,
      and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me
      to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.<BR />
      41 And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou

      1 Samuel 11:1-13 </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh-gilead:
      and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with
      us, and we will serve thee.<BR />
      2 And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will
      I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right
      eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.<BR />
      3 And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days'
      respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel:
      and then, if there be no man to save us, we will come out to
      thee.<BR />
      4 Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings
      in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their
      voices, and wept.<BR />
      5 And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and
      Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told
      him the tidings of the men of Jabesh.<BR />
      6 And the spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings,
      and his anger was kindled greatly.<BR />
      7 And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent
      them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers,
      saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel,
      so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell
      on the people, and they came out with one consent.<BR />
      8 And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel
      were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.<BR />
      9 And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye
      say unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, Tomorrow, by that time the
      sun be hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came and showed
      it to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.<BR />
      10 Therefore the men of Jabesh said, Tomorrow we will come out
      unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto
      you.<BR />
      11 And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three
      companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning
      watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and
      it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so
      that two of them were not left together.<BR />
      12 And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall
      Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.<BR />
      13 And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this
      day: for today the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel.<BR />

      1 Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to
      hear him.<BR />
      2 And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth
      sinners, and eateth with them.<BR />
      3 And he spake this parable unto them, saying,<BR />

      Daniel 6:1-8</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty
      princes, which should be over the whole kingdom;<BR />
      2 And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel was first:
      that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the king
      should have no damage.<BR />
      3 Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes,
      because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought
      to set him over the whole realm.<BR />
      4 Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against
      Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion
      nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any
      error or fault found in him.<BR />
      5 Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against
      this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law
      of his God.<BR />
      6 Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the
      king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.<BR />
      7 All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes,
      the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to
      establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever
      shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save
      of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.<BR />
      8 Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that

      1 Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for
      thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for
      himself:<BR />
      2 I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer
      for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof
      I am accused of the Jews:<BR />
      3 Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs
      and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee
      to hear me patiently.<BR />
      4 My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among
      mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;<BR />
      5 Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that
      after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.<BR />
      6 And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made
      of God unto our fathers:<BR />
      7 Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God
      day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa,
      I am accused of the Jews.<BR />
      8 Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that
      God should raise the dead?<BR />
      9 I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things
      contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.<BR />
      10 Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints
      did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief
      priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against
      them.<BR />
      11 And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled
      them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I
      persecuted them even unto strange cities.<BR />
      12 Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission
      from the chief priests,<BR />
      13 At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above
      the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which
      journeyed with me.<BR />
      14 And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice
      speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul,
      why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against
      the pricks.<BR />
      15 And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom
      thou persecutest.<BR />
      16 But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto
      thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness
      both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things
      in the which I will appear unto thee;<BR />
      17 Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto
      whom now I send thee,<BR />
      18 To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light,
      and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness
      of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith
      that is in me.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor245841"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">19 Whereupon,
      O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:<BR />
      20 But showed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem,
      and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles,
      that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for
      repentance.<BR />
      21 For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went
      about to kill me.<BR />
      22 Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this
      day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things
      than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:<BR />
      23 That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first
      that should rise from the dead, and should show light unto the
      people, and to the Gentiles.<BR />

      them his living.<BR />
      13 And not many days after the younger son gathered all together,
      and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his
      substance with riotous living.<BR />
      14 And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in
      that land; and he began to be in want.<BR />
      15 And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country;
      and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.<BR />
      16 And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that
      the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.<BR />
      17 And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants
      of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with
      hunger!<BR />
      18 I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father,
      I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,<BR />
      19 And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one
      of thy hired servants.<BR />
      20 And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet
      a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and
      ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.<BR />
      21 And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven,
      and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.<BR />
      22 But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best
      robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes
      on his feet:<BR />
      23 And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us
      eat, and be merry:<BR />
      24 For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost,
      and is found. And they began to be merry.<BR />
      25 Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew
      nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing.<BR />
      26 And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things
      meant.<BR />
      27 And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father
      hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe
      and sound.<BR />
      28 And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his
      father out, and entreated him.<BR />
      29 And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years
      do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment:
      and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with
      my friends:<BR />
      30 But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured
      thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted
      calf.<BR />
      31 And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all
      that I have is thine.<BR />
      32 It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this
      thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is
      found.<BR />

      9 Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.<BR />
      10 Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went
      into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward
      Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed,
      and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.<BR />
      11 Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making
      supplication before his God.<BR />
      12 Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning
      the king's decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every
      man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty
      days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?
      The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the
      law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.<BR />
      13 Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel,
      which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth
      not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh
      his petition three times a day.<BR />
      14 Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased
      with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and
      he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him.<BR />
      15 Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the
      king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is,
      That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be
      changed.<BR />

      24 And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud
      voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make
      thee mad.<BR />
      25 But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth
      the words of truth and soberness.<BR />
      26 For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak
      freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden
      from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.<BR />
      27 King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou
      believest.<BR />
      28 Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to
      be a Christian.<BR />
      29 And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also
      all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such
      as I am, except these bonds.<BR />
      30 And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor,
      and Bernice, and they that sat with them:<BR />
      31 And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves,
      saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.<BR />
      32 Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set
      at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.<BR />
      1 And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy,
      they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named
      Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band.<BR />
      2 And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning
      to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian
      of Thessalonica, being with us.<BR />
      3 And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously
      entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to
      refresh himself.<BR />
      4 And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus,
      because the winds were contrary.<BR />
      5 And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia,
      we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.<BR />
      6 And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing
      into Italy; and he put us therein.<BR />
      7 And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come
      over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under
      Crete, over against Salmone;<BR />
      8 And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The
      fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.<BR />

      1 And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich
      man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that
      he had wasted his goods.<BR />
      2 And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear
      this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest
      be no longer steward.<BR />
      3 Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for
      my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to
      beg I am ashamed.<BR />
      4 I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship,
      they may receive me into their houses.<BR />
      5 So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and
      said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?<BR />
      6 And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him,
      Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.<BR />
      7 Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said,
      An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy
      bill, and write fourscore.<BR />
      8 And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done
      wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation
      wiser than the children of light.<BR />
      9 And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon
      of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you
      into everlasting habitations.<BR />
      10 He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also
      in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in

      11 If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous
      mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?<BR />

      14 And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these

      17 And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den;
      and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet
      of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning
      Daniel.<BR />
      18 Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting:
      neither were instruments of music brought before him: and his
      sleep went from him.<BR />
      19 Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in
      haste unto the den of lions.<BR />
      20 And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice
      unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel,
      servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually,
      able to deliver thee from the lions?<BR />
      21 Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.<BR />
      22 My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths,
      that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency
      was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no
      hurt.<BR />
      23 Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that

      9 Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous,
      because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,<BR />
      10 And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will
      be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship,

      the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship,

      12 And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the
      more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they
      might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven
      of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.<BR />
      13 And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had
      obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by
      Crete.<BR />
      14 But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind,
      called Euroclydon.<BR />
      15 And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the
      wind, we let her drive.<BR />
      16 And running under a certain island which is called Clauda,
      we had much work to come by the boat:<BR />
      17 Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding
      the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands,
      strake sail, and so were driven.<BR />
      18 And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day
      they lightened the ship;<BR />

      20 And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and
      no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved
      was then taken away.<BR />
      21 But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of
      them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not
      have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.<BR />
      22 And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall
      be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship.<BR />

      am, and whom I serve,<BR />
      24 Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar:

      25 Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that

      26 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf
      fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot;
      neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.<BR />
      27 Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest
      send him to my father's house:<BR />
      28 For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest
      they also come into this place of torment.<BR />
      29 Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets;
      let them hear them.<BR />
      30 And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them
      from the dead, they will repent.<BR />
      31 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets,
      neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.<BR />

      Esther 2:5-8, 17-23</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      5 Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name
      was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of
      Kish, a Benjamite;<BR />
      6 Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity
      which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom
      Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.<BR />
      7 And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter:
      for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair
      and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were
      dead, took for his own daughter.<BR />
      8 So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree
      was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto
      Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was
      brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of Hegai,
      keeper of the women.<BR />
      17 And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained
      grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that
      he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead
      of Vashti.<BR />
      18 Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and
      his servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the
      provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.<BR />
      19 And when the virgins were gathered together the second time,
      then Mordecai sat in the king's gate.<BR />
      20 Esther had not yet shown her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai
      had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai,
      like as when she was brought up with him.<BR />
      21 In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two
      of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which
      kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king
      Ahasuerus.<BR />
      22 And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther
      the queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai's
      name.<BR />
      23 And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found
      out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written
      in the book of the chronicles before the king.<BR />

      Acts 27:27-44</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      27 But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven
      up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that
      they drew near to some country;<BR />
      28 And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had
      gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen
      fathoms.<BR />
      29 Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast
      four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.<BR />
      30 And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when
      they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though
      they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,<BR />
      31 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these
      abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.<BR />
      32 Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her
      fall off.<BR />
      33 And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to
      take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have
      tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.<BR />
      34 Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your
      health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any
      of you.<BR />
      35 And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks
      to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he
      began to eat.<BR />
      36 Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some
      meat.<BR />
      37 And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and
      sixteen souls.<BR />
      38 And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and
      cast out the wheat into the sea.<BR />
      39 And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered
      a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded,
      if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.<BR />
      40 And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves
      unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoisted up the
      mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.<BR />
      41 And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the
      ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable,
      but the hinderpart was broken with the violence of the waves.<BR />
      42 And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest
      any of them should swim out, and escape.<BR />
      43 But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their
      purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast
      themselves first into the sea, and get to land:<BR />
      44 And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of
      the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe
      to land.<BR />

      1 Samuel 15:10-23</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      10 Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,<BR />
      11 It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he
      is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments.
      And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night.<BR />
      12 And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it
      was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he
      set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone
      down to Gilgal.<BR />
      13 And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be
      thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.<BR />
      14 And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep
      in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?<BR />
      15 And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites:
      for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen,
      to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly
      destroyed.<BR />
      16 Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what
      the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say
      on.<BR />
      17 And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight,
      wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the
      LORD anointed thee king over Israel?<BR />
      18 And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly
      destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until
      they be consumed.<BR />
      19 Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD,
      but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of
      the LORD?<BR />
      20 And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of
      the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have
      brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the
      Amalekites.<BR />
      21 But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief
      of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice
      unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.<BR />
      22 And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings
      and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold,
      to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat
      of rams.<BR />
      23 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness
      is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word
      of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.<BR />

      offences will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come!<BR />
      2 It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his

      1 After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son
      of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat
      above all the princes that were with him.<BR />
      2 And all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate,
      bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning
      him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence.<BR />
      3 Then the king's servants, which were in the king's gate, said
      unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king's commandment?<BR />
      4 Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he
      hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether
      Mordecai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he
      was a Jew.<BR />
      5 And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence,
      then was Haman full of wrath.<BR />
      6 And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they
      had shown him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought
      to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom
      of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.<BR />
      7 In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth
      year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before
      Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth
      month, that is, the month Adar.<BR />
      8 And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people
      scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces
      of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither
      keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's
      profit to suffer them.<BR />
      9 If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed:
      and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of
      those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into
      the king's treasuries.<BR />
      10 And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto
      Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.<BR />
      11 And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee,
      the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.<BR />
      12 Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day
      of the first month, and there was written according to all that
      Haman had commanded unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors
      that were over every province, and to the rulers of every people
      of every province according to the writing thereof, and to every
      people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was
      it written, and sealed with the king's ring.<BR />

      1 And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island
      was called Melita.<BR />
      2 And the barbarous people showed us no little kindness: for
      they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the
      present rain, and because of the cold.<BR />
      3 And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them
      on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened
      on his hand.<BR />
      4 And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his
      hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer,
      whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth
      not to live.<BR />
      5 And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.<BR />

      they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead
      suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no
      harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he
      was a god.<BR />
      7 In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the
      island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us
      three days courteously.<BR />
      8 And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of
      a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed,
      and laid his hands on him, and healed him.<BR />
      9 So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the

      10 Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed,
      they laded us with such things as were necessary.<BR />
      11 And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria,
      which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.<BR />
      12 And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.<BR />
      13 And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium:
      and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day
      to Puteoli:<BR />
      14 Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them
      seven days: and so we went toward Rome.<BR />
      15 And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came
      to meet us as far as Appiiforum, and The three taverns: whom
      when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.<BR />

      25 Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again

      26 And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for
      thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected
      thee from being king over Israel.<BR />
      27 And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the
      skirt of his mantle, and it rent.<BR />
      28 And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of
      Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of

      29 And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for

      Lesson<BR />
      Esther 4:1, 5-17</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his
      clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the
      midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;<BR />
      5 Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains,
      whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment
      to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was.<BR />
      6 So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city,
      which was before the king's gate.<BR />
      7 And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and
      of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the
      king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.<BR />
      8 Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that
      was given at Shushan to destroy them, to show it unto Esther,
      and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should
      go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make
      request before him for her people.<BR />
      9 And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.<BR />
      10 Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto
      Mordecai;<BR />
      11 All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces,
      do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto
      the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one
      law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king
      shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have
      not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.<BR />
      12 And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.<BR />
      13 Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself
      that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the
      Jews.<BR />
      14 For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then
      shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from
      another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed:
      and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such
      a time as this?<BR />
      15 Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,<BR />
      16 Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan,
      and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night
      or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will
      I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and
      if I perish, I perish.<BR />
      17 So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther
      had commanded him.<BR />

      Lesson<BR />
      Acts 28:16-31</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      16 And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners
      to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by
      himself with a soldier that kept him.<BR />
      17 And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the
      chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together,
      he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed
      nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was
      I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.<BR />
      18 Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because
      there was no cause of death in me.<BR />
      19 But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal
      unto Caesar; not that I had aught to accuse my nation of.<BR />
      20 For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you,
      and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I
      am bound with this chain.<BR />
      21 And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of
      Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came
      showed or spake any harm of thee.<BR />
      22 But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning
      this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.<BR />
      23 And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to
      him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the
      kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of
      the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till
      evening.<BR />
      24 And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed
      not.<BR />
      25 And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed,
      after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost
      by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,<BR />
      26 Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear,
      and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor373508"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">27 For
      the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull
      of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should
      see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand
      with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal
      them.<BR />
      28 Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God
      is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.<BR />
      29 And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had
      great reasoning among themselves.<BR />
      30 And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and
      received all that came in unto him,<BR />
      31 Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which
      concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding
      him.<BR />
