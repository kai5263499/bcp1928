      any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith
      the LORD. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the LORD.<BR />
      25 I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in
      my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.<BR />
      26 How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy
      lies? yea, they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart;<BR />
      27 Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their
      dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers
      have forgotten my name for Baal.<BR />
      28 The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he
      that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is
      the chaff to the wheat? saith the LORD.<BR />
      29 Is not my word like as a fire? saith the LORD; and like a
      hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?<BR />

      their tongues, and say, He saith.<BR />
      32 Behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, saith
      the LORD, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their
      lies, and by their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded
      them: therefore they shall not profit this people at all, saith

      Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad
      is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which
      go in thereat:<BR />
      14 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth
      unto life, and few there be that find it.<BR />
      21 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter
      into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my
      Father which is in heaven.<BR />
      22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied
      in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy
      name done many wonderful works?<BR />

      11 For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is
      not hidden from thee, neither is it far off.<BR />
      12 It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go

      13 Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who
      shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may
      hear it, and do it?<BR />
      14 But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in

      15 See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death
      and evil;<BR />
      16 In that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God,
      to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes
      and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and the
      LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest

      1 Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that
      his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto
      the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he
      loved them unto the end.<BR />
      2 And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart
      of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;<BR />
      3 Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his
      hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;<BR />
      4 He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took
      a towel, and girded himself.<BR />
      5 After that he poureth water into a basin, and began to wash
      the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith
      he was girded.<BR />
      6 Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord,
      dost thou wash my feet?<BR />
      7 Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not
      now; but thou shalt know hereafter.<BR />
      8 Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus
      answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.<BR />
      9 Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also
      my hands and my head.<BR />
      10 Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to
      wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but
      not all.<BR />
      11 For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are
      not all clean.<BR />
      12 So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments,
      and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have
      done to you?<BR />
      13 Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.<BR />
      14 If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye
      also ought to wash one another's feet.<BR />
      15 For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have
      done to you.<BR />
      16 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater
      than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent
      him.<BR />
      17 If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.<BR />
      34 A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another;
      as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.<BR />

      2 And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to
      the Amorites.<BR />
      3 And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many:
      and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.<BR />
      4 And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company
      lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the
      grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the
      Moabites at that time.<BR />
      5 He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to
      Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of
      his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come
      out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and
      they abide over against me:<BR />
      6 Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for
      they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that
      we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land:
      for I wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom
      thou cursest is cursed.<BR />
      7 And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with
      the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam,
      and spake unto him the words of Balak.<BR />
      8 And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring
      you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes
      of Moab abode with Balaam.<BR />
      9 And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with
      thee?<BR />
      10 And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of
      Moab, hath sent unto me, saying,<BR />
      11 Behold, there is a people come out of Egypt, which covereth
      the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure
      I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.<BR />
      12 And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou
      shalt not curse the people: for they are blessed.<BR />
      13 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes
      of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give
      me leave to go with you.<BR />
      14 And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak,
      and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.<BR />

      21 And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising
      of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of
      the angel before he was conceived in the womb.<BR />
      22 And when the days of her purification according to the law
      of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to
      present him to the Lord;<BR />
      23 (As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that
      openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)<BR />
      24 And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in
      the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.<BR />
      25 And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was
      Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the
      consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.<BR />
      26 And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should
      not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.<BR />
      27 And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents
      brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of
      the law,<BR />
      28 Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,<BR />
      29 Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according
      to thy word:<BR />
      30 For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,<BR />
      31 Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;<BR />
      32 A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people
      Israel.<BR />
      33 And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which
      were spoken of him.<BR />
      34 And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold,
      this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel;
      and for a sign which shall be spoken against;<BR />
      35 (Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that
      the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.<BR />
      36 And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel,
      of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with
      an husband seven years from her virginity;<BR />
      37 And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which
      departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and
      prayers night and day.<BR />
      38 And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the
      Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption
      in Jerusalem.<BR />
      39 And when they had performed all things according to the law
      of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.<BR />
      40 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with
      wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.<BR />

      1 Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son
      of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem
      in the name of the God of Israel, even unto them.<BR />
      2 Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the
      son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is
      at Jerusalem: and with them were the prophets of God helping
      them.<BR />
      6 The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the
      river, and Shethar-boznai, and his companions the Apharsachites,
      which were on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king:<BR />
      7 They sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto
      Darius the king, all peace.<BR />
      8 Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of
      Judea, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great
      stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth
      fast on, and prospereth in their hands.<BR />
      9 Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who commanded
      you to build this house, and to make up these walls?<BR />
      10 We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might
      write the names of the men that were the chief of them.<BR />
      11 And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants
      of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was
      builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded
      and set up.<BR />
      12 But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven
      unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the
      king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and
      carried the people away into Babylon.<BR />
      13 But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same
      king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.<BR />
      14 And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God,
      which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem,
      and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus
      the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered
      unto one, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;<BR />
      15 And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into
      the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be
      builded in his place.<BR />
      16 Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of
      the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even
      until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not finished.<BR />
      17 Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search
      made in the king's treasure house, which is there at Babylon,
      whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to
      build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his
      pleasure to us concerning this matter.<BR />

      1 And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against
      the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,<BR />
      2 And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that
      if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women,
      he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.<BR />
      3 And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there
      shined round about him a light from heaven:<BR />
      4 And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him,
      Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?<BR />
      5 And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus
      whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the
      pricks.<BR />
      6 And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou
      have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into
      the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.<BR />
      7 And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing
      a voice, but seeing no man.<BR />
      8 And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened,
      he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him
      into Damascus.<BR />
      9 And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor
      drink.<BR />
      10 And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias;
      and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold,
      I am here, Lord.<BR />
      11 And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street
      which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for
      one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,<BR />
      12 And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and
      putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight.<BR />
      13 Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this
      man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:<BR />
      14 And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind
      all that call on thy name.<BR />
      15 But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen
      vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings,
      and the children of Israel:<BR />
      16 For I will show him how great things he must suffer for my
      name's sake.<BR />
      17 And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and
      putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus,
      that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent
      me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with
      the Holy Ghost.<BR />
      18 And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales:
      and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.<BR />
      19 And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was
      Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.<BR />

      15 And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable
      than they.<BR />
      16 And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak
      the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from
      coming unto me:<BR />
      17 For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will
      do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee,
      curse me this people.<BR />
      18 And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If
      Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot
      go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.<BR />
      19 Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night,
      that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more.<BR />
      20 And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the
      men come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the
      word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.<BR />
      21 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and
      went with the princes of Moab.<BR />
      36 And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to
      meet him unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon,
      which is in the utmost coast.<BR />
      37 And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto
      thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not
      able indeed to promote thee to honour?<BR />
      38 And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have
      I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth
      in my mouth, that shall I speak.<BR />
      39 And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjath-huzoth.<BR />
      40 And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and

      1 Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in
      the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.<BR />
      2 And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the
      province of the Medes, a roll, and therein was a record thus
      written:<BR />
      3 In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king
      made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the
      house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifices, and
      let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof
      threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore cubits;<BR />
      4 With three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and
      let the expenses be given out of the king's house:<BR />
      5 And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of
      God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which
      is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought
      again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to his
      place, and place them in the house of God.<BR />
      6 Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shethar-boznai,
      and your companions the Apharsachites, which are beyond the river,
      be ye far from thence:<BR />
      7 Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of
      the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in
      his place.<BR />
      8 Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of
      these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the
      king's goods, even of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith
      expenses be given unto these men, that they be not hindered.<BR />
      9 And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and
      rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven,
      wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the
      priests which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day
      without fail:<BR />
      10 That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God
      of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.<BR />
      11 Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this
      word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set
      up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill
      for this.<BR />
      12 And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy
      all kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter and
      to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius
      have made a decree; let it be done with speed.<BR />

      he is the Son of God.<BR />
      21 But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this
      he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem,
      and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound
      unto the chief priests?<BR />
      22 But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the

      23 And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel
      to kill him:<BR />
      24 But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched

      25 Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by

      26 And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself
      to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed
      not that he was a disciple.<BR />
      27 But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and

      41 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam,
      and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence
      he might see the utmost part of the people.<BR />
      1 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and
      prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.<BR />
      2 And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered
      on every altar a bullock and a ram.<BR />
      3 And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and
      I will go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatsoever
      he showeth me I will tell thee. And he went to an high place.<BR />
      4 And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven
      altars, and I have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram.<BR />
      5 And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return
      unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.<BR />
      6 And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice,
      he, and all the princes of Moab.<BR />
      7 And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab
      hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east,

      8 How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I
      defy, whom the LORD hath not defied?<BR />
      9 For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills
      I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not

      2 Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God
      came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.<BR />
      3 And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the
      baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor2321194"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">4 As
      it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet,

      5 Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall
      be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the
      rough ways shall be made smooth;<BR />
      6 And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.<BR />
      7 Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized
      of him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from
      the wrath to come?<BR />
      8 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin
      not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father:
      for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise
      up children unto Abraham.<BR />
      9 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every
      tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down,
      and cast into the fire.<BR />
      10 And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?<BR />
      11 He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats,
      let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat,
      let him do likewise.<BR />
      12 Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him,
      Master, what shall we do?<BR />
      13 And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed
      you.<BR />
      14 And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what
      shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither
      accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages.<BR />
      15 And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in
      their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not;<BR />
      16 John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you
      with water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose
      shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the
      Holy Ghost and with fire:<BR />
      17 Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his
      floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff
      he will burn with fire unquenchable.<BR />
      18 And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto
      the people.<BR />
      19 But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias
      his brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod
      had done,<BR />
      20 Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison.<BR />
      21 Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that
      Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,<BR />
      22 And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove
      upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art
      my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.<BR />

      36 Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which

      had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring

      made, while she was with them.<BR />

      place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the
      utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me
      them from thence.<BR />
      14 And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of
      Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram
      on every altar.<BR />
      15 And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering,
      while I meet the LORD yonder.<BR />
      16 And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and
      said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus.<BR />
      17 And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering,
      and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What
      hath the LORD spoken?<BR />
      18 And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and
      hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:<BR />

      20 Behold, I have received commandment to bless: and he hath
      blessed: and I cannot reverse it.<BR />

      1 And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan,
      and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,<BR />
      2 Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he
      did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered.<BR />
      3 And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command
      this stone that it be made bread.<BR />
      4 And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall
      not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.<BR />
      5 And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, showed
      unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.<BR />
      6 And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee,
      and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to
      whomsoever I will I give it.<BR />
      7 If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.<BR />
      8 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan:
      for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him
      only shalt thou serve.<BR />
      9 And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle
      of the temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God,
      cast thyself down from hence:<BR />
      10 For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee,
      to keep thee:<BR />
      11 And in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time
      thou dash thy foot against a stone.<BR />
      12 And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt
      not tempt the Lord thy God.<BR />
      13 And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed
      from him for a season.<BR />

      Acts 10:1-23</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion
      of the band called the Italian band,<BR />
      2 A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which
      gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God always.<BR />
      3 He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day
      an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.<BR />
      4 And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is
      it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are
      come up for a memorial before God.<BR />
      5 And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname
      is Peter:<BR />
      6 He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea
      side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.<BR />
      7 And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed,
      he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier
      of them that waited on him continually;<BR />
      8 And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent
      them to Joppa.<BR />
      9 On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh
      unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about
      the sixth hour:<BR />
      10 And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while
      they made ready, he fell into a trance,<BR />
      11 And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto
      him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and
      let down to the earth:<BR />
      12 Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth,
      and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.<BR />
      13 And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.<BR />
      14 But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing
      that is common or unclean.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor2338039"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">15 And
      the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath
      cleansed, that call not thou common.<BR />
      16 This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again
      into heaven.<BR />
      17 Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which
      he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from
      Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon's house, and stood before
      the gate,<BR />
      18 And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter,
      were lodged there.<BR />
      19 While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him,
      Behold, three men seek thee.<BR />
      20 Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting
      nothing: for I have sent them.<BR />
      21 Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from
      Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the
      cause wherefore ye are come?<BR />
      22 And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one
      that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of
      the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee
      into his house, and to hear words of thee.<BR />
      23 Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow
      Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied
      him.<BR />

      27 And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring
      thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that
      thou mayest curse me them from thence.<BR />
      28 And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh
      toward Jeshimon.<BR />
      29 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and
      prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.<BR />
      30 And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and
      a ram on every altar.<BR />
      1 And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel,
      he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but
      he set his face toward the wilderness.<BR />
      2 And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in
      his tents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came
      upon him.<BR />
      3 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor
      hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:<BR />
      4 He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision
      of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:<BR />
      5 How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel!<BR />
      6 As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's
      side, as the trees of lign aloes which the LORD hath planted,
      and as cedar trees beside the waters.<BR />
      7 He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall
      be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and
      his kingdom shall be exalted.<BR />
      8 God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the
      strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies,
      and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his
      arrows.<BR />
      9 He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who
      shall stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed
      is he that curseth thee.<BR />
      10 And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote
      his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee
      to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed
      them these three times.<BR />
      11 Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote
      thee unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back
      from honour.<BR />
      12 And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers
      which thou sentest unto me, saying,<BR />
      13 If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold,
      I cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do either
      good or bad of mine own mind; but what the LORD saith, that will
      I speak?<BR />
      25 And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and
      Balak also went his way.<BR />

      15 And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.<BR />
      16 And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and,
      as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath
      day, and stood up for to read.<BR />
      17 And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias.
      And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it
      was written,<BR />
      18 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed
      me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal
      the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and
      recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that
      are bruised,<BR />
      19 To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.<BR />
      20 And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister,
      and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue
      were fastened on him.<BR />
      21 And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture
      fulfilled in your ears.<BR />
      22 And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words
      which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this

      23 And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this proverb,
      Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum,
      do also here in thy country.<BR />

      26 But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a
      city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow.<BR />

      2 And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and
      all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea,<BR />
      3 And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the
      city of palm trees, unto Zoar.<BR />
      4 And the LORD said unto him, This is the land which I sware
      unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give
      it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes,
      but thou shalt not go over thither.<BR />
      5 So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of
      Moab, according to the word of the LORD.<BR />
      6 And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against
      Beth-peor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.<BR />
      7 And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died:
      his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.<BR />
      8 And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of
      Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses
      were ended.<BR />
      9 And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom;
      for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel
      hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses.<BR />
      10 And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses,
      whom the LORD knew face to face,<BR />
      11 In all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him
      to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants,
      and to all his land,<BR />
      12 And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which
      Moses showed in the sight of all Israel.<BR />

      31 And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught
      them on the sabbath days.<BR />
      32 And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was
      with power.<BR />
      33 And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of
      an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,<BR />
      34 Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus
      of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou
      art; the Holy One of God.<BR />
      35 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out
      of him. And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came
      out of him, and hurt him not.<BR />
      36 And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying,
      What a word is this! for with authority and power he commandeth
      the unclean spirits, and they come out.<BR />
      37 And the fame of him went out into every place of the country
      round about.<BR />
      38 And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's
      house. And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever;
      and they besought him for her.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor2358468"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">39 And
      he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and
      immediately she arose and ministered unto them.<BR />
      40 Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with
      divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands
      on every one of them, and healed them.<BR />
      41 And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying,
      Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered
      them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ.<BR />

      Lesson<BR />
      Zechariah 8:14-23</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      14 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you,
      when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the LORD of hosts,
      and I repented not:<BR />
      15 So again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem
      and to the house of Judah: fear ye not.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor2361976"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">16 These
      are the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the truth
      to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in
      your gates:<BR />
      17 And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his
      neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these are things that
      I hate, saith the LORD.<BR />
      18 And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me, saying,<BR />
      19 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The fast of the fourth month,
      and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the
      fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness,
      and cheerful feasts; therefore love the truth and peace.<BR />
      20 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; It shall yet come to pass, that
      there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities:<BR />
      21 And the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying,
      Let us go speedily to pray before the LORD, and to seek the LORD
      of hosts: I will go also.<BR />
      22 Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the
      LORD of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the LORD.<BR />
      23 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; In those days it shall come
      to pass, that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of
      the nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is
      a Jew, saying, We will go with you: for we have heard that God
      is with you.<BR />

      Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive
      that God is no respecter of persons:<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor2364279"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">35 But
      in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness,
      is accepted with him.<BR />
      36 The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching
      peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)<BR />
      37 That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout
      all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John
      preached;<BR />
      38 How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and
      with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were
      oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.<BR />
      39 And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the
      land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged
      on a tree:<BR />
      40 Him God raised up the third day, and showed him openly;<BR />
      41 Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of
      God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose
      from the dead.<BR />
      42 And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify
      that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick
      and dead.<BR />
      43 To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name
      whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.<BR />
      44 While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on
      all them which heard the word.<BR />
      45 And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished,
      as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also
      was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.<BR />
      46 For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then
      answered Peter,<BR />
      47 Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized,
      which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?<BR />
      48 And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord.
      Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.<BR />
