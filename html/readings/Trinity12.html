      11 Say not thou, It is through the Lord that I fell away: for
      thou oughtest not to do the things that he hateth.<BR />
      12 Say not thou, He hath caused me to err: for he hath no need
      of the sinful man.<BR />
      13 The Lord hateth all abomination; and they that fear God love
      it not.<BR />
      14 He himself made man from the beginning, and left him in the
      hand of his counsel;<BR />
      15 If thou wilt, to keep the commandments, and to perform acceptable
      faithfulness.<BR />
      16 He hath set fire and water before thee: stretch forth thy
      hand unto whether thou wilt.<BR />
      17 Before man is life and death; and whether him liketh shall
      be given him.<BR />
      18 For the wisdom of the Lord is great, and he is mighty in power,
      and beholdeth all things:<BR />
      19 And his eyes are upon them that fear him, and he knoweth every
      work of man.<BR />
      20 He hath commanded no man to do wickedly, neither hath he given
      any man licence to sin.<BR />

      1 Blessed be God that liveth for ever, and blessed be his kingdom.<BR />
      2 For he doth scourge, and hath mercy: he leadeth down to hell,
      and bringeth up again: neither is there any that can avoid his
      hand.<BR />
      3 Confess him before the Gentiles, ye children of Israel: for
      he hath scattered us among them.<BR />
      4 There declare his greatness, and extol him before all the living:
      for he is our Lord, and he is the God our Father for ever.<BR />
      5 And he will scourge us for our iniquities, and will have mercy
      again, and will gather us out of all nations, among whom he hath
      scattered us.<BR />
      7 I will extol my God, and my soul shall praise the King of heaven,
      and shall rejoice in his greatness.<BR />
      8 Let all men speak, and let all praise him for his righteousness.<BR />
      9 O Jerusalem, the holy city, he will scourge thee for thy children's
      works, and will have mercy again on the sons of the righteous.<BR />
      10 Give praise to the Lord, for he is good: and praise the everlasting
      King, that his tabernacle may be builded in thee again with joy,
      and let him make joyful there in thee those that are captives,
      and love in thee for ever those that are miserable.<BR />
      11 Many nations shall come from far to the name of the Lord God
      with gifts in their hands, even gifts to the King of heaven;
      all generations shall praise thee with great joy.<BR />

      I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.<BR />
      20 Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ

      12 And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed
      the house of Obed-edom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because
      of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God
      from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with gladness.<BR />
      13 And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD
      had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.<BR />
      14 And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David
      was girded with a linen ephod.<BR />
      15 So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of
      the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.<BR />
      17 And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his
      place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched
      for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings
      before the LORD.<BR />
      18 And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings
      and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the
      LORD of hosts.<BR />
      19 And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude
      of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of
      bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all
      the people departed every one to his house.<BR />

      13 And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests
      and the rulers and the people,<BR />
      14 Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that
      perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before
      you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof
      ye accuse him:<BR />
      15 No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing
      worthy of death is done unto him.<BR />
      16 I will therefore chastise him, and release him.<BR />
      17 (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)<BR />
      18 And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man,
      and release unto us Barabbas:<BR />
      19 (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder,
      was cast into prison.)<BR />
      20 Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to
      them.<BR />
      21 But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.<BR />
      22 And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath
      he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore
      chastise him, and let him go.<BR />
      23 And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he
      might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests
      prevailed.<BR />
      24 And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.<BR />
      25 And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder
      was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered
      Jesus to their will.<BR />

      2 I will utterly consume all things from off the land, saith

      14 The great day of the LORD is near, it is near, and hasteth
      greatly, even the voice of the day of the LORD: the mighty man
      shall cry there bitterly.<BR />
      15 That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress,
      a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess,
      a day of clouds and thick darkness,<BR />
      16 A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities,
      and against the high towers.<BR />
      17 And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like
      blind men, because they have sinned against the LORD: and their
      blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung.<BR />
      18 Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver

      1 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that
      ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto
      God, which is your reasonable service.<BR />
      2 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by
      the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good,
      and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.<BR />
      3 For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that
      is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought
      to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to
      every man the measure of faith.<BR />
      4 For as we have many members in one body, and all members have
      not the same office:<BR />
      5 So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members
      one of another.<BR />
      6 Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is
      given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the
      proportion of faith;<BR />
      7 Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth,
      on teaching;<BR />
      8 Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him
      do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that
      showeth mercy, with cheerfulness.<BR />
      9 Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil;
      cleave to that which is good.<BR />
      10 Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love;
      in honour preferring one another;<BR />
      11 Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;<BR />
      12 Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant
      in prayer;<BR />
      13 Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.<BR />
      14 Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.<BR />
      15 Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that
      weep.<BR />
      16 Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things,
      but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own
      conceits.<BR />
      17 Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest
      in the sight of all men.<BR />
      18 If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably
      with all men.<BR />
      19 Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place
      unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay,
      saith the Lord.<BR />
      20 Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give
      him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his
      head.<BR />
      21 Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.<BR />

      1 And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the
      LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;<BR />
      2 That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell
      in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.<BR />
      3 And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart;
      for the LORD is with thee.<BR />
      4 And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came
      unto Nathan, saying,<BR />
      5 Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou
      build me an house for me to dwell in?<BR />
      6 Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I
      brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this
      day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.<BR />
      7 In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children
      of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom
      I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not
      me an house of cedar?<BR />
      8 Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus
      saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from
      following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:<BR />
      9 And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut
      off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a
      great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in the
      earth.<BR />
      10 Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and
      will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own,
      and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict
      them any more, as beforetime,<BR />
      11 And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my
      people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies.
      Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house.<BR />
      16 And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever
      before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.<BR />
      17 According to all these words, and according to all this vision,
      so did Nathan speak unto David.<BR />

      27 And there followed him a great company of people, and of women,
      which also bewailed and lamented him.<BR />
      28 But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem,
      weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.<BR />
      29 For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall
      say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and

      1 Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!<BR />
      2 She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she
      trusted not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God.<BR />
      3 Her princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening
      wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.<BR />
      4 Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests
      have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.<BR />
      5 The just LORD is in the midst thereof; he will not do iniquity:
      every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth
      not; but the unjust knoweth no shame.<BR />
      6 I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made
      their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed,
      so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant.<BR />
      7 I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction;
      so their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished
      them: but they rose early, and corrupted all their doings.<BR />
      8 Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that
      I rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the
      nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them
      mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth
      shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.<BR />

      1 Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there
      is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.<BR />
      2 Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance
      of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.<BR />
      3 For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil.
      Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good,
      and thou shalt have praise of the same:<BR />
      4 For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou
      do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword
      in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute
      wrath upon him that doeth evil.<BR />
      5 Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but
      also for conscience sake.<BR />
      6 For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's
      ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.<BR />
      7 Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute
      is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom
      honour.<BR />
      8 Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that
      loveth another hath fulfilled the law.<BR />
      9 For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill,
      Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou
      shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is
      briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love
      thy neighbour as thyself.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor227963"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">10 Love
      worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling
      of the law.<BR />
      11 And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake
      out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.<BR />
      12 The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore
      cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour
      of light.<BR />
      13 Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness,
      not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.<BR />
      14 But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision

      Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said,
      Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast brought
      me hitherto?<BR />
      19 And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but
      thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while
      to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?<BR />
      20 And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD,
      knowest thy servant.<BR />
      21 For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast
      thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know them.<BR />
      22 Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like
      thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all
      that we have heard with our ears.<BR />
      23 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even
      like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself,
      and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible,
      for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee
      from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?<BR />
      24 For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be
      a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their
      God.<BR />
      25 And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning
      thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever,
      and do as thou hast said.<BR />
      26 And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of
      hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant
      David be established before thee.<BR />
      27 For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to
      thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath
      thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.<BR />
      28 And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true,
      and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:<BR />
      29 Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy
      servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou,
      O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house
      of thy servant be blessed for ever.<BR />

      9 For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they

      10 From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the

      away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride,
      and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain.<BR />
      12 I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor
      people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD.<BR />
      13 The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies;
      neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for
      they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.<BR />
      14 Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice
      with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.<BR />
      15 The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine

      thee: thou shalt not see evil any more.<BR />

      17 The LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save,
      he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love,

      18 I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly,

      19 Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and
      I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven
      out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where
      they have been put to shame.<BR />
      20 At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that

      2 For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who

      3 Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let

      4 Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own

      6 He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and

      2 And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was
      Ziba. And when they had called him unto David, the king said
      unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he.<BR />
      3 And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul,
      that I may show the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto
      the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his feet.<BR />
      4 And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto
      the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel,
      in Lo-debar.<BR />
      5 Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir,
      the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar.<BR />
      6 Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul,
      was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence.

      kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee
      all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at

      him, I have given unto thy master's son all that pertained to
      Saul and to all his house.<BR />

      not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ
      died.<BR />
      16 Let not then your good be evil spoken of:<BR />
      17 For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness,
      and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.<BR />
      18 For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to
      God, and approved of men.<BR />
      19 Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace,
      and things wherewith one may edify another.<BR />
      20 For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are
      pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.<BR />
      21 It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any
      thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made
      weak.<BR />
      22 Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he
      that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.<BR />
      23 And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth
      not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.<BR />

      2 Samuel 11:1-13</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time
      when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his
      servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children
      of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem.<BR />
      2 And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from
      off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and
      from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was
      very beautiful to look upon.<BR />
      3 And David sent and inquired after the woman. And one said,
      Is not this Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah
      the Hittite?<BR />
      4 And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto
      him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness:
      and she returned unto her house.<BR />
      5 And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said,
      I am with child.<BR />
      6 And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite.
      And Joab sent Uriah to David.<BR />
      7 And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how
      Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.<BR />
      8 And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy
      feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed
      him a mess of meat from the king.<BR />
      9 But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the
      servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.<BR />
      10 And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down
      unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy
      journey? why then didst thou not go down unto thine house?<BR />
      11 And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah,
      abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord,
      are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house,
      to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest,
      and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.<BR />
      12 And David said to Uriah, Tarry here today also, and tomorrow
      I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day,
      and the morrow.<BR />
      13 And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before
      him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on
      his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his
      house.<BR />

      13 And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called
      Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.<BR />
      14 And they talked together of all these things which had happened.<BR />
      15 And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and
      reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.<BR />
      16 But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.<BR />
      17 And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these
      that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?<BR />
      18 And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said
      unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not
      known the things which are come to pass there in these days?<BR />
      19 And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him,
      Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed
      and word before God and all the people:<BR />
      20 And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to
      be condemned to death, and have crucified him.<BR />
      21 But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed
      Israel: and beside all this, today is the third day since these
      things were done.<BR />
      22 Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished,
      which were early at the sepulchre;<BR />
      23 And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that
      they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was
      alive.<BR />
      24 And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre,
      and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw
      not.<BR />
      25 Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe
      all that the prophets have spoken:<BR />
      26 Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter
      into his glory?<BR />
      27 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded
      unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.<BR />
      28 And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and
      he made as though he would have gone further.<BR />
      29 But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is
      toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry
      with them.<BR />
      30 And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took
      bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.<BR />
      31 And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished
      out of their sight.<BR />
      32 And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within
      us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to
      us the scriptures?<BR />
      33 And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem,
      and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with
      them,<BR />
      34 Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.<BR />
      35 And they told what things were done in the way, and how he
      was known of them in breaking of bread.<BR />

      11 The fear of the Lord is honour, and glory, and gladness, and
      a crown of rejoicing.<BR />
      12 The fear of the Lord maketh a merry heart, and giveth joy,
      and gladness, and a long life.<BR />
      13 Whoso feareth the Lord, it shall go well with him at the last,
      and he shall find favour in the day of his death.<BR />
      14 To fear the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and it was created
      with the faithful in the womb.<BR />
      15 She hath built an everlasting foundation with men, and she
      shall continue with their seed.<BR />
      16 To fear the Lord is fulness of wisdom, and filleth men with
      her fruits.<BR />
      17 She filleth all their house with things desirable, and the
      garners with her increase.<BR />
      18 The fear of the Lord is a crown of wisdom, making peace and
      perfect health to flourish; both which are the gifts of God:
      and it enlargeth their rejoicing that love him.<BR />
      19 Wisdom raineth down skill and knowledge of understanding,
      and exalteth them to honour that hold her fast.<BR />
      20 The root of wisdom is to fear the Lord, and the branches thereof
      are long life.<BR />
      26 If thou desire wisdom, keep the commandments, and the Lord
      shall give her unto thee.<BR />
      27 For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and instruction: and faith
      and meekness are his delight.<BR />

      2 Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification.<BR />
      3 For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written,

      14 And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter
      to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.<BR />
      15 And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront
      of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be
      smitten, and die.<BR />
      16 And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he
      assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were.<BR />
      17 And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and
      there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah
      the Hittite died also.<BR />
      18 Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the
      war;<BR />
      19 And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an
      end of telling the matters of the war unto the king,<BR />
      20 And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto
      thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did
      fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?<BR />
      21 Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman
      cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died
      in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant
      Uriah the Hittite is dead also.<BR />
      22 So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that
      Joab had sent him for.<BR />
      23 And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed
      against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were
      upon them even unto the entering of the gate.<BR />
      24 And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants;
      and some of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah
      the Hittite is dead also.<BR />
      25 Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto
      Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth
      one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the
      city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.<BR />
      26 And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was
      dead, she mourned for her husband.<BR />
      27 And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her
      to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But
      the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.<BR />

      37 But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that

      39 Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me,
      and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me
      have.<BR />
      40 And when he had thus spoken, he showed them his hands and
      his feet.<BR />
      41 And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he
      said unto them, Have ye here any meat?<BR />
      42 And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.<BR />
      43 And he took it, and did eat before them.<BR />

      which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets,
      and in the psalms, concerning me.<BR />
      45 Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand

      46 And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved
      Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:<BR />
      47 And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached
      in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.<BR />

      26 For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a
      certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.<BR />
      27 It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For
      if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things,
      their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.<BR />
      28 When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them
      this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.<BR />
      29 And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in
      the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.<BR />

      I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and
      for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in
      your prayers to God for me;<BR />
      31 That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea;
      and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted
      of the saints;<BR />
      32 That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and
      may with you be refreshed.<BR />
      33 Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.<BR />
