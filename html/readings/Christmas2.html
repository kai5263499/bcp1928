      Micah 4:1-5,5:2-4</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain
      of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the
      mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people
      shall flow unto it.<BR />
      2 And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up
      to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob;
      and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths:
      for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD
      from Jerusalem.<BR />
      3 And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations
      afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and
      their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword
      against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.<BR />
      4 But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig
      tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the LORD
      of hosts hath spoken it.<BR />
      5 For all people will walk every one in the name of his god,
      and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and
      ever.<BR />
      2 But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the
      thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto
      me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been
      from of old, from everlasting.<BR />
      3 Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she which
      travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren
      shall return unto the children of Israel.<BR />
      4 And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD, in
      the majesty of the name of the LORD his God; and they shall abide:
      for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.<BR />

      21 And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising
      of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of
      the angel before he was conceived in the womb.<BR />
      22 And when the days of her purification according to the law
      of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to
      present him to the Lord;<BR />
      23 (As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that
      openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)<BR />
      24 And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in
      the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.<BR />
      25 And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was
      Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the
      consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.<BR />
      26 And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should
      not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.<BR />

      29 Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according
      to thy word:<BR />
      30 For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,<BR />

      1 Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received

      2 But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking
      in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but
      by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's
      conscience in the sight of God.<BR />
      3 But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:<BR />
      4 In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them

      I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, and the praises
      of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on
      us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which
      he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according
      to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.<BR />
      8 For he said, Surely they are my people, children that will
      not lie: so he was their Saviour.<BR />
      9 In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of
      his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed
      them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.<BR />
      10 But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he
      was turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them.<BR />
      11 Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people,
      saying, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with
      the shepherd of his flock? where is he that put his holy Spirit
      within him?<BR />
      12 That led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious
      arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting
      name?<BR />

      1 Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us,
      that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world
      knoweth us not, because it knew him not.<BR />
      2 Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear
      what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we
      shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.<BR />
      3 And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself,
      even as he is pure.<BR />
      4 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin
      is the transgression of the law.<BR />
      5 And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and
      in him is no sin.<BR />
      6 Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath

      children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness
      is righteous, even as he is righteous.<BR />
      8 He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth
      from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested,
      that he might destroy the works of the devil.<BR />
      9 Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed
      remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.<BR />
      10 In this the children of God are manifest, and the children
      of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God,
      neither he that loveth not his brother.<BR />
      11 For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning,
      that we should love one another.<BR />

      they restrained?<BR />
      16 Doubtless thou art our father, though Abraham be ignorant

      our redeemer; thy name is from everlasting.<BR />
      17 O LORD, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, and hardened
      our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants' sake, the tribes
      of thine inheritance.<BR />
      18 The people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little

      1 Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering
      into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.<BR />
      2 For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them:
      but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with
      faith in them that heard it.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor507761"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">3 For
      we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have
      sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although
      the works were finished from the foundation of the world.<BR />
      4 For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this
      wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.<BR />
      5 And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.<BR />
      6 Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein,
      and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because
      of unbelief:<BR />
      7 Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day,
      after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his
      voice, harden not your hearts.<BR />
      8 For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward
      have spoken of another day.<BR />
      9 There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.<BR />
      10 For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased
      from his own works, as God did from his.<BR />

      Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed
      into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our
      profession.<BR />
      15 For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with
      the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted
      like as we are, yet without sin.<BR />
      16 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that
      we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.<BR />
      1 For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for
      men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts
      and sacrifices for sins:<BR />
      2 Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are
      out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.<BR />
      3 And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for
      himself, to offer for sins.<BR />
      4 And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is
      called of God, as was Aaron.<BR />
      5 So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest;
      but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten
      thee.<BR />
      6 As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever
      after the order of Melchisedec.<BR />
      7 Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers
      and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that
      was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;<BR />

      he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he

      unto all them that obey him;<BR />
      10 Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.<BR />

      13 For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of

      Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether
      they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into

      their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not;<BR />
      16 John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you
      with water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose
      shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the
      Holy Ghost and with fire:<BR />
      17 Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his
      floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff
      he will burn with fire unquenchable.<BR />
      18 And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto
      the people.<BR />
      19 But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias
      his brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod
      had done,<BR />
      20 Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison.<BR />
      21 Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that
      Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,<BR />
      22 And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove
      upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art
      my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.<BR />

      9 And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that
      they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son

      12 And he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh first,

      1 Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for

      13 At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above
      the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which
      journeyed with me.<BR />
      14 And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice
      speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul,
      why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against
      the pricks.<BR />
      15 And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom
      thou persecutest.<BR />
      16 But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto
      thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness
      both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things
      in the which I will appear unto thee;<BR />
      17 Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto
      whom now I send thee,<BR />
      18 To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light,
      and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness
      of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith
      that is in me.<BR />
      19 Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the
      heavenly vision:<BR />
      20 But showed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem,
      and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles,
      that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for
      repentance.<BR />
      21 For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went
      about to kill me.<BR />
      22 Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this
      day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things
      than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:<BR />
      23 That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first
      that should rise from the dead, and should show light unto the
      people, and to the Gentiles.<BR />

      Jonah 4 </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.<BR />
      2 And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD,
      was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore
      I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious
      God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and
      repentest thee of the evil.<BR />
      3 Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me;
      for it is better for me to die than to live.<BR />
      4 Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?<BR />
      5 So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of
      the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the
      shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.<BR />
      6 And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over
      Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him
      from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.<BR />
      7 But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day,
      and it smote the gourd that it withered.<BR />
      8 And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared
      a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah,
      that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is
      better for me to die than to live.<BR />
      9 And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the
      gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.<BR />
      10 Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the
      which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came
      up in a night, and perished in a night:<BR />
      11 And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are
      more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between
      their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?<BR />

      13 For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle
      of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:<BR />
      14 If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are
      my flesh, and might save some of them.<BR />
      15 For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the

      dead?<BR />
      16 For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and
      if the root be holy, so are the branches.<BR />
      17 And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being
      a wild olive tree, wert grafted in among them, and with them

      because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by

      21 For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest
      he also spare not thee.<BR />
      22 Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them
      which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue
      in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.<BR />
      23 And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall
      be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.<BR />
      24 For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by
      nature, and wert grafted contrary to nature into a good olive
      tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches,
