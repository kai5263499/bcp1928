      The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they
      that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath
      the light shined.<BR />
      3 Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy:
      they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as
      men rejoice when they divide the spoil.<BR />
      4 For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff
      of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian.<BR />
      5 For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and
      garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and
      fuel of fire.<BR />
      6 For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the
      government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be
      called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting
      Father, The Prince of Peace.<BR />
      7 Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be
      no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order
      it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth
      even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this.<BR />

      1 And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree
      from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.<BR />
      2 (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor
      of Syria.)<BR />
      3 And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.<BR />
      4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth,
      into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem;
      (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)<BR />
      5 To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.<BR />
      6 And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished
      that she should be delivered.<BR />
      7 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in
      swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was
      no room for them in the inn.<BR />
      8 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the
      field, keeping watch over their flock by night.<BR />
      9 And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory
      of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.<BR />
      10 And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring
      you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.<BR />
      11 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour,
      which is Christ the Lord.<BR />
      12 And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe
      wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.<BR />
      13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly
      host praising God, and saying,<BR />
      14 Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will
      toward men.<BR />
      15 And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them
      into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go
      even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass,
      which the Lord hath made known unto us.<BR />
      16 And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and
      the babe lying in a manger.<BR />
      17 And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying
      which was told them concerning this child.<BR />
      18 And all they that heard it wondered at those things which
      were told them by the shepherds.<BR />
      19 But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.<BR />
      20 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for
      all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto
      them.<BR />

      7 I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, and the praises
      of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on
      us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which
      he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according
      to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.<BR />
      8 For he said, Surely they are my people, children that will
      not lie: so he was their Saviour.<BR />
      9 In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of
      his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed
      them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.<BR />
      10 But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he
      was turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor120737"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">11 Then
      he remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people, saying,
      Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd
      of his flock? where is he that put his holy Spirit within him?<BR />
      12 That led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious
      arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting
      name?<BR />
      13 That led them through the deep, as an horse in the wilderness,
      that they should not stumble?<BR />
      14 As a beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of the LORD
      caused him to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself
      a glorious name.<BR />
      15 Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy
      holiness and of thy glory: where is thy zeal and thy strength,
      the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are
      they restrained?<BR />
      16 Doubtless thou art our father, though Abraham be ignorant
      of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O LORD, art our father,
      our redeemer; thy name is from everlasting.<BR />

      1 Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them

      of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:<BR />
      2 Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge
      of God, and of Jesus our Lord,<BR />
      3 According as his divine power hath given unto us all things
      that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of

      4 Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises:

      7 And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness

      1 Thus saith the LORD, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for
      my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.<BR />
      2 Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that
      layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it,
      and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.<BR />
      3 Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself
      to the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD hath utterly separated me
      from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry
      tree.<BR />
      4 For thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths,
      and choose the things that please me, and take hold of my covenant;<BR />
      5 Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls
      a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will
      give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.<BR />
      6 Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the
      LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his
      servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it,
      and taketh hold of my covenant;<BR />
      7 Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful
      in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices
      shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be called
      an house of prayer for all people.<BR />

      unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.<BR />

      we lie, and do not the truth:<BR />
      7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have
      fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his

      2 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he
      hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;<BR />
      3 Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image

      my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to
      him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?<BR />
      6 And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world,
      he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.<BR />
      7 And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits,
      and his ministers a flame of fire.<BR />
      8 But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and
      ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.<BR />
      9 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore
      God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness

      no judgment.<BR />
      16 And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there
      was no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto
      him; and his righteousness, it sustained him.<BR />

      1 Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things
      which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor70238"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">2 For
      if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression
      and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;<BR />
      3 How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which
      at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed
      unto us by them that heard him;<BR />
      4 God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders,
      and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according
      to his own will?<BR />
      5 For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world
      to come, whereof we speak.<BR />
      6 But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man,
      that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest
      him?<BR />
      7 Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst
      him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of
      thy hands:<BR />
      8 Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For
      in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that
      is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under
      him.<BR />
      9 But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels
      for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that
      he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.<BR />
      10 For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are
      all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain
      of their salvation perfect through sufferings.<BR />
      11 For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are
      all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,<BR />
      12 Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst
      of the church will I sing praise unto thee.<BR />
      13 And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I
      and the children which God hath given me.<BR />
      14 Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and
      blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through
      death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that
      is, the devil;<BR />

      deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime
      subject to bondage.<BR />
      16 For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he
      took on him the seed of Abraham.<BR />
      17 Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto
      his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest
      in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins
      of the people.<BR />
      18 For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is
      able to succour them that are tempted.<BR />

      13 But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest
      any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.<BR />

      14 For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken
      down the middle wall of partition between us;<BR />
      15 Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of
      commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself
      of twain one new man, so making peace;<BR />
      16 And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the
      cross, having slain the enmity thereby:<BR />
      17 And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and
      to them that were nigh.<BR />
      18 For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the
      Father.<BR />
      19 Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but
      fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;<BR />
      20 And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets,
      Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;<BR />
      21 In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto
      an holy temple in the Lord:<BR />
      22 In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of
      God through the Spirit.<BR />

      11 For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is
      not hidden from thee, neither is it far off.<BR />
      12 It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go
      up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it,
      and do it?<BR />
      13 Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who
      shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may
      hear it, and do it?<BR />
      14 But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in
      thy heart, that thou mayest do it.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor101744"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">15 See,
      I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and
      evil;<BR />
      16 In that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God,
      to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes
      and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and the
      LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest
      to possess it.<BR />
      17 But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear,
      but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;<BR />
      18 I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish,
      and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither
      thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it.<BR />
      19 I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that
      I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore
      choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:<BR />
      20 That thou mayest love the LORD thy God, and that thou mayest
      obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he
      is thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest dwell
      in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham,
      to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.<BR />

      And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that
      sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness
      he doth judge and make war.<BR />
      12 His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many
      crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.<BR />
      13 And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his
      name is called The Word of God.<BR />

      the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses,
      clothed in fine linen, white and clean.<BR />
      15 And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he
      should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of
      iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath
      of Almighty God.<BR />
      16 And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written,
      KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.<BR />
