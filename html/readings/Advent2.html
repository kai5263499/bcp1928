      1 Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful
      garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall
      no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.<BR />
      2 Shake thyself from the dust; arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem:
      loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter
      of Zion.<BR />
      3 For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for nought;
      and ye shall be redeemed without money.<BR />
      4 For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down aforetime
      into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them
      without cause.<BR />
      5 Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my people
      is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them
      to howl, saith the LORD; and my name continually every day is
      blasphemed.<BR />
      6 Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore they shall
      know in that day that I am he that doth speak: behold, it is
      I.<BR />

      beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth
      good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings
      of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy
      God reigneth!<BR />
      8 Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together
      shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the LORD
      shall bring again Zion.<BR />
      9 Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem:
      for the LORD hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.<BR />
      10 The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the
      nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation
      of our God.<BR />

      Luke 1:26-56</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      26 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God
      unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,<BR />
      27 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the
      house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.<BR />
      28 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that
      art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou
      among women.<BR />
      29 And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and
      cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.<BR />
      30 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast
      found favour with God.<BR />
      31 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth
      a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.<BR />
      32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest:
      and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father
      David:<BR />
      33 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of
      his kingdom there shall be no end.<BR />
      34 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I
      know not a man?<BR />
      35 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall
      come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow
      thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee
      shall be called the Son of God.<BR />
      36 And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived
      a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who
      was called barren.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor44837"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">37 For
      with God nothing shall be impossible.<BR />
      38 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto
      me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.<BR />
      39 And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country
      with haste, into a city of Juda;<BR />
      40 And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.<BR />
      41 And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation
      of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled
      with the Holy Ghost:<BR />
      42 And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art
      thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.<BR />
      43 And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should
      come to me?<BR />
      44 For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in
      mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.<BR />
      45 And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance
      of those things which were told her from the Lord.<BR />
      46 And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,<BR />
      47 And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.<BR />
      48 For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for,
      behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.<BR />
      49 For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy
      is his name.<BR />
      50 And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to
      generation.<BR />
      51 He hath showed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the
      proud in the imagination of their hearts.<BR />
      52 He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted
      them of low degree.<BR />
      53 He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he
      hath sent empty away.<BR />
      54 He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;<BR />
      55 As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for
      ever.<BR />
      56 And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to
      her own house.<BR />

      1 For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that
      it was not in vain:<BR />
      2 But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully
      entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to
      speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.<BR />
      3 For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness,
      nor in guile:<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor64290"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">4 But
      as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel,
      even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth
      our hearts.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor65275"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">5 For
      neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor
      a cloak of covetousness; God is witness:<BR />
      6 Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others,
      when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.<BR />
      7 But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her
      children:<BR />
      8 So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to
      have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also
      our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.<BR />
      9 For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring
      night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of
      you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.<BR />
      10 Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and
      unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:<BR />
      11 As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every
      one of you, as a father doth his children,<BR />
      12 That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto
      his kingdom and glory.<BR />
      13 For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because,
      when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received
      it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of
      God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.<BR />

      5 The LORD spake also unto me again, saying,<BR />
      6 Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that
      go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;<BR />
      7 Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters

      go over all his banks:<BR />
      8 And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over,
      he shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of his
      wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.<BR />
      11 For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed
      me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,<BR />

      shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be

      23 And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields
      on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to
      pluck the ears of corn.<BR />
      24 And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the
      sabbath day that which is not lawful?<BR />
      25 And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did,
      when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were
      with him?<BR />
      26 How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar
      the high priest, and did eat the showbread, which is not lawful
      to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were
      with him?<BR />

      man for the sabbath:<BR />

      1 And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man
      there which had a withered hand.<BR />

      6 Howl ye; for the day of the LORD is at hand; it shall come
      as a destruction from the Almighty.<BR />
      7 Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart shall
      melt:<BR />
      8 And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold
      of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they
      shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as flames.<BR />
      9 Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and
      fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy
      the sinners thereof out of it.<BR />
      10 For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall
      not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going
      forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.<BR />
      11 And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked
      for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud
      to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.<BR />
      12 I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man
      than the golden wedge of Ophir.<BR />
      13 Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove
      out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in the
      day of his fierce anger.<BR />
      14 And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no
      man taketh up: they shall every man turn to his own people, and
      flee every one into his own land.<BR />
      15 Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every
      one that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword.<BR />

      1 And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and
      with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's

      2 And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters,
      and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of

      3 And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and
      before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn
      that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which
      were redeemed from the earth.<BR />
      4 These are they which were not defiled with women; for they

      8 And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen,
      is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink
      of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.<BR />

      in his forehead, or in his hand,<BR />
      10 The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which
