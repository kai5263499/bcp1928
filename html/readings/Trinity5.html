      My son, if thou come to serve the Lord, prepare thy soul for
      temptation.<BR />
      2 Set thy heart aright, and constantly endure, and make not haste
      in time of trouble.<BR />
      3 Cleave unto him, and depart not away, that thou mayest be increased

      6 Believe in him, and he will help thee; order thy way aright,

      7 Ye that fear the Lord, wait for his mercy; and go not aside,
      lest ye fall.<BR />

      Matthew 19:16-30</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      16 And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what
      good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?<BR />
      17 And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none
      good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life,
      keep the commandments.<BR />
      18 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder,
      Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt
      not bear false witness,<BR />
      19 Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy
      neighbour as thyself.<BR />
      20 The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept
      from my youth up: what lack I yet?<BR />
      21 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell
      that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure
      in heaven: and come and follow me.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor608796"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">22 But
      when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful:
      for he had great possessions.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor610027"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">23 Then
      said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a
      rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.<BR />
      24 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through
      the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom
      of God.<BR />
      25 When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed,
      saying, Who then can be saved?<BR />
      26 But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is
      impossible; but with God all things are possible.<BR />
      27 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken
      all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?<BR />
      28 And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which
      have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall
      sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve
      thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.<BR />
      29 And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters,
      or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my
      name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit
      everlasting life.<BR />
      30 But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall
      be first.<BR />

      26 If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother,

      to finish it?<BR />
      29 Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not
      able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,<BR />
      30 Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.<BR />
      31 Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth
      not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand

      32 Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth

      Ruth 2:1-13 </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth,
      of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.<BR />
      2 And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the
      field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall
      find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.<BR />
      3 And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the
      reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging
      unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.<BR />
      4 And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers,
      The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless thee.<BR />
      5 Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers,
      Whose damsel is this?<BR />
      6 And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and
      said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out
      of the country of Moab:<BR />
      7 And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the
      reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even
      from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the
      house.<BR />
      8 Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go
      not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide
      here fast by my maidens:<BR />
      9 Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou
      after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall
      not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels,
      and drink of that which the young men have drawn.<BR />
      10 Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,
      and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that
      thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?<BR />
      11 And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shown
      me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the
      death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and
      thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a
      people which thou knewest not heretofore.<BR />
      12 The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee
      of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to
      trust.<BR />
      13 Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for
      that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly
      unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.<BR />

      46 Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should
      be greatest.<BR />
      47 And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child,
      and set him by him,<BR />
      48 And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in
      my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth
      him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same
      shall be great.<BR />
      49 And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out
      devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not
      with us.<BR />
      50 And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not
      against us is for us.<BR />
      51 And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should
      be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,<BR />
      52 And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered
      into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.<BR />
      53 And they did not receive him, because his face was as though
      he would go to Jerusalem.<BR />
      54 And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said,
      Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven,
      and consume them, even as Elias did?<BR />
      55 But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what
      manner of spirit ye are of.<BR />
      56 For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but
      to save them. And they went to another village.<BR />
      57 And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain
      man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou
      goest.<BR />
      58 And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the
      air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his
      head.<BR />
      59 And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer
      me first to go and bury my father.<BR />
      60 Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go
      thou and preach the kingdom of God.<BR />
      61 And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me
      first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.<BR />

      2 And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately
      come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius
      had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.<BR />
      3 And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and
      wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.<BR />

      the Jews and the Greeks.<BR />
      5 And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul
      was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus
      was Christ.<BR />
      6 And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook
      his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own
      heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.<BR />
      7 And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house,
      named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard
      to the synagogue.<BR />

      eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she
      sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and
      she did eat, and was sufficed, and left.<BR />
      15 And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young
      men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach
      her not:<BR />
      16 And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her,
      and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.<BR />
      17 So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that
      she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.<BR />
      18 And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother-in-law
      saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to
      her that she had reserved after she was sufficed.<BR />
      19 And her mother-in-law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned
      today? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take
      knowledge of thee. And she showed her mother-in-law with whom
      she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought
      today is Boaz.<BR />
      20 And Naomi said unto her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of
      the LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and
      to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin
      unto us, one of our next kinsmen.<BR />
      21 And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt

      23 So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the

      sent them two and two before his face into every city and place,
      whither he himself would come.<BR />
      2 Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but
      the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest,
      that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.<BR />
      3 Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.<BR />
      4 Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man
      by the way.<BR />
      5 And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to
      this house.<BR />
      6 And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon
      it: if not, it shall turn to you again.<BR />
      7 And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things
      as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not
      from house to house.<BR />
      8 And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat
      such things as are set before you:<BR />
      9 And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The
      kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor51102"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">10 But
      into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your
      ways out into the streets of the same, and say,<BR />
      11 Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we
      do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this,
      that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.<BR />
      12 But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that
      day for Sodom, than for that city.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor52252"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">13 Woe
      unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty
      works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in
      you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth
      and ashes.<BR />
      14 But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment,
      than for you.<BR />
      15 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be
      thrust down to hell.<BR />
      16 He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you
      despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent
      me.<BR />
      17 And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even
      the devils are subject unto us through thy name.<BR />
      18 And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from
      heaven.<BR />
      19 Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions,
      and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any
      means hurt you.<BR />
      20 Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are
      subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are
      written in heaven.<BR />
      21 In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee,
      O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these
      things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto
      babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.<BR />
      22 All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth
      who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the
      Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.<BR />
      23 And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately,
      Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see:<BR />
      24 For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired
      to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and
      to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.<BR />

      42 Now when Judas and his brethren saw that miseries were multiplied,
      and that the forces did encamp themselves in their borders: for
      they knew how the king had given commandment to destroy the people,
      and utterly abolish them;<BR />
      43 They said one to another, Let us restore the decayed fortune
      of our people, and let us fight for our people and the sanctuary.<BR />
      44 Then was the congregation gathered together, that they might
      be ready for battle, and that they might pray, and ask mercy
      and compassion.<BR />
      45 Now Jerusalem lay void as a wilderness, there was none of
      her children that went in or out: the sanctuary also was trodden
      down, and aliens kept the strong hold; the heathen had their
      habitation in that place; and joy was taken from Jacob, and the
      pipe with the harp ceased.<BR />
      46 Wherefore the Israelites assembled themselves together, and
      came to Maspha, over against Jerusalem; for in Maspha was the
      place where they prayed aforetime in Israel.<BR />
      47 Then they fasted that day, and put on sackcloth, and cast
      ashes upon their heads, and rent their clothes,<BR />
      48 And laid open the book of the law, wherein the heathen had
      sought to paint the likeness of their images.<BR />
      49 They brought also the priests' garments, and the firstfruits,
      and the tithes: and the Nazarites they stirred up, who had<BR />
      accomplished their days.<BR />
      50 Then cried they with a loud voice toward heaven, saying, What
      shall we do with these, and whither shall we carry them away?<BR />

      12 And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection
      with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment
      seat,<BR />
      13 Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary
      to the law.<BR />
      14 And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said
      unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness,
      O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor64599"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">15 But

      17 Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the
      synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio
      cared for none of those things.<BR />
      18 And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then
      took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria,
      and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea:
      for he had a vow.<BR />
      19 And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself
      entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.<BR />
      20 When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented
      not;<BR />
      21 But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this
      feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto
      you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.<BR />
      22 And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted
      the church, he went down to Antioch.<BR />
      23 And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went

      he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came
      softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.<BR />
      8 And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and

      10 And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for

      26 He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest
      thou?<BR />
      27 And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with

      28 And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and

      29 But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who
      is my neighbour?<BR />
      30 And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem
      to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his
      raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.<BR />
      31 And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and
      when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.<BR />
      32 And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and

      wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn,

      37 Upon this all the host assembled themselves together, and
      went up into mount Sion.<BR />

      41 Then Judas appointed certain men to fight against those that

      42 So he chose priests of blameless conversation, such as had
      pleasure in the law:<BR />
      43 Who cleansed the sanctuary, and bare out the defiled stones
      into an unclean place.<BR />
      44 And when as they consulted what to do with the altar of burnt

      45 They thought it best to pull it down, lest it should be a

      they pulled it down,<BR />
      46 And laid up the stones in the mountain of the temple in a
      convenient place, until there should come a prophet to shew what
      should be done with them.<BR />
      47 Then they took whole stones according to the law, and built
      a new altar according to the former;<BR />
      48 And made up the sanctuary, and the things that were within
      the temple, and hallowed the courts.<BR />
      49 They made also new holy vessels, and into the temple they
      brought the candlestick, and the altar of burnt offerings, and
      of incense, and the table.<BR />
      50 And upon the altar they burned incense, and the lamps that

      24 And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent
      man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.<BR />
      25 This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being
      fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things
      of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.<BR />
      26 And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila
      and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded
      unto him the way of God more perfectly.<BR />
      27 And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren
      wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was
      come, helped them much which had believed through grace:<BR />
      28 For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publicly, showing
      by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.<BR />
      1 And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul
      having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding
      certain disciples,<BR />
      2 He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye
      believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard
      whether there be any Holy Ghost.<BR />

      they said, Unto John's baptism.<BR />
      4 Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance,
      saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which
      should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.<BR />

      said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned
      aside, and sat down.<BR />
      2 And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit
      ye down here. And they sat down.<BR />
      3 And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out
      of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our
      brother Elimelech's:<BR />
      4 And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the
      inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt
      redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell
      me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside thee;
      and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.<BR />
      5 Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand
      of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife
      of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.<BR />
      6 And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I
      mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for
      I cannot redeem it.<BR />
      7 Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning
      redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things;
      a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and
      this was a testimony in Israel.<BR />
      8 Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he

      be done, as in heaven, so in earth.<BR />
      3 Give us day by day our daily bread.<BR />
      4 And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that
      is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver
      us from evil.<BR />
      5 And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and
      shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend
      me three loaves;<BR />
      6 For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have
      nothing to set before him?<BR />
      7 And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the
      door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot
      rise and give thee.<BR />
      8 I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because
      he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise
      and give him as many as he needeth.<BR />
      9 And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and
      ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.<BR />
      10 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth;
      and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.<BR />
      11 If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will
      he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish
      give him a serpent?<BR />
      12 Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?<BR />
      13 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your
      children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy
      Spirit to them that ask him?<BR />

      1 Maccabees 4:52-61</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      52 Now on the five and twentieth day of the ninth month, which
      is called the month Casleu, in the hundred forty and eighth year,
      they rose up betimes in the morning,<BR />
      53 And offered sacrifice according to the law upon the new altar
      of burnt offerings, which they had made.<BR />
      54 Look, at what time and what day the heathen had profaned it,
      even in that was it dedicated with songs, and citherns, and harps,
      and cymbals.<BR />
      55 Then all the people fell upon their faces, worshipping and
      praising the God of heaven, who had given them good success.<BR />
      56 And so they kept the dedication of the altar eight days and
      offered burnt offerings with gladness, and sacrificed the sacrifice
      of deliverance and praise.<BR />
      57 They decked also the forefront of the temple with crowns of
      gold, and with shields; and the gates and the chambers they renewed,
      and hanged doors upon them.<BR />
      58 Thus was there very great gladness among the people, for that
      the reproach of the heathen was put away.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor115363"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">59 Moreover
      Judas and his brethren with the whole congregation of Israel
      ordained, that the days of the dedication of the altar should
      be kept in their season from year to year by the space of eight
      days, from the five and twentieth day of the month Casleu, with
      mirth and gladness.<BR />
      60 At that time also they builded up the mount Sion with high
      walls and strong towers round about, lest the Gentiles should
      come and tread it down as they had done before.<BR />
      61 And they set there a garrison to keep it, and fortified Bethsura
      to preserve it; that the people might have a defence against
      Idumea.<BR />

      the kingdom of God.<BR />

      when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of
      that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated
      the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.<BR />
      10 And this continued by the space of two years; so that all
      they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both
      Jews and Greeks.<BR />
      11 And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:<BR />
      12 So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs
      or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil
      spirits went out of them.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor121229"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">13 Then
      certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call
      over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus,
      saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.<BR />
      14 And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of
      the priests, which did so.<BR />
      15 And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul
      I know; but who are ye?<BR />
      16 And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and
      overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled
      out of that house naked and wounded.<BR />
      17 And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling
      at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord
      Jesus was magnified.<BR />
      18 And many that believed came, and confessed, and showed their
      deeds.<BR />
      19 Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books
      together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the
      price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.<BR />
      20 So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.<BR />

      9 And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye
      are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's,
      and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor129753"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">10 Moreover
      Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be
      my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance,
      that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren,
      and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day.<BR />
      11 And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders,
      said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come
      into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build
      the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be
      famous in Bethlehem:<BR />
      12 And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar
      bare unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of
      this young woman.<BR />
      13 So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went
      in unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son.<BR />
      14 And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which
      hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name
      may be famous in Israel.<BR />
      15 And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher
      of thine old age: for thy daughter-in-law, which loveth thee,
      which is better to thee than seven sons, hath borne him.<BR />
      16 And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became
      nurse unto it.<BR />
      17 And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There
      is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is
      the father of Jesse, the father of David.<BR />

      14 And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came
      to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the
      people wondered.<BR />
      15 But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub
      the chief of the devils.<BR />
      16 And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.<BR />
      17 But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom
      divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house
      divided against a house falleth.<BR />
      18 If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom
      stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.<BR />
      19 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons
      cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.<BR />
      20 But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt
      the kingdom of God is come upon you.<BR />
      21 When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are
      in peace:<BR />
      22 But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome
      him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and
      divideth his spoils.<BR />
      23 He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth
      not with me scattereth.<BR />
      24 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through
      dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will
      return unto my house whence I came out.<BR />
      25 And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.<BR />
      26 Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more
      wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and
      the last state of that man is worse than the first.<BR />
      27 And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman
      of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed
      is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.<BR />
      28 But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word
      of God, and keep it.<BR />

      1 In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came
      Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.<BR />
      2 And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with
      part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into
      the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the
      vessels into the treasure house of his god.<BR />
      3 And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs,
      that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of
      the king's seed, and of the princes;<BR />
      4 Children in whom was no blemish, but wellfavoured, and skilful
      in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science,
      and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace,
      and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the
      Chaldeans.<BR />
      5 And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's
      meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three
      years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.<BR />
      6 Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah,
      Mishael, and Azariah:<BR />
      7 Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave
      unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach;
      and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abed-nego.<BR />
      17 As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill
      in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all
      visions and dreams.<BR />
      18 Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should
      bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in
      before Nebuchadnezzar.<BR />
      19 And the king communed with them; and among them all was found
      none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood

      21 After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit,
      when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem,
      saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.<BR />
      22 So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto
      him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for
      a season.<BR />
      23 And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.<BR />
      24 For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made
      silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;<BR />
      25 Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation,
      and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.<BR />
      26 Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost
      throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away
      much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with
      hands:<BR />
      27 So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at
      nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should
      be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all
      Asia and the world worshippeth.<BR />
      28 And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath,
      and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.<BR />
      29 And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught
      Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in
      travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.<BR />
      30 And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples
      suffered him not.<BR />
      31 And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends,
      sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself
      into the theatre.<BR />
      32 Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the
      assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they
      were come together.<BR />
      33 And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting
      him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would
      have made his defence unto the people.<BR />
      34 But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about
      the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.<BR />
      35 And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye
      men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the
      city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana,
      and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?<BR />
      36 Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye
      ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.<BR />
      37 For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers
      of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.<BR />
      38 Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him,
      have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are
      deputies: let them implead one another.<BR />
      39 But if ye inquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall
      be determined in a lawful assembly.<BR />
      40 For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's
      uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of
      this concourse.<BR />
      41 And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.<BR />

      1 Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of mount Ephraim,
      and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu,
      the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:<BR />
      2 And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the
      name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah
      had no children.<BR />
      3 And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and
      to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons
      of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.<BR />
      4 And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah
      his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:<BR />
      5 But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah:
      but the LORD had shut up her womb.<BR />
      6 And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret,
      because the LORD had shut up her womb.<BR />
      7 And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house
      of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did
      not eat.<BR />
      8 Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou?
      and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not
      I better to thee than ten sons?<BR />
      9 So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after
      they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post
      of the temple of the LORD.<BR />
      10 And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD,
      and wept sore.<BR />
      11 And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt
      indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember
      me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid
      a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days
      of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.<BR />

      Lesson<BR />
      Daniel 2:1-6, 10-13</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar
      dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep
      brake from him.<BR />
      2 Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers,
      and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to show the king his
      dreams. So they came and stood before the king.<BR />
      3 And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my
      spirit was troubled to know the dream.<BR />
      4 Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriac, O king, live
      for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.<BR />
      5 The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone
      from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the
      interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses
      shall be made a dunghill.<BR />
      6 But if ye show the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye
      shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore
      show me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.<BR />
      10 The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is
      not a man upon the earth that can show the king's matter: therefore
      there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at
      any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.<BR />
      11 And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there
      is none other that can show it before the king, except the gods,
      whose dwelling is not with flesh.<BR />
      12 For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded
      to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.<BR />
      13 And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain;
      and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.<BR />

      <A NAME="anchor152625"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Second
      Lesson<BR />
      Acts 20:1-16</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples,
      and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.<BR />
      2 And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much
      exhortation, he came into Greece,<BR />
      3 And there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for
      him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return
      through Macedonia.<BR />
      4 And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of
      the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe,
      and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.<BR />
      5 These going before tarried for us at Troas.<BR />
      6 And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened
      bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode
      seven days.<BR />
      7 And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came
      together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart
      on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.<BR />
      8 And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they
      were gathered together.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor154428"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">9 And
      there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being
      fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he
      sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and
      was taken up dead.<BR />
      10 And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said,
      Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.<BR />
      11 When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread,
      and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so
      he departed.<BR />
      12 And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little
      comforted.<BR />
      13 And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending
      to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to
      go afoot.<BR />
      14 And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came
      to Mitylene.<BR />
      15 And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios;
      and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium;
      and the next day we came to Miletus.<BR />
      16 For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would
      not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible
      for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.<BR />
