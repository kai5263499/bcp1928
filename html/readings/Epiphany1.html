      1 Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD
      is risen upon thee.<BR />
      2 For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross
      darkness the people: but the LORD shall arise upon thee, and
      his glory shall be seen upon thee.<BR />
      3 And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the
      brightness of thy rising.<BR />
      4 Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: all they gather themselves
      together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come from far, and
      thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side.<BR />
      5 Then thou shalt see, and flow together, and thine heart shall
      fear, and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall
      be converted unto thee, the forces of the Gentiles shall come
      unto thee.<BR />
      6 The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of
      Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall
      bring gold and incense; and they shall show forth the praises
      of the LORD.<BR />
      7 All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee,
      the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee: they shall come
      up with acceptance on mine altar, and I will glorify the house
      of my glory.<BR />
      8 Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their
      windows?<BR />
      9 Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish
      first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold
      with them, unto the name of the LORD thy God, and to the Holy
      One of Israel, because he hath glorified thee.<BR />

      Matthew 2:1-12</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days
      of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east
      to Jerusalem,<BR />
      2 Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have
      seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.<BR />
      3 When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled,
      and all Jerusalem with him.<BR />
      4 And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes
      of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should
      be born.<BR />
      5 And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it
      is written by the prophet,<BR />
      6 And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least
      among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor,
      that shall rule my people Israel.<BR />
      7 Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, inquired
      of them diligently what time the star appeared.<BR />
      8 And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently
      for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word
      again, that I may come and worship him also.<BR />
      9 When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star,
      which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and
      stood over where the young child was.<BR />
      10 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great
      joy.<BR />
      11 And when they were come into the house, they saw the young
      child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him:
      and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto
      him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.<BR />
      12 And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return
      to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.<BR />

      1 Samuel 1:21-28 </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      21 And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto
      the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.<BR />
      22 But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will
      not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him,
      that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.<BR />
      23 And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee
      good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish
      his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she
      weaned him.<BR />
      24 And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with
      three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine,
      and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the
      child was young.<BR />
      25 And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.<BR />
      26 And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am
      the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.<BR />
      27 For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition
      which I asked of him:<BR />
      28 Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he
      liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD
      there.<BR />

      Matthew 18:1-14</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who
      is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?<BR />
      2 And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the
      midst of them,<BR />
      3 And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and
      become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom
      of heaven.<BR />
      4 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child,
      the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.<BR />
      5 And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth
      me.<BR />
      6 But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe
      in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about
      his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.<BR />
      7 Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be
      that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!<BR />
      8 Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off,
      and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into
      life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet
      to be cast into everlasting fire.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor258509"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">9 And
      if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee:
      it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather
      than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.<BR />
      10 Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for
      I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold
      the face of my Father which is in heaven.<BR />
      11 For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.<BR />
      12 How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them
      be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth
      into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?<BR />
      13 And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth
      more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not
      astray.<BR />
      14 Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven,
      that one of these little ones should perish.<BR />

      Ezekiel 1:2-6,24-28</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      2 In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of
      king Jehoiachin's captivity,<BR />
      3 The word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest,
      the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar;
      and the hand of the LORD was there upon him.<BR />
      4 And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north,
      a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness
      was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber,
      out of the midst of the fire.<BR />
      5 Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living
      creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness
      of a man.<BR />
      6 And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.<BR />
      24 And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like
      the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the
      voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they
      let down their wings.<BR />
      25 And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their
      heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.<BR />
      26 And above the firmament that was over their heads was the
      likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone:
      and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance
      of a man above upon it.<BR />
      27 And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire
      round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even
      upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I
      saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness
      round about.<BR />

      the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of

      was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD.
      And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of
      one that spake.<BR />

      1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
      the Word was God.<BR />
      2 The same was in the beginning with God.<BR />
      3 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing
      made that was made.<BR />
      4 In him was life; and the life was the light of men.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor294865"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">5 And
      the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended
      it not.<BR />
      6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.<BR />
      7 The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light,
      that all men through him might believe.<BR />
      8 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that
      Light.<BR />
      9 That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh
      into the world.<BR />
      10 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the
      world knew him not.<BR />
      11 He came unto his own, and his own received him not.<BR />
      12 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become
      the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:<BR />
      13 Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh,
      nor of the will of man, but of God.<BR />
      14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld
      his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,)
      full of grace and truth.<BR />
      15 John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of
      whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me:
      for he was before me.<BR />
      16 And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.<BR />
      17 For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by
      Jesus Christ.<BR />
      18 No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which
      is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.<BR />

      19 And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests

      the Christ.<BR />
      21 And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith,
      I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.<BR />
      22 Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an
      answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?<BR />
      23 He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make
      straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.<BR />
      24 And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.<BR />
      25 And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou
      then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?<BR />
      26 John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there
      standeth one among you, whom ye know not;<BR />
      27 He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose
      shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.<BR />
      28 These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John
      was baptizing.<BR />
      29 The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith,
      Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.<BR />
      30 This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is
      preferred before me: for he was before me.<BR />
      31 And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to
      Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.<BR />
      32 And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending
      from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.<BR />
      33 And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water,
      the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending,
      and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the
      Holy Ghost.<BR />
      34 And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.<BR />

      1 And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee;
      and the mother of Jesus was there:<BR />
      2 And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.<BR />
      3 And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him,
      They have no wine.<BR />
      4 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine
      hour is not yet come.<BR />
      5 His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto
      you, do it.<BR />
      6 And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the
      manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three
      firkins apiece.<BR />
      7 Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they
      filled them up to the brim.<BR />
      8 And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor
      of the feast. And they bare it.<BR />
      9 When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made
      wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew
      the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,<BR />
      10 And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth
      good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse:
      but thou hast kept the good wine until now.<BR />
      11 This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and
      manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.<BR />
      12 After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother,
      and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there
      not many days.<BR />

      10 Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth;
      the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.<BR />
      11 Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them
      shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs: neither
      shall there be wailing for them.<BR />
      12 The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer
      rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all the multitude
      thereof.<BR />
      13 For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although
      they were yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude
      thereof, which shall not return; neither shall any strengthen
      himself in the iniquity of his life.<BR />
      14 They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none
      goeth to the battle: for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.<BR />
      15 The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within:
      he that is in the field shall die with the sword; and he that
      is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.<BR />
      23 Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the
      city is full of violence.<BR />

      shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the
      strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.<BR />

      13 And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,<BR />
      14 And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and
      doves, and the changers of money sitting:<BR />
      15 And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them
      all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured
      out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;<BR />
      16 And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence;
      make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.<BR />
      17 And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal
      of thine house hath eaten me up.<BR />
      18 Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign showest
      thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?<BR />
      19 Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and
      in three days I will raise it up.<BR />
      20 Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in
      building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?<BR />
      21 But he spake of the temple of his body.<BR />

      I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk

      one another in love;<BR />

      10 He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above
      all heavens, that he might fill all things.)<BR />
      11 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some,
      evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;<BR />
      12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry,
      for the edifying of the body of Christ:<BR />
      13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge
      of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the
      stature of the fulness of Christ:<BR />
      14 That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro,
      and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight
      of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;<BR />
      15 But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all
      things, which is the head, even Christ:<BR />
      16 From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted
      by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual
      working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the
      body unto the edifying of itself in love.<BR />

      1 There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler

      2 The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi,
      we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can

      3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto
      thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of
      God.<BR />
      4 Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is
      old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and
      be born?<BR />
      5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man
      be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the
      kingdom of God.<BR />
      6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is
      born of the Spirit is spirit.<BR />
      7 Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.<BR />
      8 The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound
      thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it
      goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.<BR />
      9 Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things
      be?<BR />
      10 Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel,
      and knowest not these things?<BR />
      11 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know,
      and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.<BR />
      12 If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how
      shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?<BR />
