      10 Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto
      the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.<BR />
      11 To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me?
      saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and
      the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks,
      or of lambs, or of he goats.<BR />
      12 When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at
      your hand, to tread my courts?<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor380569"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">13 Bring
      no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the
      new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away
      with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.<BR />
      14 Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they
      are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.<BR />
      15 And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes
      from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your
      hands are full of blood.<BR />
      16 Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings
      from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;<BR />
      17 Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge
      the fatherless, plead for the widow.<BR />
      18 Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though
      your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though
      they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.<BR />

      </FONT></B><A NAME="anchor389548"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">12
      Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which
      is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:<BR />
      13 But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings;
      that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with
      exceeding joy.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor390490"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">14 If
      ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the
      spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he
      is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.<BR />
      15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or
      as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.<BR />
      16 Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed;
      but let him glorify God on this behalf.<BR />
      17 For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house
      of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of
      them that obey not the gospel of God?<BR />
      18 And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly
      and the sinner appear?<BR />
      19 Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God
      commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto
      a faithful Creator.<BR />

      he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.<BR />
      2 After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will
      raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.<BR />
      3 Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his going

      the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.<BR />
      4 O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I
      do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as
      the early dew it goeth away.<BR />
      5 Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them

      Hebrews 10:1-25</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not
      the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices
      which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto
      perfect.<BR />
      2 For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because
      that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience
      of sins.<BR />
      3 But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of
      sins every year.<BR />
      4 For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats
      should take away sins.<BR />
      5 Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice
      and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared
      me:<BR />
      6 In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no
      pleasure.<BR />
      7 Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written
      of me,) to do thy will, O God.<BR />
      8 Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings
      and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure
      therein; which are offered by the law;<BR />
      9 Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away
      the first, that he may establish the second.<BR />
      10 By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of
      the body of Jesus Christ once for all.<BR />
      11 And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes
      the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:<BR />
      12 But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins
      for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;<BR />
      13 From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.<BR />
      14 For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are
      sanctified.<BR />
      15 Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after
      that he had said before,<BR />
      16 This is the covenant that I will make with them after those
      days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and
      in their minds will I write them;<BR />
      17 And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.<BR />
      18 Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering
      for sin.<BR />
      19 Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest
      by the blood of Jesus,<BR />
      20 By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us,
      through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;<BR />
      21 And having an high priest over the house of God;<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor404329"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">22 Let
      us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having
      our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies

      us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for
      he is faithful that promised;)<BR />
      24 And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to
      good works:<BR />
      25 Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the
      manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the
      more, as ye see the day approaching.<BR />

      1 Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest
      of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert,
      and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.<BR />
      2 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire
      out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush
      burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.<BR />
      3 And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight,
      why the bush is not burnt.<BR />
      4 And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called
      unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses.
      And he said, Here am I.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor410348"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">5 And
      he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy
      feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.<BR />
      6 Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham,
      the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face;
      for he was afraid to look upon God.<BR />
      7 And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my
      people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason
      of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;<BR />
      8 And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians,
      and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a
      large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place
      of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the
      Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.<BR />
      9 Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is
      come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the
      Egyptians oppress them.<BR />
      10 Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that
      thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out
      of Egypt.<BR />
      11 And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh,
      and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?<BR />
      12 And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall
      be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought
      forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.<BR />
      13 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children
      of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath
      sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name?
      what shall I say unto them?<BR />
      14 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus
      shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me
      unto you.<BR />
      15 And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto
      the children of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God
      of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent
      me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial
      unto all generations.<BR />

      12 Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how
      say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?<BR />
      13 But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ
      not risen:<BR />
      14 And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and
      your faith is also vain.<BR />
      15 Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have
      testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not
      up, if so be that the dead rise not.<BR />
      16 For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:<BR />
      17 And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet

      7 O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived: thou art
      stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision daily,
      every one mocketh me.<BR />
      8 For since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil;
      because the word of the LORD was made a reproach unto me, and
      a derision, daily.<BR />
      9 Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any
      more in his name. But his word was in mine heart as a burning
      fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and
      I could not stay.<BR />
      10 For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report,
      say they, and we will report it. All my familiars watched for
      my halting, saying, Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall
      prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.<BR />
      11 But the LORD is with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore
      my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they

      1 Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where
      Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.<BR />
      2 There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus
      was one of them that sat at the table with him.<BR />
      3 Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly,
      and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair:
      and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.<BR />
      4 Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son,
      which should betray him,<BR />
      5 Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and
      given to the poor?<BR />
      6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he
      was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.<BR />
      7 Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying
      hath she kept this.<BR />
      8 For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.<BR />
      9 Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and
      they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus
      also, whom he had raised from the dead.<BR />
      10 But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus
      also to death;<BR />
      11 Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away,
      and believed on Jesus.<BR />

      And Moses said unto the LORD, O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither
      heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but
      I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.<BR />
      11 And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or
      who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have
      not I the LORD?<BR />
      12 Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach
      thee what thou shalt say.<BR />
      13 And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of
      him whom thou wilt send.<BR />
      14 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he
      said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can
      speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and
      when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.<BR />
      15 And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth:
      and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach
      you what ye shall do.<BR />
      16 And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall
      be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt
      be to him instead of God.<BR />
      17 And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou
      shalt do signs.<BR />
      18 And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and
      said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren
      which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro
      said to Moses, Go in peace.<BR />
      27 And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet
      Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed
      him.<BR />
      28 And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent
      him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.<BR />
      29 And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders
      of the children of Israel:<BR />

      20 But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits

      21 For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection
      of the dead.<BR />
      22 For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made
      alive.<BR />
      23 But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward
      they that are Christ's at his coming.<BR />
      24 Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom
      to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule
      and all authority and power.<BR />
      25 For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his
      feet.<BR />
      26 The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.<BR />
      27 For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith
      all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted,

      1 And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus
      saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may
      hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.<BR />
      2 And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice
      to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel
      go.<BR />
      3 And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let
      us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and
      sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence,
      or with the sword.<BR />
      4 And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses
      and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your
      burdens.<BR />
      5 And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many,
      and ye make them rest from their burdens.<BR />
      6 And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people,
      and their officers, saying,<BR />
      7 Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore:
      let them go and gather straw for themselves.<BR />
      8 And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore,
      ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish aught thereof:
      for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice
      to our God.<BR />
      9 Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour
      therein; and let them not regard vain words.<BR />
      19 And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they
      were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish aught
      from your bricks of your daily task.<BR />
      20 And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they
      came forth from Pharaoh:<BR />
      21 And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge;
      because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of
      Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their
      hand to slay us.<BR />
      22 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Lord, wherefore
      hast thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou
      hast sent me?<BR />
      23 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath
      done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people
      at all.<BR />
      1 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will

      35 But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with

      36 Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except

      37 And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that

      38 But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every

      39 All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of
      flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and

      40 There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but
      the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial
      is another.<BR />
      41 There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon,

      44 It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.
      There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.<BR />

      1 And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the

      fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which
      was of Gibeon, spake unto me in the house of the LORD, in the
      presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,<BR />
      2 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying,
      I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.<BR />
      10 Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet
      Jeremiah's neck, and brake it.<BR />
      11 And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying,
      Thus saith the LORD; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar
      king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space
      of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.<BR />
      12 Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the prophet,
      after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off
      the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,<BR />
      13 Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast
      broken the yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes
      of iron.<BR />
      14 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have
      put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they
      may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve
      him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.<BR />
      15 Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet,
      Hear now, Hananiah; The LORD hath not sent thee; but thou makest
      this people to trust in a lie.<BR />
      16 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will cast thee from
      off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because
      thou hast taught rebellion against the LORD.<BR />

      34 The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that
      Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man
      must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?<BR />
      35 Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light
      with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon
      you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.<BR />
      36 While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be
      the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed,
      and did hide himself from them.<BR />
      37 But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they
      believed not on him:<BR />
      38 That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled,
      which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom
      hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?<BR />
      39 Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said
      again,<BR />
      40 He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that
      they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their
      heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.<BR />
      41 These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake
      of him.<BR />
      42 Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on
      him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest
      they should be put out of the synagogue:<BR />

      29 And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the

      that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that
      was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.<BR />
      30 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants,
      and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for
      there was not a house where there was not one dead.<BR />
      31 And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise
      up, and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children
      of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.<BR />
      32 Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and
      be gone; and bless me also.<BR />
      33 And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might
      send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all
      dead men.<BR />
      34 And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their
      kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.<BR />
      35 And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses;
      and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels
      of gold, and raiment:<BR />
      36 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians,
      so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And
      they spoiled the Egyptians.<BR />
      37 And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth,
      about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.<BR />
      38 And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks,
      and herds, even very much cattle.<BR />
      39 And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought
      forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were
      thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared
      for themselves any victual.<BR />

      1 Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that
      his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto
      the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he
      loved them unto the end.<BR />
      2 And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart
      of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;<BR />
      3 Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his
      hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;<BR />
      4 He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took
      a towel, and girded himself.<BR />
      5 After that he poureth water into a basin, and began to wash
      the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith
      he was girded.<BR />
      6 Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord,
      dost thou wash my feet?<BR />
      7 Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not
      now; but thou shalt know hereafter.<BR />
      8 Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus
      answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.<BR />
      9 Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also
      my hands and my head.<BR />
      10 Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to
      wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but
      not all.<BR />
      11 For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are
      not all clean.<BR />
      12 So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments,
      and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have
      done to you?<BR />
      13 Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.<BR />
      14 If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye
      also ought to wash one another's feet.<BR />
      15 For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have
      done to you.<BR />
      16 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater
      than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent
      him.<BR />
      17 If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.<BR />
