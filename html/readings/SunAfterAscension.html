      5 The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled
      Zion with judgment and righteousness.<BR />

      and strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD is his treasure.<BR />

      neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.<BR />

      John 17</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven,
      and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy
      Son also may glorify thee:<BR />
      2 As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should
      give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.<BR />
      3 And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only
      true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.<BR />
      4 I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work
      which thou gavest me to do.<BR />
      5 And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with
      the glory which I had with thee before the world was.<BR />
      6 I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me
      out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and
      they have kept thy word.<BR />
      7 Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given
      me are of thee.<BR />
      8 For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me;
      and they have received them, and have known surely that I came
      out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.<BR />
      9 I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which
      thou hast given me; for they are thine.<BR />
      10 And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified
      in them.<BR />
      11 And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world,
      and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name
      those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.<BR />
      12 While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name:
      those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost,
      but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.<BR />
      13 And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world,
      that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.<BR />
      14 I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them,
      because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.<BR />
      15 I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world,
      but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.<BR />
      16 They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.<BR />
      17 Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.<BR />
      18 As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent
      them into the world.<BR />
      19 And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might
      be sanctified through the truth.<BR />
      20 Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall
      believe on me through their word;<BR />
      21 That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and
      I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may
      believe that thou hast sent me.<BR />
      22 And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that
      they may be one, even as we are one:<BR />
      23 I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in
      one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and
      hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.<BR />
      24 Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be
      with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou
      hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the
      world.<BR />
      25 O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have
      known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.<BR />
      26 And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it:
      that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and
      I in them.<BR />

      Wisdom 9</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 O GOD of my fathers, and Lord of mercy, who hast made all things
      with thy word,<BR />
      2 And ordained man through thy wisdom, that he should have dominion
      over the creatures which thou hast made,<BR />
      3 And order the world according to equity and righteousness,
      and execute judgment with an upright heart:<BR />
      4 Give me wisdom, that sitteth by thy throne; and reject me not
      from among thy children:<BR />
      5 For I thy servant and son of thine handmaid am a feeble person,
      and of a short time, and too young for the understanding of judgment
      and laws.<BR />
      6 For though a man be never so perfect among the children of
      men, yet if thy wisdom be not with him, he shall be nothing regarded.<BR />
      7 Thou hast chosen me to be a king of thy people, and a judge
      of thy sons and daughters<BR />
      8 Thou hast commanded me to build a temple upon thy holy mount
      and an altar in the city wherein thou dwellest, a resemblance
      of the holy tabernacle, which thou hast prepared from the beginning.<BR />
      9 And wisdom was with thee: which knoweth thy works, and was
      present when thou madest the world, and knew what was acceptable
      in thy sight, and right in thy commandments.<BR />
      10 O send her out of thy holy heavens, and from the throne of
      thy glory, that being present she may labour with me, that I
      may know what is pleasing unto thee.<BR />
      11 For she knoweth and understandeth all things, and she shall
      lead me soberly in my doings, and preserve me in her power.<BR />
      12 So shall my works be acceptable, and then shall I judge thy
      people righteously, and be worthy to sit in my father's seat.<BR />
      13 For what man is he that can know the counsel of God? or who
      can think what the will of the Lord is?<BR />
      14 For the thoughts of mortal men are miserable, and our devices
      are but uncertain.<BR />
      15 For the corruptible body presseth down the soul, and the earthy
      tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth upon many things.<BR />
      16 And hardly do we guess aright at things that are upon earth,
      and with labour do we find the things that are before us: but
      the things that are in heaven who hath searched out?<BR />
      17 And thy counsel who hath known, except thou give wisdom, and
      send thy Holy Spirit from above?<BR />
      18 For so the ways of them which lived on the earth were reformed,
      and men were taught the things that are pleasing unto thee, and
      were saved through wisdom.<BR />

      2 Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the
      Lord Jesus Christ.<BR />

      8 Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;<BR />
      9 Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according
      to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:<BR />
      10 That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might
      gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in
      heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:<BR />
      11 In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated
      according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after
      the counsel of his own will:<BR />
      12 That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted
      in Christ.<BR />
      13 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth,

      my prayers;<BR />
      17 That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory,
      may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the
      knowledge of him:<BR />

      may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches
      of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,<BR />
      19 And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward
      who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,<BR />
      20 Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead,
      and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,<BR />
      21 Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion,
      and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also
      in that which is to come:<BR />
      22 And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be
      the head over all things to the church,<BR />
      23 Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in
      all.<BR />

      1 Samuel 2:1b-10</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 My mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in
      thy salvation.<BR />
      2 There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee:
      neither is there any rock like our God.<BR />
      3 Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out
      of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him
      actions are weighed.<BR />
      4 The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled
      are girded with strength.<BR />
      5 They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and
      they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven;
      and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.<BR />
      6 The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the
      grave, and bringeth up.<BR />
      7 The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and
      lifteth up.<BR />
      8 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the
      beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make
      them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth
      are the LORD'S, and he hath set the world upon them.<BR />
      9 He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be
      silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.<BR />
      10 The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out
      of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the
      ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king,
      and exalt the horn of his anointed.<BR />

      1 And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a
      book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.<BR />
      2 And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who
      is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?<BR />
      3 And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth,
      was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.<BR />
      4 And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and
      to read the book, neither to look thereon.<BR />
      5 And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the
      Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed
      to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.<BR />
      6 And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the
      four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as
      it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are
      the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.<BR />
      7 And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him
      that sat upon the throne.<BR />
      8 And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and
      twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of
      them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers
      of saints.<BR />
      9 And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the
      book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and
      hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and
      tongue, and people, and nation;<BR />
      10 And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall
      reign on the earth.<BR />
      11 And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about
      the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them
      was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;<BR />
      12 Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain
      to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour,
      and glory, and blessing.<BR />
      13 And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and
      under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are
      in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and
      power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the
      Lamb for ever and ever.<BR />
      14 And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders
      fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.<BR />

      Acts 2:22-36</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      22 Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man
      approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs,
      which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also
      know:<BR />
      23 Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge
      of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and
      slain:<BR />
      24 Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death:
      because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.<BR />
      25 For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always
      before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not
      be moved:<BR />
      26 Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover
      also my flesh shall rest in hope:<BR />
      27 Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt
      thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.<BR />
      28 Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make
      me full of joy with thy countenance.<BR />
      29 Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch
      David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is
      with us unto this day.<BR />
      30 Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn
      with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according
      to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;<BR />
      31 He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ,
      that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see
      corruption.<BR />
      32 This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.<BR />
      33 Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having
      received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath
      shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.<BR />

      18 Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said,
      Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast brought
      me hitherto?<BR />
      19 And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but
      thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while
      to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?<BR />
      20 And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD,
      knowest thy servant.<BR />
      21 For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast
      thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know them.<BR />
      22 Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like
      thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all
      that we have heard with our ears.<BR />
      23 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even
      like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself,
      and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible,
      for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee
      from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?<BR />
      24 For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be
      a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their
      God.<BR />
      25 And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning
      thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever,
      and do as thou hast said.<BR />
      26 And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of
      hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant
      David be established before thee.<BR />
      27 For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to
      thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath
      thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.<BR />
      28 And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true,
      and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:<BR />
      29 Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy
      servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou,
      O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house
      of thy servant be blessed for ever.<BR />

      11 And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that,

      The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they

      the light shined.<BR />

      they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as
      men rejoice when they divide the spoil.<BR />

      11 And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John,
      all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called
      Solomon's, greatly wondering.<BR />
      12 And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men
      of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly
      on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this
      man to walk?<BR />
      13 The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of
      our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered
      up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined
      to let him go.<BR />
      14 But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer
      to be granted unto you;<BR />
      15 And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the
      dead; whereof we are witnesses.<BR />
      16 And his name through faith in his name hath made this man
      strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him
      hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you
      all.<BR />
      17 And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it,
      as did also your rulers.<BR />

      after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these
      days.<BR />
      25 Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which

      And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the
      seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me,
      saying, Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.<BR />
      10 And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain,
      and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending
      out of heaven from God,<BR />
      11 Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone
      most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;<BR />
      12 And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at
      the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are
      the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:<BR />
      13 On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the
      south three gates; and on the west three gates.<BR />
      14 And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them
      the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.<BR />
      15 And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the
      city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.<BR />
      16 And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large
      as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve
      thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height
      of it are equal.<BR />
      17 And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and
      four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the
      angel.<BR />
      18 And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the
      city was pure gold, like unto clear glass.<BR />
      19 And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished
      with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was
      jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth,
      an emerald;<BR />
      20 The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite;
      the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus;
      the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.<BR />
      21 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate
      was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as
      it were transparent glass.<BR />
      22 And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and
      the Lamb are the temple of it.<BR />
      23 And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon,
      to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the
      Lamb is the light thereof.<BR />
      24 And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the

      27 And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth,
      neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but
      they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.<BR />

      15 For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;
      but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry,
      Abba, Father.<BR />
      16 The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we
      are the children of God:<BR />

      if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ;
      if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified
      together.<BR />
      18 For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are
      not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed
      in us.<BR />
