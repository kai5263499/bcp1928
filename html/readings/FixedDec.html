      First Lesson<BR />
      2 Samuel 15:17-21</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      17 And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and
      tarried in a place that was far off.<BR />
      18 And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites,
      and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men
      which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.<BR />
      19 Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou
      also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for
      thou art a stranger, and also an exile.<BR />
      20 Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make
      thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return
      thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with thee.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor283936"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">21 And
      Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and as
      my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king
      shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy
      servant be.<BR />

      John 11:1-16</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the
      town of Mary and her sister Martha.<BR />
      2 (It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and
      wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)<BR />
      3 Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold,
      he whom thou lovest is sick.<BR />
      4 When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death,
      but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified
      thereby.<BR />
      5 Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.<BR />
      6 When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two
      days still in the same place where he was.<BR />
      7 Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea
      again.<BR />
      8 His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought
      to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor352857"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">9 Jesus
      answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk
      in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this
      world.<BR />
      10 But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there
      is no light in him.<BR />
      11 These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our
      friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of
      sleep.<BR />
      12 Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.<BR />
      13 Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he
      had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.<BR />
      14 Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.<BR />
      15 And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the
      intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor359835"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">16 Then
      said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples,
      Let us also go, that we may die with him.<BR />

      1 Then Job answered the LORD, and said,<BR />
      2 I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought
      can be withholden from thee.<BR />
      3 Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore
      have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for
      me, which I knew not.<BR />
      4 Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee,
      and declare thou unto me.<BR />
      5 I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine

      1 Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe
      also in me.<BR />
      2 In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so,
      I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.<BR />
      3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again,
      and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be
      also.<BR />
      4 And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.<BR />
      5 Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest;
      and how can we know the way?<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor383411"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">6 Jesus
      saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man

      from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.<BR />

      Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that
      have ears.<BR />
      9 Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people
      be assembled: who among them can declare this, and show us former
      things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be
      justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth.<BR />
      10 Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I
      have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand
      that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall
      there be after me.<BR />
      11 I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is no saviour.<BR />
      12 I have declared, and have saved, and I have shown, when there
      was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses,
      saith the LORD, that I am God.<BR />
      13 Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can
      deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?<BR />
