      Zechariah 8:1-8,20-23</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Again the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,<BR />
      2 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with great
      jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury.<BR />
      3 Thus saith the LORD; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell
      in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city
      of truth; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain.<BR />
      4 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old
      women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his
      staff in his hand for very age.<BR />
      5 And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls
      playing in the streets thereof.<BR />
      6 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it be marvellous in the eyes
      of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be
      marvellous in mine eyes? saith the LORD of hosts.<BR />
      7 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will save my people
      from the east country, and from the west country;<BR />
      8 And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of
      Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God,
      in truth and in righteousness.<BR />
      20 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; It shall yet come to pass, that
      there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities:<BR />
      21 And the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying,
      Let us go speedily to pray before the LORD, and to seek the LORD
      of hosts: I will go also.<BR />
      22 Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the
      LORD of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the LORD.<BR />
      23 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; In those days it shall come
      to pass, that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of
      the nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is
      a Jew, saying, We will go with you: for we have heard that God
      is with you.<BR />

      1 Corinthians 12:12-31a</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      12 For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the
      members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is
      Christ.<BR />
      13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether
      we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have
      been all made to drink into one Spirit.<BR />
      14 For the body is not one member, but many.<BR />
      15 If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not
      of the body; is it therefore not of the body?<BR />
      16 And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not
      of the body; is it therefore not of the body?<BR />
      17 If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If
      the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?<BR />
      18 But now hath God set the members every one of them in the
      body, as it hath pleased him<BR />
      19 And if they were all one member, where were the body?<BR />
      20 But now are they many members, yet but one body.<BR />
      21 And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee:
      nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.<BR />
      22 Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be
      more feeble, are necessary:<BR />
      23 And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable,
      upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts
      have more abundant comeliness.<BR />
      24 For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the
      body together, having given more abundant honour to that part
      which lacked:<BR />
      25 That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members
      should have the same care one for another.<BR />
      26 And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with
      it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.<BR />
      27 Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.<BR />
      28 And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily
      prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of
      healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.<BR />
      29 Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are
      all workers of miracles?<BR />
      30 Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues?
      do all interpret?<BR />
      31 But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet show I unto you
      a more excellent way.<BR />

      1 Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right
      hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will
      loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates;
      and the gates shall not be shut;<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor214276"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">2 I will
      go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I will
      break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars
      of iron:<BR />
      3 And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden
      riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the LORD,
      which call thee by thy name, am the God of Israel.<BR />
      4 For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, I have
      even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou
      hast not known me.<BR />
      5 I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside
      me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:<BR />
      6 That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the
      west, that there is none beside me. I am the LORD, and there
      is none else.<BR />
      7 I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create
      evil: I the LORD do all these things.<BR />
      8 Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down
      righteousness: let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation,
      and let righteousness spring up together; I the LORD have created
      it.<BR />
      9 Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let the potsherd
      strive with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to
      him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath
      no hands?<BR />
      10 Woe unto him that saith unto his father, What begettest thou?
      or to the woman, What hast thou brought forth?<BR />
      11 Thus saith the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker,
      Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the
      work of my hands command ye me.<BR />
      12 I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my
      hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have
      I commanded.<BR />
      13 I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all
      his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives,
      not for price nor reward, saith the LORD of hosts.<BR />
      14 Thus saith the LORD, The labour of Egypt, and merchandise
      of Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over
      unto thee, and they shall be thine: they shall come after thee;
      in chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down unto
      thee, they shall make supplication unto thee, saying, Surely
      God is in thee; and there is none else, there is no God.<BR />
      15 Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel,
      the Saviour.<BR />

      14 What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God?
      God forbid.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor218672"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">15 For
      he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,
      and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.<BR />
      16 So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth,
      but of God that showeth mercy.<BR />
      17 For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose
      have I raised thee up, that I might show my power in thee, and
      that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.<BR />
      18 Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom
      he will he hardeneth.<BR />
      19 Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For
      who hath resisted his will?<BR />
      20 Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall
      the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made
      me thus?<BR />
      21 Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump
      to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?<BR />
      22 What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power
      known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted
      to destruction:<BR />
      23 And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the
      vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,<BR />
      24 Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also
      of the Gentiles?<BR />
      25 As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which
      were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.<BR />
      26 And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was
      said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called
      the children of the living God.<BR />

      This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth

      18 Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the
      life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of

      19 Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness,

      20 But ye have not so learned Christ;<BR />
      21 If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him,
      as the truth is in Jesus:<BR />
      22 That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old
      man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;<BR />
      23 And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;<BR />
      24 And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created
      in righteousness and true holiness.<BR />
      25 Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his
      neighbour: for we are members one of another.<BR />
      26 Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your

      27 Neither give place to the devil.<BR />

      of man, what is that proverb that ye have in the land of Israel,

      17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world;
      but that the world through him might be saved.<BR />
      18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth

      this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world,

      for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of
      the LORD.<BR />

      22 After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land
      of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.<BR />
      23 And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because
      there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.<BR />
      24 For John was not yet cast into prison.<BR />
      25 Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples
      and the Jews about purifying.<BR />
      26 And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that
      was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold,
      the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.<BR />
      27 John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except
      it be given him from heaven.<BR />
      28 Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ,
      but that I am sent before him.<BR />
      29 He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of
      the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly
      because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.<BR />
      30 He must increase, but I must decrease.<BR />
      31 He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the

      heaven is above all.<BR />
      32 And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no

      33 He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that

      19 Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,

      28 So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that
      loveth his wife loveth himself.<BR />
      29 For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and
      cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:<BR />
      30 For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.<BR />
      31 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and
      shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.<BR />
      32 This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and
      the church.<BR />
      33 Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his
      wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her

      1 When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that

      2 (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)<BR />
      3 He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.<BR />

      5 Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar,
      near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.<BR />
      6 Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied
      with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the
      sixth hour.<BR />
      7 There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith
      unto her, Give me to drink.<BR />
      8 (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)<BR />
      9 Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou,
      being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria?
      for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.<BR />
      10 Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift
      of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou
      wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living
      water.<BR />
      11 The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with,
      and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living
      water?<BR />
      12 Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the
      well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?<BR />
      13 Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this
      water shall thirst again:<BR />
      14 But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him
      shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall
      be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.<BR />

      23 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever
      the earth was.<BR />
      24 When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there
      were no fountains abounding with water.<BR />
      25 Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I
      brought forth:<BR />
      26 While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor
      the highest part of the dust of the world.<BR />
      27 When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass
      upon the face of the depth:<BR />
      28 When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened
      the fountains of the deep:<BR />
      29 When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should
      not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of
      the earth:<BR />
      30 Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily
      his delight, rejoicing always before him;<BR />
      31 Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights
      were with the sons of men.<BR />

      water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick
      at Capernaum.<BR />
      47 When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee,
