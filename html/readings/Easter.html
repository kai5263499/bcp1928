      1 O LORD, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy
      name; for thou hast done wonderful things; thy counsels of old
      are faithfulness and truth.<BR />
      2 For thou hast made of a city an heap; of a defenced city a
      ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be
      built.<BR />
      3 Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of
      the terrible nations shall fear thee.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor192783"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">4 For
      thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy
      in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat,
      when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the
      wall.<BR />
      5 Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in
      a dry place; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch
      of the terrible ones shall be brought low.<BR />
      6 And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all
      people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of
      fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.<BR />
      7 And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering
      cast over all people, and the veil that is spread over all nations.<BR />
      8 He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will
      wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people
      shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD hath
      spoken it.<BR />
      9 And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have
      waited for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD; we have
      waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.<BR />

      1 In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first
      day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see
      the sepulchre.<BR />
      2 And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of
      the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the
      stone from the door, and sat upon it.<BR />
      3 His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as
      snow:<BR />
      4 And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead
      men.<BR />
      5 And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye:
      for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.<BR />
      6 He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the
      place where the Lord lay.<BR />
      7 And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from
      the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there
      shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.<BR />
      8 And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and
      great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.<BR />
      9 And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them,
      saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and
      worshipped him.<BR />
      10 Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren
      that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.<BR />
      16 Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain
      where Jesus had appointed them.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor196442"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">17 And
      when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.<BR />
      18 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given
      unto me in heaven and in earth.<BR />
      19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in
      the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:<BR />
      20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded
      you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the
      world. Amen.<BR />

      9 Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as
      in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not
      it that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?<BR />
      10 Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the
      great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the
      ransomed to pass over?<BR />
      11 Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come
      with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their
      head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning
      shall flee away.<BR />
      12 I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou
      shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of
      man which shall be made as grass;<BR />
      13 And forgettest the LORD thy maker, that hath stretched forth
      the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast
      feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor,
      as if he were ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the
      oppressor?<BR />
      14 The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that
      he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.<BR />
      15 But I am the LORD thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves
      roared: The LORD of hosts is his name.<BR />

      Luke 24:13-35</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      13 And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called
      Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.<BR />
      14 And they talked together of all these things which had happened.<BR />
      15 And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and
      reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.<BR />
      16 But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.<BR />
      17 And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these
      that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?<BR />
      18 And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said
      unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not
      known the things which are come to pass there in these days?<BR />
      19 And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him,
      Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed
      and word before God and all the people:<BR />
      20 And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to
      be condemned to death, and have crucified him.<BR />
      21 But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed
      Israel: and beside all this, today is the third day since these
      things were done.<BR />
      22 Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished,
      which were early at the sepulchre;<BR />
      23 And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that
      they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was
      alive.<BR />
      24 And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre,
      and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw
      not.<BR />
      25 Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe
      all that the prophets have spoken:<BR />
      26 Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter
      into his glory?<BR />
      27 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded
      unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.<BR />
      28 And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and
      he made as though he would have gone further.<BR />
      29 But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is
      toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry
      with them.<BR />
      30 And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took
      bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.<BR />
      31 And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished
      out of their sight.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor206297"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">32 And
      they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while
      he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?<BR />
      33 And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem,
      and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with
      them,<BR />
      34 Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.<BR />
      35 And they told what things were done in the way, and how he
      was known of them in breaking of bread.<BR />

      1 Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning,

      had prepared, and certain others with them.<BR />
      2 And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.<BR />

      behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:<BR />
      5 And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the
      earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the
      dead?<BR />
      6 He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you
      when he was yet in Galilee,<BR />

      sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.<BR />
      8 And they remembered his words,<BR />
      9 And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things
      unto the eleven, and to all the rest.<BR />
      10 It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of

      13 But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning
      them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which
      have no hope.<BR />
      14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so
      them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.<BR />
      15 For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we
      which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
      not prevent them which are asleep.<BR />
      16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,
      with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and
      the dead in Christ shall rise first:<BR />
      17 Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together
      with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so
      shall we ever be with the Lord.<BR />
      18 Wherefore comfort one another with these words.<BR />

      11 But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she
      wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre,<BR />
      12 And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head,
      and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.<BR />
      13 And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith
      unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not
      where they have laid him.<BR />
      14 And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw
      Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.<BR />
      15 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest
      thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him,
      Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid
      him, and I will take him away.<BR />
      16 Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith
      unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.<BR />
      17 Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended
      to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend
      unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.<BR />

      1 The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the
      spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley
      which was full of bones,<BR />
      2 And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there
      were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry.<BR />
      3 And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And
      I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest.<BR />
      4 Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto
      them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.<BR />
      5 Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause
      breath to enter into you, and ye shall live:<BR />
      6 And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon
      you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall
      live; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.<BR />
      7 So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there
      was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together,
      bone to his bone.<BR />
      8 And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon
      them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath
      in them.<BR />
      9 Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son
      of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from
      the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that
      they may live.<BR />
      10 So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into
      them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding
      great army.<BR />
      11 Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole
      house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our
      hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.<BR />
      12 Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord
      GOD; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause
      you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land
      of Israel.<BR />
      13 And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your
      graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves,<BR />
      14 And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall

      22 They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not
      plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days
      of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their
      hands.<BR />
      23 They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble;
      for they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring
      with them.<BR />
      24 And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer;
      and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.<BR />
      25 The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall
      eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent's meat.
      They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith
      the LORD.<BR />

      9 I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation,
      and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle
      that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony
      of Jesus Christ.<BR />
      10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me
      a great voice, as of a trumpet,<BR />
      11 Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and,
      What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven
      churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and
      unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia,
      and unto Laodicea.<BR />
      12 And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being
      turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;<BR />
      13 And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the
      Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt
      about the paps with a golden girdle.<BR />
      14 His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow;
      and his eyes were as a flame of fire;<BR />
      15 And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a
      furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.<BR />
      16 And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth
      went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun
      shineth in his strength.<BR />
      17 And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid
      his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first
      and the last:<BR />
      18 I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive
      for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.<BR />

      Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice
      with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.<BR />

      he will joy over thee with singing.<BR />
      18 I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly,
      who are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burden.<BR />
      19 Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and
      I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven
      out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where
      they have been put to shame.<BR />

      John 21:1-14</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 After these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples
      at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise showed he himself.<BR />
      2 There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus,
      and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and
      two other of his disciples.<BR />
      3 Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a-fishing. They say unto
      him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into
      a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.<BR />
      4 But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore:
      but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.<BR />
      5 Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They
      answered him, No.<BR />
      6 And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the
      ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were
      not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.<BR />
      7 Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter,
      It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord,
      he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did
      cast himself into the sea.<BR />
      8 And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were
      not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging
      the net with fishes.<BR />
      9 As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of
      coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.<BR />
      10 Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now
      caught.<BR />
      11 Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great
      fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were
      so many, yet was not the net broken.<BR />
      12 Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples
      durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.<BR />
      13 Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and
      fish likewise.<BR />
      14 This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to his
      disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.<BR />

      15 So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon,
      son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him,
      Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him,
      Feed my lambs.<BR />
      16 He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas,
      lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that
      I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.<BR />
      17 He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest
      thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third
      time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest
      all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him,
      Feed my sheep.<BR />
      18 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou
      girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when
      thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another
      shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.<BR />
      19 This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify
      God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.<BR />
      20 Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved
      following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said,
      Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?<BR />
      21 Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this
      man do?<BR />
      22 Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come,
      what is that to thee? follow thou me.<BR />
      23 Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that
      disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall
      not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that
      to thee?<BR />
      24 This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and
      wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.<BR />
      25 And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the
      which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even
      the world itself could not contain the books that should be written.
      Amen.<BR />
