      8 But thou, Israel, art my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen,

      9 Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called
      thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou art

      thee with the right hand of my righteousness.<BR />
      17 When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and
      their tongue faileth for thirst, I the LORD will hear them, I
      the God of Israel will not forsake them.<BR />
      18 I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst
      of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and
      the dry land springs of water.<BR />
      19 I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree,
      and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the
      fir tree, and the pine, and the box tree together:<BR />
      20 That they may see, and know, and consider, and understand
      together, that the hand of the LORD hath done this, and the Holy
      One of Israel hath created it.<BR />

      John 4:1-14</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that
      Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,<BR />
      2 (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)<BR />
      3 He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.<BR />
      4 And he must needs go through Samaria.<BR />
      5 Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar,
      near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.<BR />
      6 Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied
      with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the
      sixth hour.<BR />
      7 There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith
      unto her, Give me to drink.<BR />
      8 (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)<BR />
      9 Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou,
      being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria?
      for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.<BR />
      10 Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift
      of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou
      wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living
      water.<BR />
      11 The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with,
      and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living
      water?<BR />
      12 Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the
      well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?<BR />
      13 Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this
      water shall thirst again:<BR />
      14 But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him
      shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall
      be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.<BR />

      Thus saith the LORD, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my
      salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.<BR />
      2 Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that
      layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it,
      and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.<BR />
      3 Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself
      to the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD hath utterly separated me
      from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry
      tree.<BR />
      4 For thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths,
      and choose the things that please me, and take hold of my covenant;<BR />
      5 Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls
      a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will
      give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.<BR />
      6 Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the
      LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his
      servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it,
      and taketh hold of my covenant;<BR />
      7 Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful
      in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices
      shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be called
      an house of prayer for all people.<BR />
      8 The Lord GOD which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith,
      Yet will I gather others to him, beside those that are gathered
      unto him.<BR />

      John 2:13-25</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      13 And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,<BR />
      14 And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and
      doves, and the changers of money sitting:<BR />
      15 And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them
      all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured
      out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;<BR />
      16 And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence;
      make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.<BR />
      17 And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal
      of thine house hath eaten me up.<BR />
      18 Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign showest
      thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?<BR />
      19 Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and
      in three days I will raise it up.<BR />
      20 Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in
      building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?<BR />
      21 But he spake of the temple of his body.<BR />
      22 When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered
      that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture,
      and the word which Jesus had said.<BR />
      23 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast
      day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which
      he did.<BR />
      24 But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew
      all men,<BR />
      25 And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew
      what was in man.<BR />

      27 Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of
      Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I
      may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with

      to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;<BR />
      30 Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear
      to be in me.<BR />

      of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,<BR />
      2 Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love,

      the things of others.<BR />
      5 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:<BR />
      6 Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be
      equal with God:<BR />
      7 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form
      of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:<BR />
      8 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and
      became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.<BR />
      9 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a
      name which is above every name:<BR />
      10 That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things
      in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;<BR />
      11 And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is
      Lord, to the glory of God the Father.<BR />

      1 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,<BR />
      2 Now, thou son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyrus;<BR />
      3 And say unto Tyrus, O thou that art situate at the entry of
      the sea, which art a merchant of the people for many isles, Thus
      saith the Lord GOD; O Tyrus, thou hast said, I am of perfect
      beauty.<BR />
      4 Thy borders are in the midst of the seas, thy builders have
      perfected thy beauty.<BR />
      5 They have made all thy ship boards of fir trees of Senir: they
      have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee.<BR />
      26 Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind
      hath broken thee in the midst of the seas.<BR />

      and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise,
      and all thy men of war, that are in thee, and in all thy company
      which is in the midst of thee, shall fall into the midst of the
      seas in the day of thy ruin.<BR />
      28 The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.<BR />

      of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand
      upon the land;<BR />
      30 And shall cause their voice to be heard against thee, and
      shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads,
      they shall wallow themselves in the ashes:<BR />
      31 And they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and
      gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee with bitterness
      of heart and bitter wailing.<BR />
      32 And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for
      thee, and lament over thee, saying, What city is like Tyrus,
      like the destroyed in the midst of the sea?<BR />
      33 When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many
      people; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude
      of thy riches and of thy merchandise.<BR />
      34 In the time when thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths
      of the waters thy merchandise and all thy company in the midst
      of thee shall fall.<BR />
      35 All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee,
      and their kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be troubled
      in their countenance.<BR />
      36 The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee; thou shalt
      be a terror, and never shalt be any more.<BR />

      1 After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up
      to Jerusalem.<BR />
      2 Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which
      is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.<BR />
      3 In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind,
      halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.<BR />
      4 For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and
      troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling
      of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease
      he had.<BR />
      5 And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty
      and eight years.<BR />
      6 When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long
      time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?<BR />
      7 The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the
      water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming,
      another steppeth down before me.<BR />
      8 Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.<BR />
      9 And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed,
      and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.<BR />
      10 The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the
      sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.<BR />
      11 He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto
      me, Take up thy bed, and walk.<BR />
      12 Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee,
      Take up thy bed, and walk?<BR />
      13 And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had
      conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.<BR />
      14 Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him,
      Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing
      come unto thee.<BR />
      15 The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which
      had made him whole.<BR />

      1 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<BR />
      2 Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto
      them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the
      land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman:<BR />
      3 If when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the
      trumpet, and warn the people;<BR />
      4 Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh
      not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood
      shall be upon his own head.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor359220"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">5 He
      heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood
      shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his
      soul.<BR />
      6 But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet,
      and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take any
      person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but
      his blood will I require at the watchman's hand.<BR />
      7 So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the
      house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth,
      and warn them from me.<BR />
      8 When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely
      die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way,
      that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will
      I require at thine hand.<BR />
      9 Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from
      it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity;
      but thou hast delivered thy soul.<BR />

      John 5:16-29</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      16 And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to
      slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.<BR />
      17 But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I
      work.<BR />
      18 Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he
      not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his
      Father, making himself equal with God.<BR />
      19 Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I
      say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he
      seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also
      doeth the Son likewise.<BR />
      20 For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things
      that himself doeth: and he will show him greater works than these,
      that ye may marvel.<BR />
      21 For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them;
      even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.<BR />
      22 For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment
      unto the Son:<BR />
      23 That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the
      Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father
      which hath sent him.<BR />
      24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and
      believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall
      not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.<BR />
      25 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now
      is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and
      they that hear shall live.<BR />
      26 For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to
      the Son to have life in himself;<BR />
      27 And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because
      he is the Son of man.<BR />
      28 Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all
      that are in the graves shall hear his voice,<BR />
      29 And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection
      of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection
      of damnation.<BR />

      Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be
      upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live?<BR />
      11 Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure
      in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his
      way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will
      ye die, O house of Israel?<BR />
      12 Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy people,
      The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the
      day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked,
      he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his
      wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his
      righteousness in the day that he sinneth.<BR />
      13 When I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely live;
      if he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all
      his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity
      that he hath committed, he shall die for it.<BR />
      14 Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die;
      if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;<BR />
      15 If the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed,
      walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he
      shall surely live, he shall not die.<BR />
      16 None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned
      unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall

      that these may eat?<BR />
      6 And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he
      would do.<BR />
      7 Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not
      sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.<BR />
      8 One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith
      unto him,<BR />
      9 There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two
      small fishes: but what are they among so many?<BR />
      10 And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much
      grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five
      thousand.<BR />
      11 And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he
      distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that
      were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.<BR />
      12 When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather
      up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.<BR />
      13 Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets
      with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained
      over and above unto them that had eaten.<BR />
      14 Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus
      did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into
      the world.<BR />

      Better is little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure

      1 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<BR />
      2 Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy,
      and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto the shepherds;
      Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should
      not the shepherds feed the flocks?<BR />
      3 Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them
      that are fed: but ye feed not the flock.<BR />
      4 The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed
      that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was
      broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away,
      neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and
      with cruelty have ye ruled them.<BR />
      5 And they were scattered, because there is no shepherd: and
      they became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they were
      scattered.<BR />
      6 My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every
      high hill: yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the
      earth, and none did search or seek after them.<BR />
      7 Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;<BR />
      8 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely because my flock became
      a prey, and my flock became meat to every beast of the field,
      because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search
      for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my
      flock;<BR />
      9 Therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;<BR />
      10 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against the shepherds;
      and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to
      cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed
      themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth,
      that they may not be meat for them.<BR />

      15 When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take
      him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain
      himself alone.<BR />
      16 And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the
      sea,<BR />
      17 And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum.
      And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.<BR />
      18 And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.<BR />
      19 So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs,
      they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the
      ship: and they were afraid.<BR />
      20 But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.<BR />
      21 Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately
      the ship was at the land whither they went.<BR />
      22 The day following, when the people which stood on the other
      side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save
      that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus
      went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples
      were gone away alone;<BR />
      23 (Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the
      place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given
      thanks:)<BR />
      24 When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither
      his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum,
      seeking for Jesus.<BR />
      25 And when they had found him on the other side of the sea,
      they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?<BR />
      26 Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
      Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did
      eat of the loaves, and were filled.<BR />

      28 Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work
      the works of God?<BR />
      29 Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God,
      that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.<BR />

      Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.<BR />
      5 Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.<BR />
      6 Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication
      with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.<BR />
      7 And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall
      keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.<BR />
      8 Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things
      are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are
      pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of
      good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise,
      think on these things.<BR />
      9 Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and
      heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with
      you.<BR />
      10 But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your
      care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful,
      but ye lacked opportunity.<BR />
      11 Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in
      whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.<BR />
      12 I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every
      where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to
      be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.<BR />
      13 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.<BR />
      14 Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate
      with my affliction.<BR />
      15 Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the
      gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated
      with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.<BR />
      16 For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.<BR />
      17 Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound
      to your account.<BR />
      18 But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of
      Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of
      a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.<BR />
      19 But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches
      in glory by Christ Jesus.<BR />
      20 Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.<BR />
      21 Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are
      with me greet you.<BR />
      22 All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's
