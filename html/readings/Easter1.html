      Wisdom 2:23-3:9</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      23 For God created man to be immortal, and made him to be an
      image of his own eternity.<BR />
      24 Nevertheless through envy of the devil came death into the
      world: and they that do hold of his side do find it.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor2281732"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">1 But
      the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and there
      shall no torment touch them.<BR />
      2 In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die: and their departure
      is taken for misery,<BR />
      3 And their going from us to be utter destruction: but they are
      in peace.<BR />
      4 For though they be punished in the sight of men, yet is their
      hope full of immortality.<BR />
      5 And having been a little chastised, they shall be greatly rewarded:
      for God proved them, and found them worthy for himself.<BR />
      6 As gold in the furnace hath he tried them, and received them
      as a burnt offering.<BR />
      7 And in the time of their visitation they shall shine, and run
      to and fro like sparks among the stubble.<BR />
      8 They shall judge the nations, and have dominion over the people,
      and their Lord shall reign for ever.<BR />
      9 They that put their trust in him shall understand the truth:
      and such as be faithful in love shall abide with him: for grace
      and mercy is to his saints, and he hath care for his elect.<BR />

      1 Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated
      unto the gospel of God,<BR />
      2 (Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)<BR />
      3 Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of
      the seed of David according to the flesh;<BR />
      4 And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to
      the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:<BR />
      5 By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience
      to the faith among all nations, for his name:<BR />

      all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace

      8 First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that
      your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.<BR />
      9 For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel
      of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always
      in my prayers;<BR />
      10 Making request, if by any means now at length I might have
      a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.<BR />
      11 For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual
      gift, to the end ye may be established;<BR />
      12 That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the
      mutual faith both of you and me.<BR />

      14 Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice
      with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.<BR />
      15 The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine
      enemy: the king of Israel, even the LORD, is in the midst of
      thee: thou shalt not see evil any more.<BR />

      17 The LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save,
      he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love,
      he will joy over thee with singing.<BR />
      18 I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly,
      who are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burden.<BR />
      19 Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and
      I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven
      out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where
      they have been put to shame.<BR />
      20 At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that
      I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all
      people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your
      eyes, saith the LORD.<BR />

      Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week,
      when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for
      fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith
      unto them, Peace be unto you.<BR />
      20 And when he had so said, he showed unto them his hands and
      his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor1708311"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">21 Then
      said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath
      sent me, even so send I you.<BR />
      22 And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith
      unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:<BR />
      23 Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and
      whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained.<BR />
      24 But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with
      them when Jesus came.<BR />
      25 The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen
      the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands
      the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the
      nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor1709445"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">26 And
      after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas
      with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in
      the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.<BR />
      27 Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold
      my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side:
      and be not faithless, but believing.<BR />
      28 And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.<BR />
      29 Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou
      hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have
      believed.<BR />
      30 And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his
      disciples, which are not written in this book:<BR />
      31 But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is
      the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have
      life through his name.<BR />

      3 And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which
      ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength
      of hand the LORD brought you out from this place: there shall
      no leavened bread be eaten.<BR />

      Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to
      give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt
      keep this service in this month.<BR />
      6 Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh
      day shall be a feast to the LORD.<BR />
      7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall
      no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven
      seen with thee in all thy quarters.<BR />
      8 And thou shalt show thy son in that day, saying, This is done
      because of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth
      out of Egypt.<BR />
      9 And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for
      a memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD'S law may be in
      thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee
      out of Egypt.<BR />
      10 Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from
      year to year.<BR />
      11 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land
      of the Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers,

      13 And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb;
      and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck:

      15 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go,
      that the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both
      the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I
      sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males;

      1 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time

      2 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he
      hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;<BR />
      3 Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image
      of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power,
      when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right
      hand of the Majesty on high;<BR />

      obtained a more excellent name than they.<BR />

      unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son,

      6 And again, when he bringeth in the first begotten into the
      world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.<BR />
      7 And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits,
      and his ministers a flame of fire.<BR />
      8 But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and
      ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.<BR />
      9 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore
      God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness
      above thy fellows.<BR />
      10 And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation
      of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:<BR />
      11 They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall
      wax old as doth a garment;<BR />
      12 And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be
      changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.<BR />
      13 But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my
      right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?<BR />
      14 Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister
      for them who shall be heirs of salvation?<BR />

      although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people
      repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:<BR />
      18 But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness
      of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed
      out of the land of Egypt.<BR />
      19 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly
      sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you;
      and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.<BR />
      20 And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in
      Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.<BR />
      21 And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud,
      to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give

      Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things
      which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.<BR />
      2 For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression
      and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;<BR />
      3 How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which
      at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed
      unto us by them that heard him;<BR />
      4 God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders,
      and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according
      to his own will?<BR />
      5 For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world
      to come, whereof we speak.<BR />
      6 But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man,
      that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest
      him?<BR />
      7 Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst
      him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of
      thy hands:<BR />
      8 Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For
      in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that
      is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under
      him.<BR />

      14 As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according

      16 Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.<BR />

      And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the
      heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people,
      and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel
      go from serving us?<BR />
      6 And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:<BR />
      7 And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots
      of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.<BR />
      8 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and
      he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of
      Israel went out with an high hand.<BR />
      9 But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots
      of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them
      encamping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon.<BR />
      10 And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted
      up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them;
      and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out
      unto the LORD.<BR />
      11 And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in
      Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore
      hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?<BR />
      12 Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying,
      Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been
      better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die
      in the wilderness.<BR />
      13 And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still,
      and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will show to you
      today: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen today, ye shall see
      them again no more for ever.<BR />
      14 The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.<BR />
      19 And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel,
      removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went
      from before their face, and stood behind them:<BR />
      20 And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp
      of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave
      light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other
      all the night.<BR />
      21 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD
      caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night,
      and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.<BR />
      24 And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked
      unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and
      of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,<BR />
      25 And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily:
      so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel;
      for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians.<BR />
      26 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over
      the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon
      their chariots, and upon their horsemen.<BR />
      27 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea
      returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians
      fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the
      midst of the sea.<BR />
      28 And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the
      horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea
      after them; there remained not so much as one of them.<BR />
      30 Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the
      Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.<BR />

      3 For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch

      if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope
      firm unto the end.<BR />

      </FONT><A NAME="anchor43734"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">8 Harden
      not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation

      10 Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They
      do always err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.<BR />
      11 So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)<BR />
      12 Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart
      of unbelief, in departing from the living God.<BR />
      13 But exhort one another daily, while it is called Today; lest
      any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.<BR />
      14 For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning

      15 While it is said, Today if ye will hear his voice, harden
      not your hearts, as in the provocation.<BR />
      16 For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all
      that came out of Egypt by Moses.<BR />
      17 But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with

      Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain
      from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;<BR />
      12 Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that,
      whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your
      good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of
      visitation.<BR />
      13 Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's
      sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;<BR />
      14 Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the
      punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.<BR />
      15 For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put
      to silence the ignorance of foolish men:<BR />
      16 As free, and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness,
      but as the servants of God.<BR />
      17 Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the
      king.<BR />

      1 And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation
      of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which
      is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second
      month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.<BR />
      2 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured
      against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:<BR />
      3 And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we
      had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we
      sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full;
      for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this
      whole assembly with hunger.<BR />
      4 Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from
      heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain
      rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk
      in my law, or no.<BR />
      5 And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall
      prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much
      as they gather daily.<BR />
      6 And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At
      even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from
      the land of Egypt:<BR />
      7 And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD;
      for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what
      are we, that ye murmur against us?<BR />
      13 An in the morning the dew lay round about the host.<BR />
      14 And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face
      of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as

      Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering
      into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.<BR />
      2 For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them:
      but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with
      faith in them that heard it.<BR />
      3 For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said,
      As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest:
      although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.<BR />
      4 For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this

      5 And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.<BR />
      6 Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein,
      and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because
      of unbelief:<BR />
      7 Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, Today, after
      so long a time; as it is said, Today if ye will hear his voice,
      harden not your hearts.<BR />
      8 For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward
      have spoken of another day.<BR />
      9 There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.<BR />
      10 For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased
      from his own works, as God did from his.<BR />

      1 And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed
      from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to
      the commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and there
      was no water for the people to drink.<BR />
      2 Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us
      water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide
      ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?<BR />
      3 And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured
      against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought
      us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle
      with thirst?<BR />
      4 And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto
      this people? they be almost ready to stone me.<BR />
      5 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and
      take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith
      thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.<BR />
      6 Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb;
      and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out
      of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight
      of the elders of Israel.<BR />
      7 And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because
      of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted
      the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?<BR />

      14 Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed
      into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our
      profession.<BR />
      15 For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with
      the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted
      like as we are, yet without sin.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor1903269"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">16 Let
      us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may
      obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.<BR />
      1 For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for
      men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts
      and sacrifices for sins:<BR />
      2 Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are
      out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.<BR />
      3 And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for
      himself, to offer for sins.<BR />
      4 And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is
      called of God, as was Aaron.<BR />
      5 So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest;
      but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, today have I begotten
      thee.<BR />
      6 As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever
      after the order of Melchisedec.<BR />
      7 Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers
      and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that
      was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;<BR />
      8 Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things
      which he suffered;<BR />
      9 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation
      unto all them that obey him;<BR />
      10 Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.<BR />
      11 Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered,
      seeing ye are dull of hearing.<BR />
      12 For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need
      that one teach you again which be the first principles of the
      oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and
      not of strong meat.<BR />
      13 For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of
      righteousness: for he is a babe.<BR />
      14 But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even
      those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern
      both good and evil.<BR />
