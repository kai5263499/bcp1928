      30 Malice and wrath, even these are abominations; and the sinful
      man shall have them both.<BR />
      1 He that revengeth shall find vengeance from the Lord, and he
      will surely keep his sins [in remembrance.]<BR />
      2 Forgive thy neighbour the hurt that he hath done unto thee,
      so shall thy sins also be forgiven when thou prayest.<BR />
      3 One man beareth hatred against another, and doth he seek pardon
      from the Lord?<BR />
      4 He sheweth no mercy to a man, which is like himself: and doth
      he ask forgiveness of his own sins?<BR />
      5 If he that is but flesh nourish hatred, who will intreat for
      pardon of his sins?<BR />
      6 Remember thy end, and let enmity cease; [remember] corruption
      and death, and abide in the commandments.<BR />
      7 Remember the commandments, and bear no malice to thy neighbour:
      [remember] the covenant of the Highest, and wink at ignorance.<BR />

      Matthew 18:7-20</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      7 Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be
      that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor394560"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">8 Wherefore
      if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them
      from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed,
      rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting
      fire.<BR />
      9 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from
      thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye,
      rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.<BR />
      10 Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for
      I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold
      the face of my Father which is in heaven.<BR />
      11 For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.<BR />
      12 How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them
      be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth
      into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?<BR />
      13 And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth
      more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not
      astray.<BR />
      14 Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven,
      that one of these little ones should perish.<BR />
      15 Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and
      tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear
      thee, thou hast gained thy brother.<BR />
      16 But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two
      more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word
      may be established.<BR />
      17 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church:
      but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as
      an heathen man and a publican.<BR />
      18 Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall
      be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall
      be loosed in heaven.<BR />
      19 Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth
      as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for
      them of my Father which is in heaven.<BR />
      20 For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there
      am I in the midst of them.<BR />

      46 If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth
      not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy,
      so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy,
      far or near;<BR />

      if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were
      carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee
      in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have
      sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;<BR />
      48 And so return unto thee with all their heart, and with all
      their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away
      captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest
      unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the
      house which I have built for thy name:<BR />
      49 Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven
      thy dwellingplace, and maintain their cause,<BR />
      50 And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and
      all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against
      thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive,
      that they may have compassion on them:<BR />
      51 For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou
      broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace
      of iron:<BR />
      52 That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant,
      and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto
      them in all that they call for unto thee.<BR />
      53 For thou didst separate them from among all the people of
      the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand
      of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of
      Egypt, O Lord GOD.<BR />

      36 And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with
      him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.<BR />
      37 And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when
      she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought
      an alabaster box of ointment,<BR />
      38 And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash
      his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her
      head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.<BR />
      39 Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake
      within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would
      have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth
      him: for she is a sinner.<BR />
      40 And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat
      to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor402650"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">41 There
      was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five
      hundred pence, and the other fifty.<BR />
      42 And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them
      both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?<BR />
      43 Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave
      most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.<BR />
      44 And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou
      this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water
      for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped
      them with the hairs of her head.<BR />
      45 Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came
      in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.<BR />
      46 My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath
      anointed my feet with ointment.<BR />
      47 Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven;
      for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same
      loveth little.<BR />
      48 And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.<BR />
      49 And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves,
      Who is this that forgiveth sins also?<BR />
      50 And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in
      peace.<BR />

      6 In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria,
      and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah
      and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the
      Medes.<BR />
      7 For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against
      the LORD their God, which had brought them up out of the land
      of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had
      feared other gods,<BR />
      8 And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORD cast
      out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel,
      which they had made.<BR />
      12 For they served idols, whereof the LORD had said unto them,
      Ye shall not do this thing.<BR />
      13 Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah,
      by all the prophets, and by all the seers, saying, Turn ye from
      your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according
      to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent
      to you by my servants the prophets.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor408240"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">14 Notwithstanding
      they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the neck
      of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD their God.<BR />
      15 And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made
      with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against
      them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after
      the heathen that were round about them, concerning whom the LORD
      had charged them, that they should not do like them.<BR />
      16 And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God,
      and made them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove,
      and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.<BR />
      17 And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through
      the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves
      to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.<BR />
      18 Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed
      them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah
      only.<BR />

      6 If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful
      children not accused of riot or unruly.<BR />

      self-willed, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not

      things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.<BR />
      12 One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The
      Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.<BR />
      13 This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that
      they may be sound in the faith;<BR />
      14 Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men,

      15 Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are
      defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind

      3 Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baal-peor:

      and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which
      were before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols:<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor431283"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">12 Therefore
      thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I am bringing such
      evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it,
      both his ears shall tingle.<BR />
      13 And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and
      the plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as
      a man wipeth a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down.<BR />
      14 And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver
      them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a
      prey and a spoil to all their enemies;<BR />
      15 Because they have done that which was evil in my sight, and
      have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth
      out of Egypt, even unto this day.<BR />
      16 Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had
      filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin wherewith
      he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight
      of the LORD.<BR />
      17 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did,
      and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book
      of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?<BR />
      18 And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the
      garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his
      son reigned in his stead.<BR />

      2 That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith,

      3 The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh

      of good things;<BR />
      4 That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their

      their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.<BR />

      adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.<BR />

      12 Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we
      should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present

      of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;<BR />
      14 Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all

      3 And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah,
      that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam,
      the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying,<BR />
      4 Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver
      which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers
      of the door have gathered of the people:<BR />
      5 And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work,
      that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and let them
      give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the
      LORD, to repair the breaches of the house,<BR />
      6 Unto carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber
      and hewn stone to repair the house.<BR />
      7 Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money
      that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully.<BR />
      8 And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I
      have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And
      Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.<BR />
      9 And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king
      word again, and said, Thy servants have gathered the money that
      was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of
      them that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of
      the LORD.<BR />
      10 And Shaphan the scribe showed the king, saying, Hilkiah the

      13 Go ye, inquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and

      1 Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers,
      to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,<BR />
      2 To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, showing
      all meekness unto all men.<BR />
      3 For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient,
      deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice
      and envy, hateful, and hating one another.<BR />
      4 But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward
      man appeared,<BR />
      5 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according
      to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and

      32 For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee,
      since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from
      the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been
      any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like
      it?<BR />
      33 Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the
      midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?<BR />
      34 Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst
      of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders,
      and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm,
      and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God
      did for you in Egypt before your eyes?<BR />
      35 Unto thee it was shown, that thou mightest know that the LORD
      he is God; there is none else beside him.<BR />
      36 Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might
      instruct thee: and upon earth he showed thee his great fire;
      and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.<BR />
      37 And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their
      seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty

      than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for

      1 Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins,

      cometh; go ye out to meet him.<BR />

      8 And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for
      our lamps are gone out.<BR />

      1 And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders
      of Judah and of Jerusalem.<BR />
      2 And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the
      men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and
      the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small
      and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book
      of the covenant which was found in the house of the LORD.<BR />
      3 And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before
      the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments
      and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and
      all their soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were
      written in this book. And all the people stood to the covenant.<BR />
      4 And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests
      of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth
      out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made
      for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven:
      and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron,
      and carried the ashes of them unto Beth-el.<BR />
      11 And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given
      to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the
      chamber of Nathan-melech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs,
      and burned the chariots of the sun with fire.<BR />
      12 And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of
      Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which
      Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD,
      did the king beat down, and brake them down from thence, and
      cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.<BR />
      13 And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were
      on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the
      king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the
      Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and
      for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the
      king defile.<BR />
      14 And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves,
      and filled their places with the bones of men.<BR />
      21 And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover
      unto the LORD your God, as it is written in the book of this
      covenant.<BR />
      22 Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days
      of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the
      kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;<BR />
      23 But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, wherein this passover
      was holden to the LORD in Jerusalem.<BR />

      1 And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel,
      the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day,
      that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them.<BR />
      2 The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.<BR />
      3 The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with

      5 (I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to show you
      the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of the fire,

      6 I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of
      Egypt, from the house of bondage.<BR />
      7 Thou shalt have none other gods before me.<BR />
      8 Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness
      of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth
      beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth:<BR />
      9 Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them:
      for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity
      of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation
      of them that hate me,<BR />
      10 And showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and
      keep my commandments.<BR />
      11 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain:
      for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name
      in vain.<BR />
      12 Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath
      commanded thee.<BR />
      13 Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work:<BR />
      14 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in
      it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter,
      nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine
      ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy
      gates; that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well
      as thou.<BR />
      15 And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt,
      and that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty
      hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded
      thee to keep the sabbath day.<BR />
      16 Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath
      commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may
      go well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth
      thee.<BR />

      18 Neither shalt thou commit adultery.<BR />
      19 Neither shalt thou steal.<BR />
      20 Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.<BR />
      21 Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife, neither shalt
      thou covet thy neighbour's house, his field, or his manservant,

      14 For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far
      country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them
      his goods.<BR />
      15 And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to
      another one; to every man according to his several ability; and

      27 Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers,

      24 Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards,
      and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that
      were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah
      put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were
      written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house
      of the LORD.<BR />
      25 And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned
      to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with
      all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after
      him arose there any like him.<BR />
      26 Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of
      his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah,
      because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him
      withal.<BR />
      27 And the LORD said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight,
      as I have removed Israel, and will cast off this city Jerusalem
      which I have chosen, and the house of which I said, My name shall
      be there.<BR />
      28 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are
      they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
      Judah?<BR />
      29 In his days Pharaoh-nechoh king of Egypt went up against the
      king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went
      against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.<BR />
      30 And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo,
      and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre.
      And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and
      anointed him, and made him king in his father's stead.<BR />

      First Lesson<BR />
      Deuteronomy 5:22-33</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      22 These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount
      out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick
      darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote
      them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me.<BR />
      23 And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst
      of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that
      ye came near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and
      your elders;<BR />
      24 And ye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shown us his glory
      and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst
      of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth talk with man,
      and he liveth.<BR />
      25 Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will
      consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more,
      then we shall die.<BR />
      26 For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of
      the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have,
      and lived?<BR />
      27 Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say:
      and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak
      unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it.<BR />
      28 And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake
      unto me; and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of
      the words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they
      have well said all that they have spoken.<BR />
      29 O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear
      me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well
      with them, and with their children for ever!<BR />
      30 Go say to them, Get you into your tents again.<BR />
      31 But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto
      thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments,
      which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land
      which I give them to possess it.<BR />
      32 Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath
      commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to
      the left.<BR />
      33 Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath
      commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with
      you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall
      possess.<BR />

      Lesson<BR />
      Matthew 25:31-46</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      31 When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy
      angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:<BR />
      32 And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall
      separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep
      from the goats:<BR />
      33 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats
      on the left.<BR />
      34 Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come,
      ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you
      from the foundation of the world:<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor530496"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">35 For
      I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye
      gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:<BR />
      36 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I
      was in prison, and ye came unto me.<BR />
      37 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw
      we thee an hungered, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee
      drink?<BR />
      38 When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and
      clothed thee?<BR />
      39 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?<BR />
      40 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say
      unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of
      these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.<BR />
      41 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart
      from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil
      and his angels:<BR />
      42 For I was an hungered, and ye gave me no meat; I was thirsty,
      and ye gave me no drink:<BR />
      43 I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed
      me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.<BR />
      44 Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we
      thee an hungered, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick,
      or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?<BR />
      45 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you,
      Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did
      it not to me.<BR />
      46 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the
      righteous into life eternal.<BR />
