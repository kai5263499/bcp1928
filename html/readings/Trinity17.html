      15 Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for the LORD hath spoken.<BR />
      16 Give glory to the LORD your God, before he cause darkness,
      and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while
      ye look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make
      it gross darkness.<BR />
      17 But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places
      for your pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with
      tears, because the LORD'S flock is carried away captive.<BR />
      18 Say unto the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit
      down: for your principalities shall come down, even the crown
      of your glory.<BR />
      19 The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open
      them: Judah shall be carried away captive all of it, it shall
      be wholly carried away captive.<BR />
      20 Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north:
      where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock?<BR />
      21 What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee? for thou hast
      taught them to be captains, and as chief over thee: shall not
      sorrows take thee, as a woman in travail?<BR />

      Lesson<BR />
      Mark 10:35-45</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      35 And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying,
      Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we
      shall desire.<BR />
      36 And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for
      you?<BR />
      37 They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on
      thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.<BR />
      38 But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye
      drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism
      that I am baptized with?<BR />
      39 And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them,
      Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the
      baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:<BR />
      40 But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine
      to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.<BR />
      41 And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased
      with James and John.<BR />
      42 But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know
      that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise
      lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon
      them.<BR />
      43 But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great
      among you, shall be your minister:<BR />
      44 And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant
      of all.<BR />
      45 For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but
      to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.<BR />

      Malachi 2:1-10 </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you.<BR />
      2 If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to
      give glory unto my name, saith the LORD of hosts, I will even
      send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings: yea,
      I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay it to heart.<BR />
      3 Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your
      faces, even the dung of your solemn feasts; and one shall take
      you away with it.<BR />
      4 And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you,
      that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.<BR />
      5 My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them
      to him for the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before
      my name.<BR />
      6 The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found
      in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn
      many away from iniquity.<BR />
      7 For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should
      seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD
      of hosts.<BR />
      8 But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to
      stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith
      the LORD of hosts.<BR />
      9 Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before
      all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have
      been partial in the law.<BR />
      10 Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why
      do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning
      the covenant of our fathers?<BR />

      10 And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.<BR />
      11 And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity
      eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise
      lift up herself.<BR />
      12 And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto
      her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.<BR />
      13 And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made
      straight, and glorified God.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor952191"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">14 And
      the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because
      that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people,
      There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore
      come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.<BR />
      15 The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth
      not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from
      the stall, and lead him away to watering?<BR />
      16 And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom
      Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this
      bond on the sabbath day?<BR />
      17 And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were
      ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things
      that were done by him.<BR />

      1 And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem
      to make him king.<BR />
      2 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was
      yet in Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence
      of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)<BR />
      3 That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation
      of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,<BR />
      4 Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou
      the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which
      he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.<BR />
      5 And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come
      again to me. And the people departed.<BR />
      6 And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before
      Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise
      that I may answer this people?<BR />

      8 But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given
      him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with
      him, and which stood before him:<BR />
      9 And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer
      this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which

      unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall
      be thicker than my father's loins.<BR />

      1 After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.<BR />
      2 And Job spake, and said,<BR />
      3 Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which
      it was said, There is a man child conceived.<BR />
      4 Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above,

      5 Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud
      dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.<BR />
      6 As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be
      joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number
      of the months.<BR />
      7 Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.<BR />

      9 Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look

      10 Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor

      1 At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn;

      of corn, and to eat.<BR />
      2 But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold,

      4 How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the showbread,
      which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were
      with him, but only for the priests?<BR />
      5 Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days
      the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?<BR />

      12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third
      day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the
      third day.<BR />
      13 And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the
      old men's counsel that they gave him;<BR />
      14 And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying,
      My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke:
      my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise
      you with scorpions.<BR />
      15 Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the
      cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which
      the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son
      of Nebat.<BR />
      16 So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them,
      the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in
      David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your
      tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel
      departed unto their tents.<BR />
      17 But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities
      of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.<BR />
      18 Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute;
      and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore
      king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee
      to Jerusalem.<BR />
      19 So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.<BR />
      20 And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was
      come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation,
      and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed
      the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.<BR />

      15 But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and
      great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;<BR />
      16 And charged them that they should not make him known:<BR />
      17 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the
      prophet, saying,<BR />
      18 Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom
      my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he
      shall show judgment to the Gentiles.<BR />
      19 He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his

      21 And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.<BR />
      22 Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind,
      and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb
      both spake and saw.<BR />
      23 And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the
      son of David?<BR />
      24 But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth
      not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.<BR />
      25 And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom
      divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city
      or house divided against itself shall not stand:<BR />
      26 And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself;
      how shall then his kingdom stand?<BR />

      25 Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein;
      and went out from thence, and built Penuel.<BR />
      26 And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return
      to the house of David:<BR />
      27 If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD
      at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again
      unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall
      kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.<BR />
      28 Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold,
      and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem:
      behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land
      of Egypt.<BR />
      29 And he set the one in Beth-el, and the other put he in Dan.<BR />
      30 And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship
      before the one, even unto Dan.<BR />
      31 And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the
      lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.<BR />
      32 And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the
      fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah,
      and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Beth-el, sacrificing
      unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Beth-el the
      priests of the high places which he had made.<BR />
      33 So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Beth-el
      the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which
      he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the

      1 The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea
      side.<BR />
      2 And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that
      he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on
      the shore.<BR />
      3 And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold,
      a sower went forth to sow;<BR />
      4 And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the
      fowls came and devoured them up:<BR />
      5 Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth:
      and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of
      earth:<BR />
      6 And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they
      had no root, they withered away.<BR />
      7 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked
      them:<BR />
      8 But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some
      an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.<BR />
      9 Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.<BR />
      10 And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou
      unto them in parables?<BR />
      11 He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you
      to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it
      is not given.<BR />
      12 For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have
      more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken
      away even that he hath.<BR />
      13 Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing
      see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.<BR />
      14 And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith,
      By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing
      ye shall see, and shall not perceive:<BR />

      should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should
      understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should
      heal them.<BR />
      16 But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for
      they hear.<BR />
      17 For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous
      men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not
      seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not

      1 And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead,
      said unto Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom
      I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according
      to my word.<BR />
      2 And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,<BR />
      3 Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by
      the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.<BR />
      4 And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I
      have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.<BR />
      5 So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for
      he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.<BR />
      6 And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning,
      and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.<BR />
      7 And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up,
      because there had been no rain in the land.<BR />
      8 And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,<BR />
      9 Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and
      dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to
      sustain thee.<BR />
      10 So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the
      gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering
      of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee,
      a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.<BR />
      11 And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said,
      Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.<BR />

      dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.<BR />
      13 And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast
      said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto
      me, and after make for thee and for thy son.<BR />
      14 For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal

      Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
      that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly,
      and not after the tradition which he received of us.<BR />
      7 For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved
      not ourselves disorderly among you;<BR />
      8 Neither did we eat any man's bread for nought; but wrought
      with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable
      to any of you:<BR />
      9 Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an example
      unto you to follow us.<BR />
      10 For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that
      if any would not work, neither should he eat.<BR />
      11 For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly,
      working not at all, but are busybodies.<BR />
      12 Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus
      Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.<BR />
      13 But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.<BR />
      14 And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that
      man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.<BR />
      15 Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.<BR />
      16 Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all
      means. The Lord be with you all.<BR />
      17 The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token
      in every epistle: so I write.<BR />

      35 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet,
      saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things
      which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.<BR />
      44 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in
      a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for
      joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that
      field.<BR />
      45 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man,
      seeking goodly pearls:<BR />
      46 Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and
      sold all that he had, and bought it.<BR />
      47 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was
      cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:<BR />
      48 Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down,
      and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.<BR />
      49 So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come
      forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,<BR />
      50 And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall
      be wailing and gnashing of teeth.<BR />
      51 Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things?
      They say unto him, Yea, Lord.<BR />
