      John 11:21-44<BR />
      21 Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here,
      my brother had not died.<BR />
      22 But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God,
      God will give it thee.<BR />
      23 Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.<BR />
      24 Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in
      the resurrection at the last day.<BR />
      25 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life:
      he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:<BR />
      26 And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.
      Believest thou this?<BR />
      27 She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the
      Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.<BR />
      28 And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary
      her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth
      for thee.<BR />
      29 As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto
      him.<BR />
      30 Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that
      place where Martha met him.<BR />
      31 The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted
      her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out,
      followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.<BR />
      32 Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she
      fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been
      here, my brother had not died.<BR />
      33 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping
      which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,<BR />
      34 And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord,
      come and see.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor511375"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">35 Jesus
      wept.<BR />
      36 Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!<BR />
      37 And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the
      eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not
      have died?<BR />
      38 Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave.
      It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.<BR />
      39 Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of
      him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh:
      for he hath been dead four days.<BR />
      40 Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou
      wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?<BR />
      41 Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead
      was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank
      thee that thou hast heard me.<BR />
      42 And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the
      people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou
      hast sent me.<BR />
      43 And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus,
      come forth.<BR />
      44 And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with
      graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus
      saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.<BR />

      1 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<BR />
      2 Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto
      them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the
      land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman:<BR />
      3 If when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the
      trumpet, and warn the people;<BR />
      4 Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh
      not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood
      shall be upon his own head.<BR />
      5 He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his
      blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver
      his soul.<BR />
      6 But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet,
      and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take any
      person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but
      his blood will I require at the watchman's hand.<BR />
      7 So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the
      house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth,
      and warn them from me.<BR />

      1 Kings 8:1-11 </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads
      of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel,
      unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the
      ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which
      is Zion.<BR />
      2 And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon
      at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.<BR />
      3 And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up
      the ark.<BR />
      4 And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle
      of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the
      tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring
      up.<BR />
      5 And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that
      were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing
      sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.<BR />
      6 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD
      unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy
      place, even under the wings of the cherubims.<BR />
      7 For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place
      of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves
      thereof above.<BR />
      8 And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were
      seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not
      seen without: and there they are unto this day.<BR />
      9 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone,
      which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant
      with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of
      Egypt.<BR />
      10 And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the
      holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,<BR />

      18 While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came
      a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even
      now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.<BR />
      19 And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.<BR />
      20 And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of
      blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his

      21 For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment,
      I shall be whole.<BR />
      22 But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said,
      Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole.
      And the woman was made whole from that hour.<BR />
      23 And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels

      13 I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place
      for thee to abide in for ever.<BR />

      15 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spake
      with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled
      it, saying,<BR />
      16 Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of
      Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build
      an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to
      be over my people Israel.<BR />
      17 And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house
      for the name of the LORD God of Israel.<BR />
      18 And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in
      thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that
      it was in thine heart.<BR />
      19 Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that
      shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto
      my name.<BR />
      20 And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I
      am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne

      1 For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that
      it was not in vain:<BR />
      2 But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully
      entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to
      speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.<BR />
      3 For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness,
      nor in guile:<BR />
      4 But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel,
      even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth
      our hearts.<BR />
      5 For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know,
      nor a cloak of covetousness; God is witness:<BR />
      6 Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others,
      when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.<BR />
      7 But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her
      children:<BR />
      8 So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to
      have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also
      our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.<BR />
      9 For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring
      night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of
      you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.<BR />
      10 Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and
      unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:<BR />
      11 As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every
      one of you, as a father doth his children,<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor1275284"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">12 That
      ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom
      and glory.<BR />
      13 For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because,
      when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received
      it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of
      God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.<BR />

      22 And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence

      23 And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee,

      thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that
      thy children take heed to their way, that they walk before me
      as thou hast walked before me.<BR />

      and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this

      to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and
      to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee today:<BR />

      Job 1:1-12</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and
      that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and
      eschewed evil.<BR />
      2 And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.<BR />
      3 His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand
      camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses,
      and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest
      of all the men of the east.<BR />
      4 And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his
      day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to
      drink with them.<BR />
      5 And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about,
      that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning,
      and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all:
      for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed
      God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.<BR />
      6 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves
      before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.<BR />
      7 And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan
      answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth,
      and from walking up and down in it.<BR />
      8 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant
      Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and
      an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?<BR />
      9 Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for
      nought?<BR />
      10 Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house,
      and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the
      work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.<BR />
      11 But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath,
      and he will curse thee to thy face.<BR />
      12 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is
      in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So
      Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.<BR />

      13 And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating

      14 And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were

      sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped
      alone to tell thee.<BR />
      17 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said,
      The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels,

      2 Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ,
      he sent two of his disciples,<BR />

      5 The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers
      are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and

      1 Kings 11:26-31, 34-37<BR />
      26 And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's
      servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even
      he lifted up his hand against the king.<BR />
      27 And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against
      the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the

      28 And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon
      seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler
      over all the charge of the house of Joseph.<BR />
      29 And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of
      Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in
      the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they
      two were alone in the field:<BR />
      30 And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent
      it in twelve pieces:<BR />
      31 And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith
      the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom
      out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:<BR />
      34 Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand:
      but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David
      my servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments

      35 But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will

      1 Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present

      an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and

      5 But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh,
      and he will curse thee to thy face.<BR />
      6 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand;
      but save his life.<BR />
      7 So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote
      Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.<BR />
      8 And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he
      sat down among the ashes.<BR />
      9 Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity?
      curse God, and die.<BR />
      10 But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish
      women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God,
      and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with
      his lips.<BR />
      11 Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was
      come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz
      the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite:
      for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with
      him and to comfort him.<BR />
      12 And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him
      not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every
      one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.<BR />
      13 So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven
      nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his
      grief was very great.<BR />

      20 Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty
      works were done, because they repented not:<BR />
      21 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if
      the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre
      and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and
      ashes.<BR />
      22 But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and
      Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.<BR />
      23 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt
      be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have
      been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained
      until this day.<BR />
      24 But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the
      land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.<BR />
      25 At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father,
      Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things
      from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.<BR />
      26 Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.<BR />
      27 All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man
      knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the
      Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal
      him.<BR />
      28 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and
      I will give you rest.<BR />
      29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and
      lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.<BR />
      30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.<BR />
