      1 My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments
      with thee;<BR />
      2 So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine
      heart to understanding;<BR />
      3 Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice
      for understanding;<BR />
      4 If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for
      hid treasures;<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor308240"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">5 Then
      shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge
      of God.<BR />
      6 For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge
      and understanding.<BR />
      7 He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler
      to them that walk uprightly.<BR />
      8 He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of
      his saints.<BR />
      9 Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and
      equity; yea, every good path.<BR />

      Lesson<BR />
      1 Timothy 3:14-4:16 </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      14 These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor323068"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">15 But
      if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave
      thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living
      God, the pillar and ground of the truth.<BR />
      16 And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness:
      God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen
      of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world,
      received up into glory.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor324326"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">1 Now
      the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some
      shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits,
      and doctrines of devils;<BR />
      2 Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared
      with a hot iron;<BR />
      3 Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats,
      which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them
      which believe and know the truth.<BR />
      4 For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused,
      if it be received with thanksgiving:<BR />
      5 For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.<BR />
      6 If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou
      shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the
      words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor325367"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">7 But
      refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself rather
      unto godliness.<BR />
      8 For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable
      unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and
      of that which is to come.<BR />
      9 This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.<BR />
      10 For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because
      we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially
      of those that believe.<BR />
      11 These things command and teach.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor326733"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">12 Let
      no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers,
      in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in
      purity.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor328582"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">13 Till
      I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.<BR />
      14 Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee
      by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.<BR />
      15 Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that
      thy profiting may appear to all.<BR />
      16 Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in
      them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them
      that hear thee.<BR />

      Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)<BR />
      2 And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of
      Galatia:<BR />
      3 Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our
      Lord Jesus Christ,<BR />
      4 Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from
      this present evil world, according to the will of God and our

      5 To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.<BR />

      is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would

      8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel
      unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be
      accursed.<BR />
      9 As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any

      1 Kings 18:1-15</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD
      came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, show thyself unto
      Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.<BR />
      2 And Elijah went to show himself unto Ahab. And there was a
      sore famine in Samaria.<BR />
      3 And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house.
      (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:<BR />
      4 For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD,
      that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty
      in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)<BR />
      5 And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains
      of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass
      to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the
      beasts.<BR />
      6 So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it:
      Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by
      himself.<BR />
      7 And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and
      he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my
      lord Elijah?<BR />
      8 And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah
      is here.<BR />
      9 And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver
      thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?<BR />
      10 As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom,
      whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said,
      He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that
      they found thee not.<BR />
      11 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is
      here.<BR />
      12 And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee,
      that the spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not;
      and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he
      shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.<BR />
      13 Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets
      of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD'S prophets
      by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?<BR />
      14 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is
      here: and he shall slay me.<BR />
      15 And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom
      I stand, I will surely show myself unto him today.<BR />

      12 Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is

      </FONT><A NAME="anchor585791"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">13 Let

      lust, and enticed.<BR />
      15 Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and

      53 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables,
      he departed thence.<BR />
      54 And when he was come into his own country, he taught them
      in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said,
      Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?<BR />
      55 Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called
      Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?<BR />

      they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet
      is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own

      58 And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.<BR />
      1 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,<BR />
      2 And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is
      risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do show forth
      themselves in him.<BR />
      3 For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him

      6 But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias
      danced before them, and pleased Herod.<BR />
      7 Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she

      8 And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give
      me here John Baptist's head in a charger.<BR />
      9 And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and
      them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given
      her.<BR />
      10 And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.<BR />
      11 And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel:

      22 Then said Eliajah unto the people, I, even I only, remain

      your own selves.<BR />
      23 For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is

      1 Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble.<BR />
      2 He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also
      as a shadow, and continueth not.<BR />
      3 And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest
      me into judgment with thee?<BR />
      4 Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.<BR />
      5 Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are
      with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;<BR />
      6 Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish,
      as an hireling, his day.<BR />
      7 For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will
      sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.<BR />
      8 Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock
      thereof die in the ground;<BR />
      9 Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth
      boughs like a plant.<BR />
      10 But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost,
      and where is he?<BR />
      11 As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and
      drieth up:<BR />
      12 So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no
      more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.<BR />

      This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude

      25 And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one
      bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many;
      and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.<BR />
      26 And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed
      it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon,
      saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that
      answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.<BR />
      27 And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and
      said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he
      is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth,
      and must be awaked.<BR />
      28 And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner
      with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.<BR />
      29 And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied
      until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that
      there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.<BR />
      30 And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And
      all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar
      of the LORD that was broken down.<BR />
      36 And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening
      sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD
      God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day
      that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that
      I have done all these things at thy word.<BR />
      37 Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou
      art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back
      again.<BR />
      38 Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice,
      and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the
      water that was in the trench.<BR />
      39 And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces:
      and they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.<BR />
      40 And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let
      not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought
      them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.<BR />
      41 And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for
      there is a sound of abundance of rain.<BR />
      42 So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to
      the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and
      put his face between his knees,<BR />
      43 And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And
      he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said,
      Go again seven times.<BR />
      44 And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold,
      there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand.
      And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get
      thee down, that the rain stop thee not.<BR />
      45 And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was
      black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab
      rode, and went to Jezreel.<BR />
      46 And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his
      loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.<BR />

      1 My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
      Lord of glory, with respect of persons.<BR />
      2 For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring,
      in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile
      raiment;<BR />
      3 And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and
      say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor,
      Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:<BR />
      4 Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges
      of evil thoughts?<BR />
      5 Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor
      of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he
      hath promised to them that love him?<BR />
      6 But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you,
      and draw you before the judgment seats?<BR />
      7 Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are
      called?<BR />
      8 If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou
      shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:<BR />
      9 But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced
      of the law as transgressors.<BR />

      one point, he is guilty of all.<BR />

      1 Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem,
      saying,<BR />
      2 Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders?
      for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.<BR />
      3 But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress
      the commandment of God by your tradition?<BR />
      4 For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and,
      He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.<BR />
      5 But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother,
      It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;<BR />
      6 And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free.
      Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your
      tradition.<BR />
      7 Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor720278"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">8 This
      people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me
      with their lips; but their heart is far from me.<BR />
      9 But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the
      commandments of men.<BR />
      10 And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and
      understand:<BR />
      11 Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that
      which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.<BR />
      12 Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that
      the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?<BR />
      13 But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father
      hath not planted, shall be rooted up.<BR />
      14 Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if
      the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.<BR />
      15 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this
      parable.<BR />
      16 And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?<BR />
      17 Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the
      mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?<BR />
      18 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth
      from the heart; and they defile the man.<BR />
      19 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,
      fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:<BR />
      20 These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen
      hands defileth not a man.<BR />

      9 And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold,
      the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him, What
      doest thou here, Elijah?<BR />
      10 And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of
      hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant,

      And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind
      rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the
      LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind an

      after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire:

      13 And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face
      in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of
      the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said,
      What doest thou here, Elijah?<BR />
      14 And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of

      and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it

      15 And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness
      of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be king over
      Syria:<BR />
      16 And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over
      Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou
      anoint to be prophet in thy room.<BR />
      17 And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword

      19 So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat,
      who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with
      the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon
      him.<BR />
      20 And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let
      me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will
      follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have
      I done to thee?<BR />
      21 And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and
      slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the

      1 My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive
      the greater condemnation.<BR />
      2 For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in
      word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the
      whole body.<BR />
      3 Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey
      us; and we turn about their whole body.<BR />
      4 Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are
      driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very
      small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.<BR />
      5 Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things.
      Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!<BR />
      6 And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue
      among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth
      on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.<BR />
      7 For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and
      of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor736438"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">8 But
      the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly
      poison.<BR />
      9 Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse
      we men, which are made after the similitude of God.<BR />
      10 Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My
      brethren, these things ought not so to be.<BR />
      11 Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and
      bitter?<BR />
      12 Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either
      a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.<BR />
      13 Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let
      him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of
      wisdom.<BR />
      14 But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory
      not, and lie not against the truth.<BR />
      15 This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual,
      devilish.<BR />
      16 For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every
      evil work.<BR />
      17 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable,
      gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits,
      without partiality, and without hypocrisy.<BR />
      18 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that
      make peace.<BR />

      1 Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they
      that know him not see his days?<BR />
      2 Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks,
      and feed thereof.<BR />
      3 They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's
      ox for a pledge.<BR />
      4 They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide
      themselves together.<BR />
      12 Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded
      crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.<BR />
      13 They are of those that rebel against the light; they know
      not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.<BR />
      14 The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy,
      and in the night is as a thief.<BR />
      15 The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying,
      No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.<BR />
      16 In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked
      for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.<BR />
      17 For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if
      one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.<BR />

      21 Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre

      22 And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts,
      and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son
      of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.<BR />
      23 But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and
      besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.<BR />

      which fall from their masters' table.<BR />

      that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast

      31 Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb

      1 And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite
      had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab
      king of Samaria.<BR />
      2 And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that
      I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto
      my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than
      it; or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of
      it in money.<BR />
      3 And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should
      give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.<BR />
      4 And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of
      the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he
      had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers.
      And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face,
      and would eat no bread.<BR />
      5 But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is
      thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?<BR />
      6 And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite,
      and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if
      it please thee, I will give thee another vineyard for it: and
      he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.<BR />
      7 And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the
      kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart
      be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.<BR />
      8 So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his
      seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles
      that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.<BR />
      9 And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and
      set Naboth on high among the people:<BR />
      10 And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness
      against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And

      Lesson<BR />
      Matthew 16:1-12 </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired
      him that he would show them a sign from heaven.<BR />
      2 He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say,
      It will be fair weather: for the sky is red.<BR />
      3 And in the morning, It will be foul weather today: for the
      sky is red and lowering. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the
      face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?<BR />
      4 A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and
      there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet
      Jonas. And he left them, and departed.<BR />
      5 And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had
      forgotten to take bread.<BR />
      6 Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven
      of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.<BR />
      7 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we
      have taken no bread.<BR />
      8 Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little
      faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought
      no bread?<BR />
      9 Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves
      of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?<BR />
      10 Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many
      baskets ye took up?<BR />
      11 How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to
      you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of
      the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?<BR />
      12 Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the
      leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of
      the Sadducees.<BR />
