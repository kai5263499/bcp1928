      4 The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that
      I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary:
      he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear
      as the learned.<BR />
      5 The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious,
      neither turned away back.<BR />
      6 I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked
      off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.<BR />

      the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded:
      therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I
      shall not be ashamed.<BR />
      8 He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let
      us stand together: who is mine adversary? let him come near to
      me.<BR />
      9 Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who is he that shall condemn
      me? lo, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat

      1 It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come
      to visions and revelations of the Lord.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor320354"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">2 I knew
      a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body,
      I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God
      knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.<BR />
      3 And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the
      body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)<BR />
      4 How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable
      words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.<BR />
      5 Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory,
      but in mine infirmities.<BR />
      6 For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool;
      for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should
      think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth
      of me.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor322957"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">7 And
      lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance
      of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh,
      the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted
      above measure.<BR />
      8 For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart
      from me.<BR />
      9 And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my
      strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will
      I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may
      rest upon me.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor325204"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">10 Therefore
      I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities,
      in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I
      am weak, then am I strong.<BR />
      11 I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for
      I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind
      the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.<BR />
      12 Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all
      patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.<BR />

      32 But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not

      35 Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest?
      behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields;
      for they are white already to harvest.<BR />
      36 And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto

      1 And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into
      the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.<BR />
      7 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons'
      wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.<BR />
      8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls,
      and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,<BR />
      9 There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male
      and the female, as God had commanded Noah.<BR />
      10 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the
      flood were upon the earth.<BR />
      17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters
      increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the
      earth.<BR />
      18 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon
      the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.<BR />
      19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all
      the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.<BR />
      20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains
      were covered.<BR />
      21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl,
      and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that
      creepeth upon the earth, and every man:<BR />
      22 All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that
      was in the dry land, died.<BR />
      23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the
      face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things,
      and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the
      earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with
      him in the ark.<BR />

      24 And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre
      and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know
      it: but he could not be hid.<BR />
      25 For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit,
      heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:<BR />
      26 The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she
      besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.<BR />
      27 But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled:
      for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast
      it unto the dogs.<BR />
      28 And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs
      under the table eat of the children's crumbs.<BR />
      29 And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil
      is gone out of thy daughter.<BR />
      30 And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone
      out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.<BR />
      31 And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he
      came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts
      of Decapolis.<BR />
      32 And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment
      in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.<BR />
      33 And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers
      into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;<BR />
      34 And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha,
      that is, Be opened.<BR />
      35 And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his
      tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.<BR />
      36 And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the
      more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published
      it;<BR />
      37 And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all
      things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to
      speak.<BR />

      Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions,
      till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it
      was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.<BR />
      20 Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.<BR />
      21 Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for
      if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily
      righteousness should have been by the law.<BR />
      22 But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise
      by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.<BR />
      23 But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up
      unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.<BR />
      24 Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ,
      that we might be justified by faith.<BR />

      the window of the ark which he had made:<BR />
      7 And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until
      the waters were dried up from off the earth.<BR />
      8 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were
      abated from off the face of the ground;<BR />
      9 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she
      returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face
      of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her,
      and pulled her in unto him into the ark.<BR />
      10 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth
      the dove out of the ark;<BR />
      11 And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her
      mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters
      were abated from off the earth.<BR />
      12 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove;
      which returned not again unto him any more.<BR />
      13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in
      the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were
      dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of
      the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was
      dry.<BR />
      14 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of
      the month, was the earth dried.<BR />
      15 And God spake unto Noah, saying,<BR />
      16 Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and
      thy sons' wives with thee.<BR />

      wives with him:<BR />
      19 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever
      creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of
      the ark.<BR />
      20 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every
      clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings
      on the altar.<BR />
      21 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in
      his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's

      hath many more children than she which hath an husband.<BR />
      28 Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.<BR />
      29 But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him
      that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.<BR />
      30 Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman
      and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with
      the son of the freewoman.<BR />
      31 So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but
      of the free.<BR />

      27 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram,
      Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.<BR />
      28 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his
      nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.<BR />
      29 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife
      was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter
      of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.<BR />
      30 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.<BR />
      31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his
      son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife;
      and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go
      into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt
      there.<BR />
      32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and
      Terah died in Haran.<BR />

      the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and

      I will show thee:<BR />
      2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee,
      and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:<BR />
      3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth
      thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.<BR />
      4 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot
      went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when
      he departed out of Haran.<BR />
      5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and
      all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that
      they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the
      land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.<BR />
      6 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem,
      unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.<BR />
      7 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will
      I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD,
      who appeared unto him.<BR />
      8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth-el,
      and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Hai on

      upon the name of the LORD.<BR />

      19 He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long

      20 And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway

      foaming.<BR />
      21 And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came
      unto him? And he said, Of a child.<BR />
      22 And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the

      10 Then Amaziah the priest of Beth-el sent to Jeroboam king of
      Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst
      of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his
      words.<BR />
      11 For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and
      Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.<BR />
      12 Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away
      into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:<BR />
      13 But prophesy not again any more at Beth-el: for it is the
      king's chapel, and it is the king's court.<BR />
      14 Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet,
      neither was I a prophet's son; but I was an herdman, and a gatherer
      of sycamore fruit:<BR />
      15 And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD
      said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.<BR />
      16 Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest,
      Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the
      house of Isaac.<BR />
      17 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be an harlot
      in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the
      sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt
      die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity

      Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made
      us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.<BR />
      2 Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ
      shall profit you nothing.<BR />
      3 For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that
      he is a debtor to do the whole law.<BR />
      4 Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are
      justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.<BR />
      5 For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness
      by faith.<BR />
      6 For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing,
      nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.<BR />
      7 Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey
      the truth?<BR />
      8 This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.<BR />
      9 A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.<BR />

      2 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.<BR />
      5 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds,
      and tents.<BR />
      6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell
      together: for their substance was great, so that they could not
      dwell together.<BR />
      7 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle
      and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite
      dwelled then in the land.<BR />
      8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee,
      between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen;
      for we be brethren.<BR />
      9 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray
      thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go
      to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will
      go to the left.<BR />
      10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan,
      that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed
      Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the
      land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.<BR />
      11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed
      east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.<BR />
      12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the
      cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.<BR />
      13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD
      exceedingly.<BR />
      14 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated
      from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where
      thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:<BR />
      15 For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it,
      and to thy seed for ever.<BR />
      16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that
      if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed
      also be numbered.<BR />
      17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the
      breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.<BR />
      18 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain
      of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the
