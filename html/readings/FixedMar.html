      Genesis 3:1-15</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field
      which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea,
      hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?<BR />
      2 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit
      of the trees of the garden:<BR />
      3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden,
      God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch
      it, lest ye die.<BR />
      4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:<BR />
      5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your
      eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and
      evil.<BR />
      6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and
      that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to
      make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and
      gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.<BR />
      7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they
      were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves
      aprons.<BR />
      8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden
      in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves
      from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.<BR />
      9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where
      art thou?<BR />
      10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid,
      because I was naked; and I hid myself.<BR />
      11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou
      eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest
      not eat?<BR />
      12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me,
      she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.<BR />
      13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou
      hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I
      did eat.<BR />
      14 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast
      done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every
      beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt
      thou eat all the days of thy life:<BR />
      15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between
      thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt
      bruise his heel.<BR />

      Romans 5:12-21</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      12 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death
      by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:<BR />
      13 (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed
      when there is no law.<BR />
      14 Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them
      that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression,
      who is the figure of him that was to come.<BR />
      15 But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through
      the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God,
      and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath
      abounded unto many.<BR />
      16 And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for
      the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is
      of many offences unto justification.<BR />
      17 For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more
      they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness
      shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)<BR />
      18 Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all
      men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the
      free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor511000"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">19 For
      as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the
      obedience of one shall many be made righteous.<BR />
      20 Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But
      where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:<BR />
      21 That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign
      through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.<BR />

      Hebrews 2:5-18</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      5 For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world
      to come, whereof we speak.<BR />
      6 But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man,
      that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest
      him?<BR />
      7 Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst
      him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of
      thy hands:<BR />
      8 Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For
      in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that
      is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under
      him.<BR />
      9 But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels
      for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that
      he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.<BR />
      10 For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are
      all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain
      of their salvation perfect through sufferings.<BR />
      11 For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are
      all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,<BR />
      12 Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst
      of the church will I sing praise unto thee.<BR />
      13 And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I
      and the children which God hath given me.<BR />
      14 Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and
      blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through
      death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that
      is, the devil;<BR />
      15 And deliver them who through fear of death were all their
      lifetime subject to bondage.<BR />
      16 For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he
      took on him the seed of Abraham.<BR />
      17 Wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto
      his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest
      in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins
      of the people.<BR />

      1 John 4:7-14</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      7 Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every
      one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.<BR />
      8 He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.<BR />
      9 In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that
      God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might
      live through him.<BR />
      10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us,
      and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.<BR />
      11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.<BR />
      12 No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another,
      God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.<BR />
      13 Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because
      he hath given us of his Spirit.<BR />
      14 And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son
      to be the Saviour of the world.<BR />

      1 And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD,
      mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine
      enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.<BR />
      2 There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee:
      neither is there any rock like our God.<BR />
      3 Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out
      of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him
      actions are weighed.<BR />
      4 The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled
      are girded with strength.<BR />
      5 They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and
      they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven;
      and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.<BR />
      6 The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the
      grave, and bringeth up.<BR />
      7 The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and
      lifteth up.<BR />
      8 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the
      beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make
      them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth
      are the LORD'S, and he hath set the world upon them.<BR />
      9 He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be
      silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.<BR />
      10 The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out
      of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the
      ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king,
      and exalt the horn of his anointed.<BR />

      Matthew 1:18-23</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his
      mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together,
      she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.<BR />
      19 Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing
      to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily.<BR />
      20 But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of
      the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son
      of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that
      which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.<BR />
      21 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name
      JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.<BR />
      22 Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was
      spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,<BR />
      23 Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth
      a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted
      is, God with us.<BR />
