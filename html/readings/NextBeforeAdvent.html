      Jeremiah 4:23-31</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      23 I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void;
      and the heavens, and they had no light.<BR />
      24 I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the
      hills moved lightly.<BR />
      25 I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of
      the heavens were fled.<BR />
      26 I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and
      all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the
      LORD, and by his fierce anger.<BR />
      27 For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate;
      yet will I not make a full end.<BR />
      28 For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black:
      because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not repent,
      neither will I turn back from it.<BR />
      29 The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and
      bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks:
      every city shall be forsaken, and not a man dwell therein.<BR />
      30 And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou
      clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with
      ornaments of gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting,
      in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; thy lovers will despise
      thee, they will seek thy life.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor1320535"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">31 For
      I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the anguish
      as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the
      daughter of Zion, that bewaileth herself, that spreadeth her
      hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul is wearied because
      of murderers.<BR />

      31 When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy
      angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:<BR />
      32 And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall
      separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep
      from the goats:<BR />

      he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the
      left.<BR />
      34 Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come,
      ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you
      from the foundation of the world:<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor1327661"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">35 For
      I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye
      gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:<BR />
      36 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I
      was in prison, and ye came unto me.<BR />
      37 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw
      we thee an hungered, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee
      drink?<BR />
      38 When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and
      clothed thee?<BR />
      39 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?<BR />
      40 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say
      unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of
      these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.<BR />
      41 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart
      from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil
      and his angels:<BR />
      42 For I was an hungered, and ye gave me no meat; I was thirsty,
      and ye gave me no drink:<BR />
      43 I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed
      me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.<BR />
      44 Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we
      thee an hungered, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick,
      or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?<BR />
      45 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you,
      Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did
      it not to me.<BR />
      46 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the
      righteous into life eternal.<BR />

      Ecclesiastes 11:9-12:8, 13-14</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      9 Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer
      thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine
      heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for
      all these things God will bring thee into judgment.<BR />
      10 Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil
      from thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.<BR />
      1 Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the
      evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt
      say, I have no pleasure in them;<BR />
      2 While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be
      not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain:<BR />
      3 In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and
      the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because
      they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened,<BR />
      4 And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound
      of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of
      the bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low;<BR />
      5 Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears
      shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and
      the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because
      man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets:<BR />
      6 Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken,
      or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken
      at the cistern.<BR />
      7 Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the
      spirit shall return unto God who gave it.<BR />
      8 Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.<BR />
      13 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God,
      and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor1775576"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">14 For
      God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing,
      whether it be good, or whether it be evil.<BR />

      Hebrews 13:1-21</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Let brotherly love continue.<BR />
      2 Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have
      entertained angels unawares.<BR />
      3 Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them
      which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor1804053"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">4 Marriage
      is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers
      and adulterers God will judge.<BR />
      5 Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content
      with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave
      thee, nor forsake thee.<BR />
      6 So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will
      not fear what man shall do unto me.<BR />
      7 Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken
      unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the
      end of their conversation.<BR />
      8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today, and for ever.<BR />
      9 Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For
      it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace;
      not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied
      therein.<BR />
      10 We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which
      serve the tabernacle.<BR />
      11 For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into
      the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without
      the camp.<BR />
      12 Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with
      his own blood, suffered without the gate.<BR />
      13 Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing
      his reproach.<BR />
      14 For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.<BR />
      15 By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God
      continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to
      his name.<BR />
      16 But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such
      sacrifices God is well pleased.<BR />
      17 Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves:
      for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account,
      that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is
      unprofitable for you.<BR />
      18 Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all
      things willing to live honestly.<BR />
      19 But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored
      to you the sooner.<BR />
      20 Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our
      Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood
      of the everlasting covenant,<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor1802003"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">21 Make

      20 The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers

      of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:<BR />
      2 Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge
      of God, and of Jesus our Lord,<BR />
      3 According as his divine power hath given unto us all things
      that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of
      him that hath called us to glory and virtue:<BR />
      4 Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises:
      that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having
      escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.<BR />

      7 And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness

      12 Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance
      of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the
      present truth.<BR />
      13 Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle,

      15 Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease
      to have these things always in remembrance.<BR />

      made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,
      but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.<BR />

      there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This
      is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.<BR />
      18 And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were
      with him in the holy mount.<BR />
      19 We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do
      well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark

      9 I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation,

      of Jesus Christ.<BR />
      10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me

      turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;<BR />
      13 And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the
      Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt
      about the paps with a golden girdle.<BR />
      14 His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow;
      and his eyes were as a flame of fire;<BR />
      15 And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a
      furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.<BR />
      16 And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth
      went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun
      shineth in his strength.<BR />
      17 And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid
      his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first
      and the last:<BR />
      18 I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive
      for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.<BR />

      a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth
      it.<BR />

      1 This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both
      which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:<BR />
      2 That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before
      by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles
      of the Lord and Saviour:<BR />
      3 Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days
      scoffers, walking after their own lusts,<BR />
      4 And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the
      fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the
      beginning of the creation.<BR />
      5 For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of
      God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the
      water and in the water:<BR />
      6 Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water,
      perished:<BR />
      7 But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word
      are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment
      and perdition of ungodly men.<BR />
      8 But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day
      is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as
      one day.<BR />
      9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count
      slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that
      any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.<BR />
      10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night;
      in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise,
      and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also
      and the works that are therein shall be burned up.<BR />

      to condemn him that hath not deserved to be punished.<BR />

      1 Surely vain are all men by nature, who are ignorant of God,
      and could not out of the good things that are seen know him that
      is: neither by considering the works did they acknowledge the
      workmaster;<BR />
      2 But deemed either fire, or wind, or the swift air, or the circle
      of the stars, or the violent water, or the lights of heaven,
      to be the gods which govern the world.<BR />
      3 With whose beauty if they being delighted took them to be gods;
      let them know how much better the Lord of them is: for the first
      author of beauty hath created them.<BR />
      4 But if they were astonished at their power and virtue, let
      them understand by them, how much mightier he is that made them.<BR />
      5 For by the greatness and beauty of the creatures proportionably
      the maker of them is seen.<BR />
      6 But yet for this they are the less to be blamed: for they peradventure
      err, seeking God, and desirous to find him.<BR />
