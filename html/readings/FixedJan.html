      He that giveth his mind to the law of the most High, and is occupied
      in the meditation thereof, will seek out the wisdom of all the
      ancient, and be occupied in prophecies.<BR />
      2 He will keep the sayings of the renowned men: and where subtil
      parables are, he will be there also.<BR />
      3 He will seek out the secrets of grave sentences, and be conversant
      in dark parables.<BR />
      4 He shall serve among great men, and appear before princes:
      he will travel through strange countries; for he hath tried the
      good and the evil among men.<BR />
      5 He will give his heart to resort early to the Lord that made
      him, and will pray before the most High, and will open his mouth
      in prayer, and make supplication for his sins.<BR />
      6 When the great Lord will, he shall be filled with the spirit
      of understanding: he shall pour out wise sentences, and give
      thanks unto the Lord in his prayer.<BR />
      7 He shall direct his counsel and knowledge, and in his secrets
      shall he meditate.<BR />
      8 He shall shew forth that which he hath learned, and shall glory
      in the law of the covenant of the Lord.<BR />
      9 Many shall commend his understanding; and so long as the world
      endureth, it shall not be blotted out; his memorial shall not
      depart away, and his name shall live from generation to generation.<BR />
      10 Nations shall shew forth his wisdom, and the congregation
      shall declare his praise.<BR />

      Galatians 1:1-5, 11-24</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus
      Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)<BR />
      2 And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of
      Galatia:<BR />
      3 Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our
      Lord Jesus Christ,<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor88586"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">4 Who
      gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this
      present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:<BR />
      5 To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.<BR />
      11 But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached
      of me is not after man.<BR />
      12 For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it,
      but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.<BR />
      13 For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews'
      religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of
      God, and wasted it:<BR />
      14 And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in
      mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions
      of my fathers.<BR />
      15 But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's
      womb, and called me by his grace,<BR />
      16 To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the
      heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:<BR />
      17 Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles
      before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.<BR />
      18 Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter,
      and abode with him fifteen days.<BR />
      19 But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's
      brother.<BR />
      20 Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God,
      I lie not.<BR />
      21 Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria, and Cilicia;<BR />
      22 And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which
      were in Christ:<BR />
      23 But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times
      past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.<BR />
      24 And they glorified God in me.<BR />

      Acts 22:1-21</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make
      now unto you.<BR />
      2 (And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to
      them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)<BR />
      3 I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in
      Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel,
      and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the
      fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.<BR />
      4 And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering
      into prisons both men and women.<BR />
      5 As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate
      of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren,
      and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto
      Jerusalem, for to be punished.<BR />
      6 And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come
      nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven
      a great light round about me.<BR />
      7 And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me,
      Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?<BR />
      8 And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I
      am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.<BR />
      9 And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid;
      but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.<BR />
      10 And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto
      me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee
      of all things which are appointed for thee to do.<BR />
      11 And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being
      led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.<BR />
      12 And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having
      a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there,<BR />
      13 Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive
      thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.<BR />
      14 And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that
      thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest
      hear the voice of his mouth.<BR />
      15 For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast
      seen and heard.<BR />
      16 And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash
      away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.<BR />
      17 And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem,
      even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;<BR />
      18 And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly
      out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning
      me.<BR />
      19 And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in
      every synagogue them that believed on thee:<BR />
      20 And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also
      was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the
      raiment of them that slew him.<BR />
      21 And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence
      unto the Gentiles.<BR />

      18 For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself
      that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he
      created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the
      LORD; and there is none else.<BR />
      19 I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth:
      I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the
      LORD speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.<BR />
      20 Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that
      are escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up
      the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot
      save.<BR />
      21 Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together:
      who hath declared this from ancient time? who hath told it from
      that time? have not I the LORD? and there is no God else beside
      me; a just God and a Saviour; there is none beside me.<BR />

      1 It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come
      to visions and revelations of the Lord.<BR />
      2 I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in
      the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot
      tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.<BR />
      3 And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the
      body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)<BR />
      4 How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable
      words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.<BR />
      5 Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory,
      but in mine infirmities.<BR />
      6 For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool;
      for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should
      think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth
      of me.<BR />
      7 And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance
      of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh,
      the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted
      above measure.<BR />
      8 For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart
      from me.<BR />

      4 Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<BR />
      5 Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou
      camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained
      thee a prophet unto the nations.<BR />
      6 Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am
      a child.<BR />
      7 But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou
      shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command
      thee thou shalt speak.<BR />
      8 Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver
      thee, saith the LORD.<BR />
      9 Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And
      the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.<BR />
      10 See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the
      kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and
      to throw down, to build, and to plant.<BR />

      10 Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints
      did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief
      priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against
      them.<BR />
      11 And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled
      them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I
      persecuted them even unto strange cities.<BR />
      12 Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission
      from the chief priests,<BR />
      13 At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above
      the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which
      journeyed with me.<BR />
      14 And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice
      speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul,
      why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against
      the pricks.<BR />
      15 And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom
      thou persecutest.<BR />
      16 But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto
      thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness
      both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things
      in the which I will appear unto thee;<BR />
      17 Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto
      whom now I send thee,<BR />
      18 To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light,
      and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness
      of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith
      that is in me.<BR />
      19 Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the
      heavenly vision:<BR />
      20 But showed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem,
      and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles,
      that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for
      repentance.<BR />
      21 For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went
      about to kill me.<BR />
      22 Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this
      day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things
      than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:<BR />
      23 That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first
      that should rise from the dead, and should show light unto the
      people, and to the Gentiles.<BR />
