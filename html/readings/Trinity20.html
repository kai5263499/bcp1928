      14 Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the LORD hath been witness
      between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast
      dealt treacherously: yet is she thy companion, and the wife of
      thy covenant.<BR />
      15 And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit.
      And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore
      take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against
      the wife of his youth.<BR />
      16 For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting
      away: for one covereth violence with his garment, saith the LORD
      of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not
      treacherously.<BR />

      is the God of judgment?<BR />

      3 The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying
      unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every
      cause?<BR />
      4 And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that
      he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,<BR />
      5 And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother,
      and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?<BR />
      6 Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore
      God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.<BR />
      7 They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing
      of divorcement, and to put her away?<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor547539"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">8 He
      saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts

      31 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a
      new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of
      Judah:<BR />
      32 Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers
      in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of
      the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was
      an husband unto them, saith the LORD:<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor554318"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">33 But
      this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of
      Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in
      their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be
      their God, and they shall be my people.<BR />
      34 And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and
      every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall
      all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them,
      saith the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will
      remember their sin no more.<BR />
      35 Thus saith the LORD, which giveth the sun for a light by day,
      and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by
      night, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The
      LORD of hosts is his name:<BR />
      36 If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the LORD,
      then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation
      before me for ever.<BR />
      37 Thus saith the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and
      the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also
      cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done,
      saith the LORD.<BR />

      8 And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was
      a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it
      was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat
      bread.<BR />
      9 And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that
      this is an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually.<BR />
      10 Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and
      let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and
      a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he
      shall turn in thither.<BR />
      11 And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned
      into the chamber, and lay there.<BR />
      12 And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And
      when he had called her, she stood before him.<BR />
      13 And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast
      been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for
      thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain
      of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people.<BR />
      14 And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered,
      Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.<BR />
      15 And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood
      in the door.<BR />
      16 And he said, About this season, according to the time of life,
      thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man
      of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid.<BR />
      17 And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that
      Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life.<BR />

      4 One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh:

      is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.<BR />

      which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new
      thing under the sun.<BR />
      10 Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new?
      it hath been already of old time, which was before us.<BR />

      16 And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what
      good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?<BR />
      17 And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none
      good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life,
      keep the commandments.<BR />
      18 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder,
      Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt
      not bear false witness,<BR />
      19 Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy

      22 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful:

      23 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you,
      That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.<BR />
      24 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through
      the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom
      of God.<BR />

      28 And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which
      have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall
      sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve
      thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.<BR />
      29 And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters,

      4 I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:<BR />
      5 I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them
      of all kind of fruits:<BR />
      6 I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that
      bringeth forth trees:<BR />
      7 I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my
      house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle
      above all that were in Jerusalem before me:<BR />
      8 I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure
      of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women
      singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments,
      and that of all sorts.<BR />
      9 So I was great, and increased more than all that were before
      me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.<BR />
      10 And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld
      not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour:
      and this was my portion of all my labour.<BR />
      11 Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought,
      and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all
      was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under
      the sun.<BR />

      1 For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder,
      which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his
      vineyard.<BR />
      2 And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day,
      he sent them into his vineyard.<BR />
      3 And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing
      idle in the marketplace,<BR />
      4 And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever
      is right I will give you. And they went their way.<BR />
      5 Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.<BR />
      6 And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing
      idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?<BR />
      7 They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto
      them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right,
      that shall ye receive.<BR />
      8 So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto
      his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning
      from the last unto the first.<BR />
      9 And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour,
      they received every man a penny.<BR />
      10 But when the first came, they supposed that they should have
      received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor780765"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">11 And
      when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman
      of the house,<BR />
      12 Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast
      made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat
      of the day.<BR />
      13 But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no
      wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?<BR />
      14 Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this
      last, even as unto thee.<BR />
      15 Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is
      thine eye evil, because I am good?<BR />
      16 So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be
      called, but few chosen.<BR />

      25 It came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that
      he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite:<BR />
      26 Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it
      well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with
      the child? And she answered, It is well.<BR />
      27 And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught
      him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And
      the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within
      her: and the LORD hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.<BR />
      28 Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say,
      Do not deceive me?<BR />
      29 Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff
      in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him
      not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my
      staff upon the face of the child.<BR />
      30 And the mother of the child said, As the LORD liveth, and
      as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and
      followed her.<BR />
      31 And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon
      the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing.
      Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The
      child is not awaked.<BR />
      32 And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child
      was dead, and laid upon his bed.<BR />
      33 He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and
      prayed unto the LORD.<BR />
      34 And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth
      upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon
      his hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh
      of the child waxed warm.<BR />

      he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up,

      and the child opened his eyes.<BR />
      36 And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he
      called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take
      up thy son.<BR />
      37 Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself
      to the ground, and took up her son, and went out.<BR />

      1 Rebuke not an elder, but entreat him as a father; and the younger
      men as brethren;<BR />
      2 The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all
      purity.<BR />
      3 Honour widows that are widows indeed.<BR />
      4 But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first
      to show piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that
      is good and acceptable before God.<BR />
      5 Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God,
      and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.<BR />
      6 But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.<BR />
      7 And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.<BR />
      8 But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those
      of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than
      an infidel.<BR />
      9 Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years
      old, having been the wife of one man,<BR />
      10 Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children,
      if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints'
      feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently
      followed every good work.<BR />
      11 But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to
      wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;<BR />
      12 Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith.<BR />
      13 And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house
      to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies,
      speaking things which they ought not.<BR />
      14 I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children,
      guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak
      reproachfully.<BR />
      15 For some are already turned aside after Satan.<BR />
      16 If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve
      them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve
      them that are widows indeed.<BR />

      20 Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all

      21 For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge,

      LORD had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man
      in valour, but he was a leper.<BR />
      2 And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought
      away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she
      waited on Naaman's wife.<BR />
      3 And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with

      leprosy.<BR />
      4 And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said
      the maid that is of the land of Israel.<BR />
      5 And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter
      unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten
      talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes
      of raiment.<BR />
      6 And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now
      when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith

      of his leprosy.<BR />
      7 And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter,
      that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to

      others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in
      the way.<BR />
      9 And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried,
      saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh
      in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.<BR />
      10 And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved,
      saying, Who is this?<BR />
      11 And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth
      of Galilee.<BR />
      12 And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them
      that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables
      of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,<BR />
      13 And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called
      the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.<BR />
      14 And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and
      he healed them.<BR />
      15 And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things
      that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying,
      Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore displeased,<BR />
      16 And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus
      saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of
      babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?<BR />

      9 So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood
      at the door of the house of Elisha.<BR />
      10 And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash
      in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee,
      and thou shalt be clean.<BR />
      11 But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought,
      He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name
      of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and
      recover the leper.<BR />
      12 Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than
      all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean?
      So he turned and went away in a rage.<BR />
      13 And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said,
      My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest
      thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to
      thee, Wash, and be clean?<BR />
      14 Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan,
      according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came
      again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.<BR />
      15 And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company,
      and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know
      that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore,
      I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant.<BR />
      16 But he said, As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will
      receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.<BR />
      17 And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given
      to thy servant two mules' burden of earth? for thy servant will
      henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other
      gods, but unto the LORD.<BR />
      18 In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, that when my master
      goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth
      on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow
      down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant
      in this thing.<BR />
      19 And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him
      a little way.<BR />

      1 Timothy 6:1-11 </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own
      masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine
      be not blasphemed.<BR />
      2 And they that have believing masters, let them not despise
      them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service,
      because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit.
      These things teach and exhort.<BR />
      3 If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words,
      even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine
      which is according to godliness;<BR />
      4 He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and
      strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil
      surmisings,<BR />
      5 Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute
      of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw
      thyself.<BR />
      6 But godliness with contentment is great gain.<BR />
      7 For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we
      can carry nothing out.<BR />
      8 And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.<BR />
      9 But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare,
      and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction
      and perdition.<BR />
      10 For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while
      some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced
      themselves through with many sorrows.<BR />

      16 And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that
      wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity
      was there.<BR />
      17 I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the
      wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every
      work.<BR />
      18 I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of
      men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that
      they themselves are beasts.<BR />
      19 For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts;
      even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the
      other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence
      above a beast: for all is vanity.<BR />
      20 All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to
      dust again.<BR />
      21 Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit
      of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?<BR />
      22 Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that
      a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion:
      for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?<BR />

      17 And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and
      he lodged there.<BR />
      18 Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.<BR />
      19 And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and
      found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let
      no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the
      fig tree withered away.<BR />
      20 And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How
      soon is the fig tree withered away!<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor1164965"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">21 Jesus
      answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have
      faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done
      to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain,
      Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.<BR />
      22 And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing,
      ye shall receive.<BR />
      23 And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and
      the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and
      said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave
      thee this authority?<BR />
      24 And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you
      one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you
      by what authority I do these things.<BR />
      25 The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men?
      And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From
      heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?<BR />
      26 But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold
      John as a prophet.<BR />
      27 And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he
      said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these
      things.<BR />
      28 But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came
      to the first, and said, Son, go work today in my vineyard.<BR />
      29 He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented,
      and went.<BR />
      30 And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered
      and said, I go, sir: and went not.<BR />
      31 Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say
      unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto
      you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of
      God before you.<BR />
      32 For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye
      believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed
      him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that
      ye might believe him.<BR />

      20 But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold,
      my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at
      his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD liveth, I will
      run after him, and take somewhat of him.<BR />
      21 So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running
      after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and
      said, Is all well?<BR />
      22 And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying,
      Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young
      men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent
      of silver, and two changes of garments.<BR />
      23 And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged
      him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes
      of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they
      bare them before him.<BR />
      24 And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand,
      and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they
      departed.<BR />
      25 But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said
      unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant
      went no whither.<BR />
      26 And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when
      the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time
      to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and
      vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?<BR />
      27 The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and

      Matthew 21:33-46</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      33 Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which
      planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress
      in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went
      into a far country:<BR />
      34 And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants
      to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.<BR />
      35 And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed
      another, and stoned another.<BR />
      36 Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they
      did unto them likewise.<BR />
      37 But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will
      reverence my son.<BR />
      38 But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves,
      This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on
      his inheritance.<BR />
      39 And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and
      slew him.<BR />
      40 When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will
      he do unto those husbandmen?<BR />
      41 They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked
      men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which
      shall render him the fruits in their seasons.<BR />
      42 Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures,
      The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the
      head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous
      in our eyes?<BR />
      43 Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken
      from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.<BR />
      44 And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but
      on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.<BR />
      45 And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables,
      they perceived that he spake of them.<BR />
      46 But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the
      multitude, because they took him for a prophet.<BR />
