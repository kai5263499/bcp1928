      16 And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim,
      hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.<BR />
      17 And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba
      the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his
      twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the
      king.<BR />
      18 And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's
      household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son
      of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;<BR />
      19 And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto
      me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely
      the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the
      king should take it to his heart.<BR />
      20 For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold,
      I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go
      down to meet my lord the king.<BR />
      21 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not
      Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD'S
      anointed?<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor283220"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">22 And
      David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that

      be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I
      am this day king over Israel?<BR />
      23 Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And
      the king sware unto him.<BR />

      Lesson<BR />
      Matthew 5:38-48</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      38 Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and
      a tooth for a tooth:<BR />
      39 But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever
      shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.<BR />
      40 And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy
      coat, let him have thy cloak also.<BR />
      41 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him
      twain.<BR />
      42 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow
      of thee turn not thou away.<BR />
      43 Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy
      neighbour, and hate thine enemy.<BR />
      44 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse
      you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully
      use you, and persecute you;<BR />
      45 That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven:
      for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and
      sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.<BR />
      46 For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do
      not even the publicans the same?<BR />
      47 And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than
      others? do not even the publicans so?<BR />
      48 Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven
      is perfect.<BR />

      Lesson<BR />
      Exodus 24:1-11, 16-18 </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 And He said unto Moses, Come up unto the LORD, thou, and Aaron,
      Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship
      ye afar off.<BR />
      2 And Moses alone shall come near the LORD: but they shall not
      come nigh; neither shall the people go up with him.<BR />
      3 And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD,
      and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice,
      and said, All the words which the LORD hath said will we do.<BR />
      4 And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early
      in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve
      pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.<BR />
      5 And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered
      burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto
      the LORD.<BR />
      6 And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basins; and
      half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.<BR />
      7 And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience
      of the people: and they said, All that the LORD hath said will
      we do, and be obedient.<BR />
      8 And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and
      said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made
      with you concerning all these words.<BR />
      9 Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy
      of the elders of Israel:<BR />
      10 And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet
      as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the
      body of heaven in his clearness.<BR />
      11 And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not
      his hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink.<BR />
      16 And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the
      cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto
      Moses out of the midst of the cloud.<BR />
      17 And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring
      fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.<BR />
      18 And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up
      into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty
      nights.<BR />

      Lesson<BR />
      Hebrews 9:18-28 </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      18 Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without
      blood.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor355970"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">19 For
      when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according
      to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water,
      and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and
      all the people,<BR />
      20 Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath
      enjoined unto you.<BR />
      21 Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and
      all the vessels of the ministry.<BR />
      22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and
      without shedding of blood is no remission.<BR />
      23 It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in
      the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things
      themselves with better sacrifices than these.<BR />
      24 For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands,
      which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now
      to appear in the presence of God for us:<BR />
      25 Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest
      entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;<BR />
      26 For then must he often have suffered since the foundation
      of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared
      to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.<BR />
      27 And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this
      the judgment:<BR />
      28 So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto
      them that look for him shall he appear the second time without
      sin unto salvation.<BR />

      12 And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD,
      that Eli marked her mouth.<BR />
      13 Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but
      her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.<BR />
      14 And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put
      away thy wine from thee.<BR />
      15 And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of
      a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink,
      but have poured out my soul before the LORD.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor357689"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">16 Count
      not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance
      of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.<BR />
      17 Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel
      grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.<BR />
      18 And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight.
      So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was
      no more sad.<BR />
      19 And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before
      the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and
      Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.<BR />
      20 Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after
      Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name
      Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.<BR />

      37 And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with
      him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.<BR />
      38 And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not
      first washed before dinner.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor360959"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">39 And
      the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside
      of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening
      and wickedness.<BR />
      40 Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make
      that which is within also?<BR />
      41 But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold,

      woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner

      </FONT><A NAME="anchor366086"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">43 Woe
      unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues,

      </FONT><A NAME="anchor366614"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">44 Woe
      unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves
      which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware
      of them.<BR />
      45 Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master,
      thus saying thou reproachest us also.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor367195"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">46 And
      he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men with

      burdens with one of your fingers.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor367826"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">47 Woe
      unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your
      fathers killed them.<BR />
      48 Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers:
      for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.<BR />
      49 Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets
      and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute:<BR />
      50 That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the
      foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;<BR />
      51 From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, which
      perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto

      53 And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the
      Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to
      speak of many things:<BR />
      54 Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of
      his mouth, that they might accuse him.<BR />

      14 Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the
      captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the
      wise men of Babylon:<BR />
      15 He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is
      the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing
      known to Daniel.<BR />
      16 Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would
      give him time, and that he would show the king the interpretation.<BR />
      17 Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to
      Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:<BR />
      18 That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning
      this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with
      the rest of the wise men of Babylon.<BR />
      19 Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision.
      Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.<BR />
      20 Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever
      and ever: for wisdom and might are his:<BR />
      21 And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings,
      and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge
      to them that know understanding:<BR />
      22 He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is
      in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.<BR />
      23 I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who
      hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now
      what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us
      the king's matter.<BR />
      24 Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained
      to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto
      him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before
      the king, and I will show unto the king the interpretation.<BR />

      Acts 20:17-38</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      17 And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders
      of the church.<BR />
      18 And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know,
      from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I
      have been with you at all seasons,<BR />
      19 Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many
      tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait
      of the Jews:<BR />
      20 And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you,
      but have shown you, and have taught you publicly, and from house
      to house,<BR />
      21 Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance
      toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.<BR />
      22 And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem,
      not knowing the things that shall befall me there:<BR />
      23 Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying
      that bonds and afflictions abide me.<BR />
      24 But none of these things move me, neither count I my life
      dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy,
      and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to
      testify the gospel of the grace of God.<BR />
      25 And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone
      preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.<BR />
      26 Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from
      the blood of all men.<BR />
      27 For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel
      of God.<BR />
      28 Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock,
      over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed
      the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.<BR />
      29 For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves
      enter in among you, not sparing the flock.<BR />
      30 Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse
      things, to draw away disciples after them.<BR />
      31 Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three
      years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.<BR />
      32 And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of
      his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an
      inheritance among all them which are sanctified.<BR />
      33 I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.<BR />
      34 Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered
      unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.<BR />
      35 I have shown you all things, how that so labouring ye ought
      to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus,
      how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.<BR />
      36 And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with
      them all.<BR />
      37 And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed
      him,<BR />
      38 Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they
      should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the
      ship.<BR />

      21 And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto
      the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.<BR />
      22 But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will
      not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him,
      that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.<BR />
      23 And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee
      good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish
      his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she
      weaned him.<BR />
      24 And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with
      three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine,
      and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the
      child was young.<BR />
      25 And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.<BR />
      26 And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am
      the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.<BR />
      27 For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition
      which I asked of him:<BR />
      28 Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he
      liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD
      there.<BR />
      11 And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did
      minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.<BR />

      1 In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable
      multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another,
      he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of
      the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.<BR />
      2 For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither
      hid, that shall not be known.<BR />
      3 Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard
      in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets
      shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.<BR />

      25 Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and
      said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah,
      that will make known unto the king the interpretation.<BR />
      26 The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar,
      Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen,
      and the interpretation thereof?<BR />
      27 Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The
      secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the
      astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, show unto the king;<BR />
      28 But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh
      known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter
      days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are
      these;<BR />
      29 As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon
      thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth
      secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.<BR />
      30 But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom
      that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall
      make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest
      know the thoughts of thy heart.<BR />
      31 Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great
      image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and
      the form thereof was terrible.<BR />
      32 This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms
      of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,<BR />
      33 His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.<BR />
      34 Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which
      smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and
      brake them to pieces.<BR />
      35 Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the
      gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of
      the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that
      no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image
      became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.<BR />

      had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the

      2 And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard,
      and set forth.<BR />
      3 Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand,
      and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship
      was to unlade her burden.<BR />
      4 And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said
      to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.<BR />
      5 And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went
      our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children,
      till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore,
      and prayed.<BR />
      6 And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship;
      and they returned home again.<BR />
      7 And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais,
      and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day.<BR />
      8 And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and
      came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the
      evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him.<BR />
      9 And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.<BR />
      10 And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea
      a certain prophet, named Agabus.<BR />
      11 And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound
      his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost,
      So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this
      girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.<BR />

      21 And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare
      three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before
      the LORD.<BR />
      22 Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto
      all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at
      the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.<BR />

      37 Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath
      given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.<BR />
      38 And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the

      as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron
      that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.<BR />
      41 And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters'
      clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there
      shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou
      sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.<BR />
      42 And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of
      clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.<BR />
      43 And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall

      16 There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea,

      19 And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what

      20 And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said

      are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:<BR />

      Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that
      they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk
      after the customs.<BR />
      22 What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together:
      for they will hear that thou art come.<BR />

      but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.<BR />
      25 As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and
      concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they
      keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood,
      and from strangled, and from fornication.<BR />
      26 Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself
      with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment
      of the days of purification, until that an offering should be

      2 And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in

      3 And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD,
      where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;<BR />
      4 That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.<BR />
      5 And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst

      lay down.<BR />
      6 And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and
      went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And
      he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.<BR />
      7 Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word
      of the LORD yet revealed unto him.<BR />
      8 And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose
      and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me.
      And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.<BR />
      9 Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall
      be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy
      servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.<BR />
      10 And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times,
      Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant
      heareth.<BR />
      11 And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in
      Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall
      tingle.<BR />
      12 In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I

      an end.<BR />

      iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor
      offering for ever.<BR />
      15 And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of
      the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.<BR />
      16 Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered,
      Here am I.<BR />
      17 And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto
      thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and
      more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that
      he said unto thee.<BR />

      22 And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you,
      Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for
      the body, what ye shall put on.<BR />
      23 The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.<BR />
      24 Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which
      neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much
      more are ye better than the fowls?<BR />
      25 And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature
      one cubit?<BR />
      26 If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why
      take ye thought for the rest?<BR />
      27 Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin
      not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was
      not arrayed like one of these.<BR />
      28 If then God so clothe the grass, which is today in the field,
      and tomorrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe
      you, O ye of little faith?<BR />
      29 And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink,
      neither be ye of doubtful mind.<BR />
      30 For all these things do the nations of the world seek after:
      and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.<BR />
      31 But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things
      shall be added unto you.<BR />

      1 Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height
      was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he
      set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.<BR />
      2 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes,
      the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers,
      the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces,
      to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the
      king had set up.<BR />
      3 Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges,
      the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers
      of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication
      of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they
      stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.<BR />
      4 Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people,
      nations, and languages,<BR />
      5 That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp,
      sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall
      down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king
      hath set up:<BR />
      6 And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour
      be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.<BR />
      7 Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound
      of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds
      of music, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell
      down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the

      27 And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which
      were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all
      the people, and laid hands on him,<BR />
      28 Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth
      all men every where against the people, and the law, and this

      polluted this holy place.<BR />
      29 (For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an
      Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)<BR />
      30 And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and
      they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith
      the doors were shut.<BR />
      31 And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the
      chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.<BR />
      32 Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down
      unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers,
      they left beating of Paul.<BR />
      33 Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded
      him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and
      what he had done.<BR />
      34 And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude:
      and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded
      him to be carried into the castle.<BR />
      35 And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne
      of the soldiers for the violence of the people.<BR />
      36 For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away

      1 Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and
      pitched beside Eben-ezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.<BR />
      2 And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel:
      and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines:
      and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.<BR />
      3 And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of
      Israel said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us today before
      the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the
      LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it
      may save us out of the hand of our enemies.<BR />
      4 So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence
      the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth
      between the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas,
      were there with the ark of the covenant of God.<BR />
      5 And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the
      camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth
      rang again.<BR />
      6 And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they
      said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp
      of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD
      was come into the camp.<BR />
      7 And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come
      into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not
      been such a thing heretofore.<BR />
      8 Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these
      mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with
      all the plagues in the wilderness.<BR />
      9 Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines,
      that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to
      you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.<BR />
      10 And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they
      fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter;
      for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.<BR />
      11 And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni
      and Phinehas, were slain.<BR />

      8 Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused
      the Jews.<BR />
      9 They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live
      for ever.<BR />
      10 Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall
      hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery,
      and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship
      the golden image:<BR />
      11 And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, that he should
      be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.<BR />
      12 There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs
      of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego;
      these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy
      gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.<BR />
      13 Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring
      Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then they brought these men
      before the king.<BR />
      14 Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach,
      Meshach, and Abed-nego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship
      the golden image which I have set up?<BR />
      15 Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of
      the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and
      all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the image which
      I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the
      same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who
      is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?<BR />
      16 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the
      king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in
      this matter.<BR />
      17 If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from
      the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine
      hand, O king.<BR />
      18 But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not

      38 Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest
      an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand
      men that were murderers?<BR />
      39 But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city
      in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer
      me to speak unto the people.<BR />
      40 And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs,
      and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was
      made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue,
      saying,<BR />
      1 Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make
      now unto you.<BR />
      2 (And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to
      them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)<BR />
      3 I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in
      Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel,
      and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the
      fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.<BR />
      4 And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering
      into prisons both men and women.<BR />
      5 As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate
      of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren,
      and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto
      Jerusalem, for to be punished.<BR />
      6 And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come
      nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven
      a great light round about me.<BR />
      7 And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me,
      Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?<BR />
      8 And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I
      am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.<BR />
      9 And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid;
      but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.<BR />
      10 And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto
      me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee
      of all things which are appointed for thee to do.<BR />
      11 And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being
      led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.<BR />
      12 And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having
      a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there,<BR />
      13 Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive
      thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.<BR />
      14 And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that
      thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest
      hear the voice of his mouth.<BR />
      15 For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast
      seen and heard.<BR />

      12 And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came
      to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth
      upon his head.<BR />
      13 And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching:
      for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came
      into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.<BR />
      14 And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What
      meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily,
      and told Eli.<BR />
      15 Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were
      dim, that he could not see.<BR />
      16 And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army,
      and I fled today out of the army. And he said, What is there
      done, my son?<BR />
      17 And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before
      the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among
      the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead,
      and the ark of God is taken.<BR />
      18 And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God,
      that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate,
      and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy.
      And he had judged Israel forty years.<BR />
      19 And his daughter-in-law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near
      to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark
      of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband
      were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came
      upon her.<BR />
      20 And about the time of her death the women that stood by her
      said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast borne a son. But she answered
      not, neither did she regard it.<BR />
      21 And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed
      from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of
      her father-in-law and her husband.<BR />

      from him; lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver
      thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison.<BR />
      59 I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast
      paid the very last mite.<BR />

      Lesson<BR />
      Daniel 3:19-30</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      19 Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his
      visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego:
      therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace
      one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.<BR />
      20 And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army
      to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and to cast them into
      the burning fiery furnace.<BR />
      21 Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and
      their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the
      midst of the burning fiery furnace.<BR />
      22 Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the
      furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that
      took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.<BR />
      23 And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell
      down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.<BR />
      24 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in
      haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast
      three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and
      said unto the king, True, O king.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor318790"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">25 He
      answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst
      of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth
      is like the Son of God.<BR />
      26 Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning
      fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego,
      ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither.
      Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, came forth of the midst
      of the fire.<BR />
      27 And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counsellors,
      being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the
      fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither
      were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on
      them.<BR />
      28 Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of
      Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and
      delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed
      the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not
      serve nor worship any god, except their own God.<BR />
      29 Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and
      language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach,
      Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses
      shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that
      can deliver after this sort.<BR />
      30 Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, in
      the province of Babylon.<BR />

      Lesson<BR />
      Acts 22:17-29</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      17 And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem,
      even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;<BR />
      18 And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly
      out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning
      me.<BR />
      19 And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in
      every synagogue them that believed on thee:<BR />
      20 And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also
      was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the
      raiment of them that slew him.<BR />
      21 And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence
      unto the Gentiles.<BR />
      22 And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted
      up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth:
      for it is not fit that he should live.<BR />
      23 And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw
      dust into the air,<BR />
      24 The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle,
      and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might
      know wherefore they cried so against him.<BR />
      25 And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion
      that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is
      a Roman, and uncondemned?<BR />
      26 When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief
      captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a
      Roman.<BR />
      27 Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art
      thou a Roman? He said, Yea.<BR />
      28 And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained
      I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.<BR />
      29 Then straightway they departed from him which should have
      examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he
      knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.<BR />
