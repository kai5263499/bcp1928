      7 Wherefore I prayed, and understanding was given me: I called
      upon God, and the spirit of wisdom came to me.<BR />
      8 I preferred her before sceptres and thrones, and esteemed riches
      nothing in comparison of her.<BR />
      9 Neither compared I unto her any precious stone, because all
      gold in respect of her is as a little sand, and silver shall
      be counted as clay before her.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor25146"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">10 I loved
      her above health and beauty, and chose to have her instead of
      light: for the light that cometh from her never goeth out.<BR />
      11 All good things together came to me with her, and innumerable
      riches in her hands.<BR />
      12 And I rejoiced in them all, because wisdom goeth before them:
      and I knew not that she was the mother of them.<BR />
      13 I learned diligently, and do communicate her liberally: I
      do not hide her riches.<BR />

      1 I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.<BR />
      2 Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and
      every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring
      forth more fruit.<BR />
      3 Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto
      you.<BR />
      4 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit
      of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except
      ye abide in me.<BR />
      5 I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me,
      and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without
      me ye can do nothing.<BR />
      6 If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and
      is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire,
      and they are burned.<BR />
      7 If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask
      what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.<BR />
      8 Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so
      shall ye be my disciples.<BR />
      9 As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue
      ye in my love.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor50881"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">10 If
      ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I
      have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.<BR />
      11 These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain
      in you, and that your joy might be full.<BR />
      12 This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have
      loved you.<BR />
      13 Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his
      life for his friends.<BR />

      are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.<BR />
      15 Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth
      not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all
      things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto
      you.<BR />
      16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained
      you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit
      should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in
      my name, he may give it you.<BR />
      17 These things I command you, that ye love one another.<BR />

      and say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God
      am holy.<BR />
      9 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly
      reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the
      gleanings of thy harvest.<BR />
      10 And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou

      12 And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou

      13 Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob him: the
      wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night
      until the morning.<BR />
      14 Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before
      the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD.<BR />
      15 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not

      1 John 4</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether
      they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into
      the world.<BR />
      2 Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth
      that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:<BR />
      3 And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come
      in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist,
      whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already
      is it in the world.<BR />
      4 Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because
      greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.<BR />
      5 They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and
      the world heareth them.<BR />
      6 We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not
      of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and
      the spirit of error.<BR />
      7 Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every
      one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor136074"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">8 He
      that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor137337"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">9 In
      this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God
      sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live
      through him.<BR />
      10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us,
      and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.<BR />
      11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.<BR />
      12 No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another,
      God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.<BR />
      13 Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because
      he hath given us of his Spirit.<BR />
      14 And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son
      to be the Saviour of the world.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor138513"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">15 Whosoever
      shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him,
      and he in God.<BR />
      16 And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us.
      God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and
      God in him.<BR />
      17 Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness
      in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor140891"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">18 There
      is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because
      fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.<BR />
      19 We love him, because he first loved us.<BR />
      20 If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a
      liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how
      can he love God whom he hath not seen?<BR />
      21 And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth
      God love his brother also.<BR />

      1 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and
      he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;<BR />
      2 And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood
      by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent
      door, and bowed himself toward the ground,<BR />
      3 And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight,
      pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:<BR />
      4 Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet,
      and rest yourselves under the tree:<BR />
      5 And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts;
      after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your
      servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.<BR />
      6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make
      ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make
      cakes upon the hearth.<BR />
      7 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and
      good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.<BR />
      8 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed,
      and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree,
      and they did eat.<BR />
      9 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said,
      Behold, in the tent.<BR />
      10 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to
      the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And
      Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.<BR />
      11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and
      it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.<BR />
      12 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am
      waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?<BR />
      13 And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh,
      saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?<BR />

      any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will

      and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.<BR />

      20 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is
      great, and because their sin is very grievous;<BR />
      21 I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether
      according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not,
      I will know.<BR />
      22 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward
      Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.<BR />
      23 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the
      righteous with the wicked?<BR />
      24 Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt
      thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous
      that are therein?<BR />
      25 That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the
      righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as
      the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all
      the earth do right?<BR />
      26 And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within
      the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.<BR />
      27 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon
      me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes:<BR />
      28 Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous:
      wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said,
      If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.<BR />
      29 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there
      shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for
      forty's sake.<BR />
      30 And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I
      will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And
      he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.<BR />
      31 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto
      the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And
      he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.<BR />
      32 And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak
      yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And
      he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.<BR />
      33 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing
      with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.<BR />

      1 And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea
      by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him
      again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.<BR />
      2 And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful
      for a man to put away his wife? tempting him.<BR />

      4 And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement,
      and to put her away.<BR />
      5 And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of
      your heart he wrote you this precept.<BR />
      6 But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and
      female.<BR />
      7 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and

      2 As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed
      unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.<BR />

      Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a

      which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the
      race that is set before us,<BR />

      for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising
      the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of
      God.<BR />

      4 Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.<BR />

      then are ye bastards, and not sons.<BR />
      9 Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected

      grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit

      1 And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying,<BR />
      2 Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it
      the preaching that I bid thee.<BR />
      3 So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word
      of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three
      days' journey.<BR />
      4 And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and
      he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.<BR />
      5 So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast,
      and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least
      of them.<BR />
      6 For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his
      throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth,
      and sat in ashes.<BR />
      7 And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh
      by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither
      man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not
      feed, nor drink water:<BR />
      8 But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily
      unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and
      from the violence that is in their hands.<BR />
      9 Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from
      his fierce anger, that we perish not?<BR />
      10 And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil
      way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would
      do unto them; and he did it not.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor269999"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">1 But
      it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.<BR />
      2 And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD,
      was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore
      I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious
      God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and
      repentest thee of the evil.<BR />
      3 Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me;
      for it is better for me to die than to live.<BR />
      4 Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?<BR />
      5 So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of
      the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the
      shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.<BR />
      6 And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over
      Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him
      from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.<BR />
      7 But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day,
      and it smote the gourd that it withered.<BR />
      8 And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared
      a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah,
      that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is
      better for me to die than to live.<BR />
      9 And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the
      gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.<BR />
      10 Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the
      which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came
      up in a night, and perished in a night:<BR />
      11 And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are
      more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between
      their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?<BR />

      15 And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country;
      and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.<BR />
      16 And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that
      the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.<BR />

      of thy hired servants.<BR />
      20 And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet
      a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and
      ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.<BR />
      21 And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven,
      and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.<BR />

      23 And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us

      24 For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost,
      and is found. And they began to be merry.<BR />
      25 Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew

      do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment:
      and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with
      my friends:<BR />
      30 But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured
      thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted
      calf.<BR />
      31 And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all
      that I have is thine.<BR />
      32 It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this
      thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is
      found.<BR />

      1 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in
      the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them;
      and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;<BR />
      2 And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into
      your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet,
      and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said,
      Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.<BR />
      3 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him,
      and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did
      bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.<BR />
      12 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son-in-law,
      and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in
      the city, bring them out of this place:<BR />
      13 For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is
      waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent
      us to destroy it.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor288905"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">14 And
      Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his
      daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD
      will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto
      his sons in law.<BR />
      15 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,
      saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are
      here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.<BR />
      16 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and
      upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters;
      the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth,
      and set him without the city.<BR />
      17 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad,
      that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither
      stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou
      be consumed.<BR />
      24 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone
      and fire from the LORD out of heaven;<BR />
      25 And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all
      the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.<BR />
      26 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a
      pillar of salt.<BR />
      27 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where
      he stood before the LORD:<BR />
      28 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the
      land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country
      went up as the smoke of a furnace.<BR />

      2 Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are
      sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that
      in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both
      theirs and ours:<BR />
      3 Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from
      the Lord Jesus Christ.<BR />
      4 I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God
      which is given you by Jesus Christ;<BR />
      5 That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance,
      and in all knowledge;<BR />
      6 Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:<BR />
      7 So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of
      our Lord Jesus Christ:<BR />
      8 Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless
      in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.<BR />
      9 God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship
      of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.<BR />
      10 Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus
      Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no
      divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together
      in the same mind and in the same judgment.<BR />
      11 For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by
      them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions
      among you.<BR />
      12 Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul;
      and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.<BR />
      13 Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye
      baptized in the name of Paul?<BR />
      14 I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;<BR />
      15 Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.<BR />

      4 Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<BR />
      5 Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou
      camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained
      thee a prophet unto the nations.<BR />
      6 Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am

      7 But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou
      shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command
      thee thou shalt speak.<BR />
      8 Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver
      thee, saith the LORD.<BR />
      9 Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And
      the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.<BR />
      10 See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the
      kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and
      to throw down, to build, and to plant.<BR />
      13 And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying,
      What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething pot; and the face
      thereof is toward the north.<BR />
      14 Then the LORD said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall
      break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.<BR />
      15 For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the
      north, saith the LORD; and they shall come, and they shall set
      every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem,
      and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all
      the cities of Judah.<BR />
      16 And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their
      wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto
      other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.<BR />
      17 Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto
      them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces,
      lest I confound thee before them.<BR />
      18 For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and
      an iron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against
      the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the
      priests thereof, and against the people of the land.<BR />
      19 And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail
      against thee; for I am with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver

      1 Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.<BR />
      2 And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and
      all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.<BR />
      3 And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken
      in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,<BR />
      4 They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery,
      in the very act.<BR />
      5 Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned:
      but what sayest thou?<BR />
      6 This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse
      him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the
      ground, as though he heard them not.<BR />
      7 So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and
      said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first
      cast a stone at her.<BR />
      8 And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.<BR />
      9 And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience,
      went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last:
      and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.<BR />
      10 When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman,
      he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath
      no man condemned thee?<BR />
      11 She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do
      I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.<BR />

      9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had
      born unto Abraham, mocking.<BR />
      10 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and
      her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with
      my son, even with Isaac.<BR />
      11 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because
      of his son.<BR />
      12 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight
      because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that
      Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac
      shall thy seed be called.<BR />
      13 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation,
      because he is thy seed.<BR />
      14 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread,
      and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on
      her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed,
      and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.<BR />
      15 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child
      under one of the shrubs.<BR />
      16 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way
      off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death
      of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice,
      and wept.<BR />
      17 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called
      to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee,
      Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where
      he is.<BR />
      18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I

      3 Israel was holiness unto the LORD, and the firstfruits of his

      4 Hear ye the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the

      5 Thus saith the LORD, What iniquity have your fathers found
      in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after
      vanity, and are become vain?<BR />
      6 Neither said they, Where is the LORD that brought us up out

      lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there
      for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell
      thee of.<BR />
      3 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass,
      and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and
      clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went
      unto the place of which God had told him.<BR />
      4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the
      place afar off.<BR />
      5 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the
      ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again
      to you.<BR />
      6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it
      upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife;
      and they went both of them together.<BR />
      7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father:
      and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire
      and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?<BR />
      8 And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for
      a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.<BR />

      they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham
      built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac
      his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.<BR />
      10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to
      slay his son.<BR />
      11 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and
      said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.<BR />
      12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou
      any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing
      thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.<BR />
      13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind
      him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went
      and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in
      the stead of his son.<BR />
      14 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as
      it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be
      seen.<BR />

      1 Corinthians 2</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency
      of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.<BR />
      2 For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus
      Christ, and him crucified.<BR />
      3 And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor356116"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">4 And
      my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's
      wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:<BR />
      5 That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but
      in the power of God.<BR />
      6 Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not
      the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that
      come to nought:<BR />
      7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden
      wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:<BR />
      8 Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they
      known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.<BR />
      9 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither
      have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath
      prepared for them that love him.<BR />
      10 But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the
      Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.<BR />
      11 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit
      of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no
      man, but the Spirit of God.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor357317"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">12 Now
      we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit
      which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely
      given to us of God.<BR />
      13 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom
      teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual
      things with spiritual.<BR />
      14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit
      of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know
      them, because they are spiritually discerned.<BR />
      15 But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself
      is judged of no man.<BR />
      16 For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct
      him? But we have the mind of Christ.<BR />

      And the LORD said unto me, The backsliding Israel hath justified
      herself more than treacherous Judah.<BR />
      12 Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return,
      thou backsliding Israel, saith the LORD; and I will not cause
      mine anger to fall upon you: for I am merciful, saith the LORD,
      and I will not keep anger for ever.<BR />
      13 Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed
      against the LORD thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the
      strangers under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice,
      saith the LORD.<BR />
      14 Turn, O backsliding children, saith the LORD; for I am married
      unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family,
      and I will bring you to Zion:<BR />
      15 And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which
      shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.<BR />
      16 And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased
      in the land, in those days, saith the LORD, they shall say no
      more, The ark of the covenant of the LORD: neither shall it come
      to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit
      it; neither shall that be done any more.<BR />
      17 At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD;
      and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of
      the LORD, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after
      the imagination of their evil heart.<BR />
      18 In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house
      of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the
      north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your
      fathers.<BR />

      45 And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.<BR />
      46 Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth,
      why do ye not believe me?<BR />
      47 He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them
      not, because ye are not of God.<BR />
      48 Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well
      that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?<BR />
      49 Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father,
      and ye do dishonour me.<BR />
      50 And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and
      judgeth.<BR />
      51 Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he
      shall never see death.<BR />
      52 Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a
      devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If
      a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.<BR />
      53 Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and
      the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?<BR />
      54 Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing:
      it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is
      your God:<BR />
      55 Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should
      say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know
      him, and keep his saying.<BR />
      56 Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it,
      and was glad.<BR />
      57 Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years
      old, and hast thou seen Abraham?<BR />

      59 Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself,
      and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them,
      and so passed by.<BR />
