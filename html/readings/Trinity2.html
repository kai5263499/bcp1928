      17 Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath

      Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have
      not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.<BR />
      2 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all
      mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so
      that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.<BR />
      3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though
      I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth
      me nothing.<BR />
      4 Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity
      vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,<BR />
      5 Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not
      easily provoked, thinketh no evil;<BR />
      6 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;<BR />
      7 Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things,
      endureth all things.<BR />
      8 Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they
      shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether
      there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.<BR />
      9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.<BR />
      10 But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is
      in part shall be done away.<BR />
      11 When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a
      child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away
      childish things.<BR />

      13 And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the
      greatest of these is charity.<BR />

      1 Samuel 20:1-7, 12-42</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before
      Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is
      my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?<BR />
      2 And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold,
      my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he
      will show it me: and why should my father hide this thing from
      me? it is not so.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor2398451"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">3 And
      David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth
      that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not
      Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the LORD
      liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me
      and death.<BR />
      4 Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth,
      I will even do it for thee.<BR />
      5 And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, tomorrow is the new moon,
      and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me
      go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at
      even.<BR />
      6 If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked
      leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there
      is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.<BR />
      7 If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but
      if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by
      him.<BR />
      12 And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I
      have sounded my father about tomorrow any time, or the third
      day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send
      not unto thee, and show it thee;<BR />
      13 The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please
      my father to do thee evil, then I will show it thee, and send
      thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with
      thee, as he hath been with my father.<BR />
      14 And thou shalt not only while yet I live show me the kindness
      of the LORD, that I die not:<BR />
      15 But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house
      for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David
      every one from the face of the earth.<BR />
      16 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying,
      Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies.<BR />
      17 And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved
      him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.<BR />
      18 Then Jonathan said to David, Tomorrow is the new moon: and
      thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.<BR />
      19 And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down
      quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself
      when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone
      Ezel.<BR />
      20 And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though
      I shot at a mark.<BR />
      21 And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows.
      If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this
      side of thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to
      thee, and no hurt; as the LORD liveth.<BR />
      22 But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are
      beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.<BR />
      23 And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of,
      behold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever.<BR />
      24 So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was
      come, the king sat him down to eat meat.<BR />
      25 And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon
      a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's
      side, and David's place was empty.<BR />
      26 Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought,
      Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not
      clean.<BR />
      27 And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day
      of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto
      Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat,
      neither yesterday, nor today?<BR />
      28 And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of
      me to go to Bethlehem:<BR />
      29 And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a
      sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to
      be there: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let
      me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh
      not unto the king's table.<BR />
      30 Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said
      unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I
      know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion,
      and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?<BR />
      31 For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou
      shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send
      and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.<BR />
      32 And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him,
      Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?<BR />
      33 And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan
      knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.<BR />
      34 So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did
      eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for
      David, because his father had done him shame.<BR />
      35 And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out
      into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little
      lad with him.<BR />
      36 And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which
      I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.<BR />
      37 And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which
      Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is
      not the arrow beyond thee?<BR />
      38 And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay
      not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his
      master.<BR />
      39 But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew
      the matter.<BR />
      40 And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto
      him, Go, carry them to the city.<BR />
      41 And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place
      toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed
      himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one
      with another, until David exceeded.<BR />
      42 And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have
      sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be
      between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever.
      And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.<BR />

      17 And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons

      1 Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came
      to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses'
      minister, saying,<BR />
      2 Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this
      Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give
      to them, even to the children of Israel.<BR />
      3 Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that
      have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.<BR />
      4 From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river,
      the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the
      great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.<BR />
      5 There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the
      days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee:
      I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.<BR />
      6 Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt
      thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their
      fathers to give them.<BR />
      7 Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe
      to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded
      thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that
      thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor64296"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">8 This
      book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt
      meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do

      make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.<BR />

      10 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,<BR />
      11 Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare
      you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan,
      to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth
      you to possess it.<BR />
      12 And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the
      tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,<BR />
      13 Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded
      you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath
      given you this land.<BR />
      14 Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain
      in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye
      shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of
      valour, and help them;<BR />
      15 Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath given
      you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your
      God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession,
      and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD'S servant gave you on this
      side Jordan toward the sunrising.<BR />
      16 And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest
      us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.<BR />
      17 According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will
      we hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as

      42 And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place:
      and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him,
      that he should not depart from them.<BR />
      43 And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to
      other cities also: for therefore am I sent.<BR />
      44 And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.<BR />
      1 And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to
      hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,<BR />
      2 And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were
      gone out of them, and were washing their nets.<BR />
      3 And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and
      prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And
      he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.<BR />
      4 Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out
      into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.<BR />
      5 And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all
      the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I
      will let down the net.<BR />
      6 And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude
      of fishes: and their net brake.<BR />
      7 And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other
      ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and
      filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.<BR />

      of the fishes which they had taken:<BR />
      10 And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which
      were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not;

      Ezra 7:1, 6-16, 25-28</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of
      Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son
      of Hilkiah,<BR />
      6 This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in
      the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given: and
      the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of
      the LORD his God upon him.<BR />
      7 And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the
      priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and
      the Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes
      the king.<BR />
      8 And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the
      seventh year of the king.<BR />
      9 For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up
      from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he
      to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him.<BR />
      10 For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD,
      and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.<BR />
      11 Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes
      gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the words
      of the commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to Israel.<BR />
      12 Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe
      of the law of the God of heaven, perfect peace, and at such a
      time.<BR />
      13 I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and
      of his priests and Levites, in my realm, which are minded of
      their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem, go with thee.<BR />
      14 Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven counsellors,
      to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law
      of thy God which is in thine hand;<BR />
      15 And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors
      have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation
      is in Jerusalem,<BR />
      16 And all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the
      province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people,
      and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their
      God which is in Jerusalem:<BR />
      25 And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thine
      hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people
      that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God;
      and teach ye them that know them not.<BR />
      26 And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law
      of the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether
      it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods,
      or to imprisonment.<BR />
      27 Blessed be the LORD God of our fathers, which hath put such
      a thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of
      the LORD which is in Jerusalem:<BR />
      28 And hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his counsellors,
      and before all the king's mighty princes. And I was strengthened
      as the hand of the LORD my God was upon me, and I gathered together
      out of Israel chief men to go up with me.<BR />

      Acts 11:1-18</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that
      the Gentiles had also received the word of God.<BR />
      2 And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of
      the circumcision contended with him,<BR />
      3 Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat
      with them.<BR />
      4 But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded
      it by order unto them, saying,<BR />
      5 I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a
      vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet,
      let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:<BR />
      6 Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered,
      and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and
      creeping things, and fowls of the air.<BR />
      7 And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and
      eat.<BR />
      8 But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath
      at any time entered into my mouth.<BR />
      9 But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath
      cleansed, that call not thou common.<BR />
      10 And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again
      into heaven.<BR />
      11 And, behold, immediately there were three men already come
      unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.<BR />
      12 And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover
      these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man's
      house:<BR />
      13 And he showed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which
      stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon,
      whose surname is Peter;<BR />
      14 Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house
      shall be saved.<BR />
      15 And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on
      us at the beginning.<BR />
      16 Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said,
      John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with
      the Holy Ghost.<BR />

      then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed
      on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand
      God?<BR />
      18 When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified
      God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance
      unto life.<BR />

      1 And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from
      Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel,
      and lodged there before they passed over.<BR />
      2 And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went
      through the host;<BR />
      3 And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark
      of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites
      bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after
      it.<BR />
      4 Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand
      cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the
      way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this way heretofore.<BR />
      5 And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for tomorrow
      the LORD will do wonders among you.<BR />
      6 And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark
      of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took
      up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.<BR />
      13 And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet
      of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all
      the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters
      of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from
      above; and they shall stand upon an heap.<BR />
      14 And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents,
      to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant
      before the people;<BR />
      15 And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the
      feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim
      of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time
      of harvest,)<BR />
      16 That the waters which came down from above stood and rose
      up upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan:
      and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the
      salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over
      right against Jericho.<BR />
      17 And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD
      stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the
      Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were
      passed clean over Jordan.<BR />

      And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a
      man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and besought
      him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.<BR />
      13 And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will:

      14 And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and show thyself
      to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses
      commanded, for a testimony unto them.<BR />
      15 But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and

      16 And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.<BR />
      17 And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching,

      20 And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins

      Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins,

      15 And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to
      Ahava; and there abode we in tents three days:<BR />
      21 Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that
      we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right
      way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.<BR />
      22 For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers
      and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because
      we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon
      all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath
      is against all them that forsake him.<BR />
      23 So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was entreated
      of us.<BR />
      31 Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day
      of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our
      God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy,
      and of such as lay in wait by the way.<BR />
      32 And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.<BR />
      33 Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the
      vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth
      the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son
      of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and
      Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites;<BR />
      34 By number and by weight of every one: and all the weight was
      written at that time.<BR />
      35 Also the children of those that had been carried away, which
      were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto
      the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and
      six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin
      offering: all this was a burnt offering unto the LORD.<BR />
      36 And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's

      they furthered the people, and the house of God.<BR />

      21 And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number
      believed, and turned unto the Lord.<BR />
      22 Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church

      1 The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to
      pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in
      Shushan the palace,<BR />
      2 That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of
      Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped,
      which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.<BR />
      3 And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity
      there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the
      wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof
      are burned with fire.<BR />
      4 And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down
      and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before
      the God of heaven,<BR />
      5 And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and
      terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love
      him and observe his commandments:<BR />
      6 Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou
      mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee
      now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants,
      and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have
      sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned.<BR />
      7 We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept
      the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which
      thou commandest thy servant Moses.<BR />
      8 Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy
      servant Moses, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad
      among the nations:<BR />
      9 But if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them;
      though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of
      the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring
      them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.<BR />
      10 Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast
      redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.<BR />
      11 O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to
      the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants,
      who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant
      this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I
      was the king's cupbearer.<BR />

      Acts 12:1-24 </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands
      to vex certain of the church.<BR />
      2 And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.<BR />
      3 And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further
      to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)<BR />
      4 And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and
      delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending
      after Easter to bring him forth to the people.<BR />
      5 Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without
      ceasing of the church unto God for him.<BR />
      6 And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night
      Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains:
      and the keepers before the door kept the prison.<BR />
      7 And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light
      shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised
      him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from
      his hands.<BR />
      8 And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy
      sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment
      about thee, and follow me.<BR />
      9 And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was
      true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.<BR />
      10 When they were past the first and the second ward, they came
      unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to
      them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through
      one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.<BR />
      11 And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of
      a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered
      me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of
      the people of the Jews.<BR />
      12 And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house
      of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many
      were gathered together praying.<BR />
      13 And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came
      to hearken, named Rhoda.<BR />
      14 And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for
      gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate.<BR />
      15 And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed
      that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.<BR />
      16 But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the
      door, and saw him, they were astonished.<BR />
      17 But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace,
      declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison.
      And he said, Go show these things unto James, and to the brethren.
      And he departed, and went into another place.<BR />
      18 Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the
      soldiers, what was become of Peter.<BR />
      19 And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined
      the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death.
      And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there abode.<BR />
      20 And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon:
      but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus
      the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their
      country was nourished by the king's country.<BR />
      21 And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon
      his throne, and made an oration unto them.<BR />
      22 And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a
      god, and not of a man.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor140275"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">23 And
      immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave
      not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the
      ghost.<BR />
      24 But the word of God grew and multiplied.<BR />

      Joshua 6:1-7, 11, 14-20</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of
      Israel: none went out, and none came in.<BR />
      2 And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine
      hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valour.<BR />
      3 And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round
      about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.<BR />
      4 And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets
      of rams' horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city
      seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.<BR />
      5 And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast
      with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet,
      all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of
      the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up
      every man straight before him.<BR />
      6 And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto
      them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests
      bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD.<BR />
      7 And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city,
      and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.<BR />
      11 So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it
      once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.<BR />
      14 And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned
      into the camp: so they did six days.<BR />
      15 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early
      about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the
      same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the
      city seven times.<BR />
      16 And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests
      blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for
      the LORD hath given you the city.<BR />
      17 And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are
      therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and
      all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers
      that we sent.<BR />
      18 And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing,
      lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed
      thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.<BR />
      19 But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron,
      are consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the treasury
      of the LORD.<BR />
      20 So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets:
      and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet,
      and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell
      down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man
      straight before him, and they took the city.<BR />

      1 And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first,
      that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked
      the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands.<BR />
      2 And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that
      which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?<BR />
      3 And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as
      this, what David did, when himself was an hungered, and they
      which were with him.<BR />
      4 How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the
      showbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it
      is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?<BR />
      5 And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of
      the sabbath.<BR />
      6 And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered
      into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right
      hand was withered.<BR />
      7 And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would
      heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against
      him.<BR />
      8 But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the
      withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he
      arose and stood forth.<BR />
      9 Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it
      lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save
      life, or to destroy it?<BR />
      10 And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man,
      Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored
      whole as the other.<BR />

      1 And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year
      of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took
      up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been beforetime

      </FONT><A NAME="anchor151719"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">2 Wherefore
      the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou
      art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then
      I was very sore afraid,<BR />
      3 And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should
      not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers'
      sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with
      fire?<BR />
      4 Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request?

      5 And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy
      servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send
      me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that
      I may build it.<BR />
      6 And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,)
      For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return?
      So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.<BR />
      7 Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters
      be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may
      convey me over till I come into Judah;<BR />
      8 And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that

      25 And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had
      fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname
      was Mark.<BR />
      1 Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets
      and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger,
      and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with
      Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.<BR />
      2 As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost
      said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I
      have called them.<BR />
      3 And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on
      them, they sent them away.<BR />
      4 So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto
      Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.<BR />
      5 And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God
      in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their
      minister.<BR />
      6 And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found
      a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-jesus:<BR />
      7 Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a
      prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to
      hear the word of God.<BR />
      8 But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation)
      withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.<BR />
      9 Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy
      Ghost, set his eyes on him,<BR />
      10 And said, O full of all subtlety and all mischief, thou child
      of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not
      cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?<BR />
      11 And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou
      shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately
      there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking
      some to lead him by the hand.<BR />
      12 Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being
      astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.<BR />

      6 Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and
      Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou knowest
      the thing that the LORD said unto Moses the man of God concerning
      me and thee in Kadesh-barnea.<BR />
      7 Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent
      me from Kadesh-barnea to espy out the land; and I brought him
      word again as it was in mine heart.<BR />
      8 Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart
      of the people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God.<BR />
      9 And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon
      thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy children's
      for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God.<BR />
      10 And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said,
      these forty and five years, even since the LORD spake this word
      unto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness:
      and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old.<BR />
      11 As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses
      sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now,
      for war, both to go out, and to come in.<BR />
      12 Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake
      in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were
      there, and that the cities were great and fenced: if so be the
      LORD will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out,
      as the LORD said.<BR />
      13 And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh
      Hebron for an inheritance.<BR />
      14 Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of
      Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly

      15 And the name of Hebron before was Kirjath-arba; which Arba
      was a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from

      9 Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them
      the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army
      and horsemen with me.<BR />
      10 When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite,
      heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come
      a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.<BR />
      11 So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.<BR />
      12 And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither
      told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem:
      neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode
      upon.<BR />
      13 And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before
      the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of
      Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were
      consumed with fire.<BR />
      14 Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's
      pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me
      to pass.<BR />
      15 Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall,
      and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so
      returned.<BR />
      16 And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither
      had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to
      the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.<BR />
      17 Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in,
      how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with
      fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we
      be no more a reproach.<BR />
      18 Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon
      me; as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And
      they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their
      hands for this good work.<BR />
      19 But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the
      Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to
      scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye
      do? will ye rebel against the king?<BR />
      20 Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven,
      he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and
      build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.<BR />

      13 Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came
      to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned
      to Jerusalem.<BR />
      14 But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in
      Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and
      sat down.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor168098"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">15 And
      after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the
      synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye
      have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.<BR />
      16 Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men
      of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.<BR />
      17 The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted
      the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt,
      and with an high arm brought he them out of it.<BR />
      18 And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners
      in the wilderness.<BR />
      19 And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan,
      he divided their land to them by lot.<BR />
      20 And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of
      four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.<BR />
      21 And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them
      Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space
      of forty years.<BR />
      22 And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David
      to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I
      have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart,
      which shall fulfil all my will.<BR />
      23 Of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised
      unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus:<BR />
      24 When John had first preached before his coming the baptism
      of repentance to all the people of Israel.<BR />
      25 And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that
      I am? I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose
      shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose.<BR />

      1 And it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given
      rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua
      waxed old and stricken in age.<BR />
      2 And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and
      for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers,
      and said unto them, I am old and stricken in age:<BR />
      3 And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto
      all these nations because of you; for the LORD your God is he
      that hath fought for you.<BR />
      11 Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the
      LORD your God.<BR />
      12 Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant
      of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall
      make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you:<BR />
      13 Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive
      out any of these nations from before you; but they shall be snares
      and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in
      your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which the
      LORD your God hath given you.<BR />
      14 And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth:
      and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not
      one thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your
      God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and
      not one thing hath failed thereof.<BR />

      it shall come to pass, that as all good things are come upon

      off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.<BR />
      16 When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God,
      which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods,
      and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD

      27 But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good
      to them which hate you,<BR />
      28 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully
      use you.<BR />
      29 And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also
      the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take
      thy coat also.<BR />
      30 Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh
      away thy goods ask them not again.<BR />
      31 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them
      likewise.<BR />
      32 For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for
      sinners also love those that love them.<BR />
      33 And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank
      have ye? for sinners also do even the same.<BR />
      34 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank
      have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much
      again.<BR />
      35 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for
      nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be

      and to the evil.<BR />
      36 Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.<BR />
      37 Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye
      shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:<BR />
      38 Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed
      down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into

      shall be measured to you again.<BR />

      So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto
      the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.<BR />
      7 But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the
      Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the
      walls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began
      to be stopped, then they were very wroth,<BR />
      8 And conspired all of them together to come and to fight against
      Jerusalem, and to hinder it.<BR />
      9 Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch
      against them day and night, because of them.<BR />
      10 And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is
      decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to
      build the wall.<BR />
      11 And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see,
      till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause
      the work to cease.<BR />
      12 And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them
      came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye
      shall return unto us they will be upon you.<BR />
      13 Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on
      the higher places, I even set the people after their families
      with their swords, their spears, and their bows.<BR />
      14 And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to
      the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of
      them: remember the Lord, which is great and terrible, and fight
      for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives,
      and your houses.<BR />
      15 And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known
      unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we
      returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.<BR />
      16 And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of
      my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held
      both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons;
      and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.<BR />
      17 They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens,
      with those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought
      in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon.<BR />
      18 For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side,
      and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.<BR />
      19 And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the
      rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated
      upon the wall, one far from another.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor182634"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">20 In
      what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort
      ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us.<BR />
      21 So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears
      from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.<BR />
      22 Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every
      one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night
      they may be a guard to us, and labour on the day.<BR />
      23 So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men
      of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes,
      saving that every one put them off for washing.<BR />

      26 Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever
      among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.<BR />
      27 For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because
      they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are
      read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning
      him.<BR />
      28 And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired
      they Pilate that he should be slain.<BR />
      29 And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they
      took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre.<BR />
      30 But God raised him from the dead:<BR />
      31 And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from
      Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people.<BR />
      32 And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise
      which was made unto the fathers,<BR />
      33 God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that
      he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second
      psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.<BR />
      34 And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now
      no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will
      give you the sure mercies of David.<BR />
      35 Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer
      thine Holy One to see corruption.<BR />
      36 For David, after he had served his own generation by the will
      of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw
      corruption:<BR />
      37 But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.<BR />
      38 Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through
      this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:<BR />
      39 And by him all that believe are justified from all things,
      from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.<BR />
      40 Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken
      of in the prophets;<BR />

      ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your
      days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man
      declare it unto you.<BR />
      42 And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles
      besought that these words might be preached to them the next
      sabbath.<BR />
      43 Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews
      and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking
      to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.<BR />
