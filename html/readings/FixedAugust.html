      1 And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal
      how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.<BR />
      2 Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the
      gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life
      of one of them by tomorrow about this time.<BR />
      3 And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and
      came to Beer-sheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant
      there.<BR />
      4 But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and
      came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for
      himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD,
      take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.<BR />
      5 And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then
      an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.<BR />
      6 And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baked on the coals,
      and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and
      laid him down again.<BR />
      7 And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched
      him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great
      for thee.<BR />
      8 And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength
      of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount
      of God.<BR />
      9 And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold,
      the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him, What
      doest thou here, Elijah?<BR />
      10 And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of
      hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant,
      thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword;
      and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it
      away.<BR />
      11 And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the
      LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong
      wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before
      the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind
      an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake:<BR />
      12 And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the
      fire: and after the fire a still small voice.<BR />

      have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in

      3 But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:<BR />
      4 In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them

      29 And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai
      with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came
      down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his
      face shone while he talked with him.<BR />
      30 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold,
      the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh
      him.<BR />
      31 And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of
      the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them.<BR />
      32 And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he
      gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him
      in mount Sinai.<BR />
      33 And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a veil
      on his face.<BR />
      34 But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him,
      he took the veil off, until he came out. And he came out, and
      spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded.<BR />
      35 And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the
      skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the veil upon his face
      again, until he went in to speak with him.<BR />

      1 Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some
      others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation
      from you?<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor39004"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">2 Ye are
      our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:<BR />
      3 Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of
      Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit
      of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables
      of the heart.<BR />
      4 And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:<BR />
      5 Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing
      as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;<BR />
      6 Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament;
      not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth,
      but the spirit giveth life.<BR />
      7 But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones,
      was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly
      behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which
      glory was to be done away:<BR />
      8 How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?<BR />
      9 For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more
      doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.<BR />
      10 For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this
      respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.<BR />
      11 For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that
      which remaineth is glorious.<BR />
      12 Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness
      of speech:<BR />
      13 And not as Moses, which put a veil over his face, that the
      children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that
      which is abolished:<BR />
      14 But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth
      the same veil untaken away in the reading of the old testament;
      which veil is done away in Christ.<BR />
      15 But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon
      their heart.<BR />
      16 Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall
      be taken away.<BR />
      17 Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord
      is, there is liberty.<BR />
      18 But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory
      of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory,
      even as by the Spirit of the Lord.<BR />

      13 Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this
      one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and
      reaching forth unto those things which are before,<BR />
      14 I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling

      15 Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and
      if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even
      this unto you.<BR />
      16 Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk
      by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.<BR />
      17 Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which
      walk so as ye have us for an example.<BR />
      18 (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell
      you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:<BR />
      19 Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose
      glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)<BR />
      20 For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look
      for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:<BR />
      21 Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like

      been, saith the LORD: but to this man will I look, even to him
      that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.<BR />
      18 For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come,
      that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come,
      and see my glory.<BR />
      19 And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that
      escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that
      draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles afar off, that
      have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they
      shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.<BR />
      20 And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto
      the LORD out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and
      in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy
      mountain Jerusalem, saith the LORD, as the children of Israel
      bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD.<BR />
      21 And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites,
      saith the LORD.<BR />
      22 For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make,
      shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and
      your name remain.<BR />
      23 And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another,
      and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship
      before me, saith the LORD.<BR />

      1 Peter 5:1-11</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder,
      and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker
      of the glory that shall be revealed:<BR />
      2 Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight
      thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre,
      but of a ready mind;<BR />
      3 Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being examples
      to the flock.<BR />
      4 And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive
      a crown of glory that fadeth not away.<BR />
      5 Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea,
      all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility:
      for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.<BR />
      6 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that
      he may exalt you in due time:<BR />
      7 Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.<BR />
      8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as
      a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:<BR />
      9 Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions
      are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.<BR />
      10 But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal
      glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make
      you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.<BR />
      11 To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.<BR />
