      29 And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite,
      Moses' father-in-law, We are journeying unto the place of which
      the LORD said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we
      will do thee good: for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel.<BR />
      30 And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to
      mine own land, and to my kindred.<BR />
      31 And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou
      knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest
      be to us instead of eyes.<BR />
      32 And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that
      what goodness the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do
      unto thee.<BR />
      33 And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days' journey:
      and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the
      three days' journey, to search out a resting place for them.<BR />

      32 And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell
      of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David
      also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:<BR />
      33 Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness,

      34 Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword,
      out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned
      to flight the armies of the aliens.<BR />
      35 Women received their dead raised to life again: and others
      were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain
      a better resurrection:<BR />
      36 And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea,
      moreover of bonds and imprisonment:<BR />
      37 They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were
      slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins;
      being destitute, afflicted, tormented;<BR />
      38 (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts,

      2 Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you:

      places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert
      like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness shall be found
      therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.<BR />
      4 Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation:
      for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment
      to rest for a light of the people.<BR />

      righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine arms

      6 Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath:
      for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall
      wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die

      8 For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm
      shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever,
      and my salvation from generation to generation.<BR />
      9 Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as
      in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not
      it that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?<BR />
      10 Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the
      great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the
      ransomed to pass over?<BR />
      11 Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come

      4 And the mixed multitude that was among them fell a-lusting:
      and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall
      give us flesh to eat?<BR />
      5 We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the
      cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and
      the garlic:<BR />
      6 But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside
      this manna, before our eyes.<BR />
      10 Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families,
      every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD
      was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.<BR />
      11 And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted
      thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight,
      that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?<BR />
      12 Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that
      thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing
      father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest
      unto their fathers?<BR />
      13 Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for
      they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.<BR />
      14 I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is
      too heavy for me.<BR />
      15 And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of
      hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see
      my wretchedness.<BR />
      23 And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD'S hand waxed short?
      thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee
      or not.<BR />
      31 And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails
      from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's
      journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other
      side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon
      the face of the earth.<BR />
      32 And the people stood up all that day, and all that night,
      and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered
      least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for

      Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a
      cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin
      which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the
      race that is set before us,<BR />
      2 Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who
      for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising
      the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of
      God.<BR />
      3 For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners
      against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.<BR />
      4 Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.<BR />
      5 And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you
      as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of
      the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:<BR />
      6 For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every
      son whom he receiveth.<BR />
      7 If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons;
      for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor195638"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">8 But
      if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then
      are ye bastards, and not sons.<BR />
      9 Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected
      us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in
      subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?<BR />
      10 For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own
      pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of
      his holiness.<BR />
      11 Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but
      grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit
      of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.<BR />
      12 Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble
      knees;<BR />
      13 And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is
      lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.<BR />
      14 Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no

      1 And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian
      woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.<BR />
      2 And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath
      he not spoken also by us? And the LORD heard it.<BR />
      3 (Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were
      upon the face of the earth.)<BR />
      4 And the LORD spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and
      unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation.
      And they three came out.<BR />
      5 And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood
      in the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and
      they both came forth.<BR />
      6 And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among
      you, I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision,
      and will speak unto him in a dream.<BR />
      7 My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.<BR />
      8 With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and
      not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he
      behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my
      servant Moses?<BR />
      9 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he
      departed.<BR />
      10 And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold,
      Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam,
      and, behold, she was leprous.<BR />
      11 And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee,
      lay not the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and
      wherein we have sinned.<BR />
      12 Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed
      when he cometh out of his mother's womb.<BR />
      13 And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God,
      I beseech thee.<BR />
      14 And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in
      her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut
      out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received
      in again.<BR />
      15 And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the
      people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.<BR />
      16 And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched
      in the wilderness of Paran.<BR />

      Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now
      Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)<BR />
      23 And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from
      thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it
      between two upon a staff; and they brought of the pomegranates,

      24 The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster

      18 And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled
      with the Spirit;<BR />
      19 Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,

      yourselves one to another in the fear of God.<BR />
      22 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the
      Lord.<BR />
      23 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is
      the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.<BR />
      24 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the
      wives be to their own husbands in every thing.<BR />
      25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church,
      and gave himself for it;<BR />
      26 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of
      water by the word,<BR />
      27 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not
      having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should
      be holy and without blemish.<BR />
      28 So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that
      loveth his wife loveth himself.<BR />
      29 For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and
      cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:<BR />
      30 For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.<BR />
      31 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and
      shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.<BR />
      32 This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and
      the church.<BR />
      33 Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his
      wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her
      husband.<BR />

      1 And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried;
      and the people wept that night.<BR />
      2 And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against
      Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that
      we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in
      this wilderness!<BR />
      3 And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall
      by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey?
      were it not better for us to return into Egypt?<BR />
      4 And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let
      us return into Egypt.<BR />
      5 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly
      of the congregation of the children of Israel.<BR />
      6 And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,
      which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:<BR />
      7 And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel,
      saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, is an
      exceeding good land.<BR />
      8 If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this
      land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.<BR />
      9 Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people
      of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is departed
      from them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not.<BR />
      10 But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And
      the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation
      before all the children of Israel.<BR />

      Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it
      is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not
      with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied
      therein.<BR />
      10 We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which
      serve the tabernacle.<BR />
      11 For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into
      the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without
      the camp.<BR />
      12 Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with
      his own blood, suffered without the gate.<BR />
      13 Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing
      his reproach.<BR />
      14 For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.<BR />
      15 By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God
      continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to
