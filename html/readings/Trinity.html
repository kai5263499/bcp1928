      Isaiah 6:1-8</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting
      upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.<BR />
      2 Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with
      twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet,
      and with twain he did fly.<BR />
      3 And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is
      the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.<BR />
      4 And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried,
      and the house was filled with smoke.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor249340"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">5 Then
      said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean
      lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for
      mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.<BR />
      6 Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal
      in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:<BR />
      7 And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched
      thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.<BR />
      8 Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send,
      and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.<BR />

      1 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered
      throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,<BR />
      2 Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through
      sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of
      the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.<BR />
      3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
      according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a
      lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor250651"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">4 To
      an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth
      not away, reserved in heaven for you,<BR />
      5 Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation
      ready to be revealed in the last time.<BR />
      6 Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need
      be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:<BR />
      7 That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than
      of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be
      found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus
      Christ:<BR />
      8 Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him
      not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full
      of glory:<BR />
      9 Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your
      souls.<BR />
      10 Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched
      diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto
      you:<BR />
      11 Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ
      which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the
      sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.<BR />
      12 Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto
      us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto
      you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy
      Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to
      look into.<BR />

      1 The pride of the height, the clear firmament, the beauty of
      heaven, with his glorious shew;<BR />
      2 The sun when it appeareth, declaring at his rising a marvellous
      instrument, the work of the most High:<BR />
      3 At noon it parcheth the country, and who can abide the burning
      heat thereof?<BR />
      4 A man blowing a furnace is in works of heat, but the sun burneth
      the mountains three times more: breathing out fiery vapours,
      and sending forth bright beams, it dimmeth the eyes.<BR />
      5 Great is the Lord that made it; and at his commandment it runneth
      hastily.<BR />
      6 He made the moon also to serve in her season for a declaration
      of times, and a sign of the world.<BR />
      7 From the moon is the sign of feasts, a light that decreaseth
      in her perfection.<BR />
      8 The month is called after her name, increasing wonderfully
      in her changing, being an instrument of the armies above, shining
      in the firmament of heaven:<BR />
      9 The beauty of heaven, the glory of the stars, an ornament giving
      light in the highest places of the Lord.<BR />
      10 At the commandment of the Holy One they will stand in their
      order, and never faint in their watches.<BR />
      11 Look upon the rainbow, and praise him that made it; very beautiful
      it is in the brightness thereof.<BR />
      12 It compasseth the heaven about with a glorious circle, and
      the hands of the most High have bended it.<BR />

      1 I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye
      walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,<BR />
      2 With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing
      one another in love;<BR />
      3 Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of

      5 One Lord, one faith, one baptism,<BR />
      6 One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all,
      and in you all.<BR />
      7 But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure
      of the gift of Christ.<BR />
      8 Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity
      captive, and gave gifts unto men.<BR />
      9 (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended
      first into the lower parts of the earth?<BR />
      10 He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above
      all heavens, that he might fill all things.)<BR />
      11 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some,
      evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;<BR />
      12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry,
      for the edifying of the body of Christ:<BR />
      13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge
      of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the
      stature of the fulness of Christ:<BR />
      14 That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro,
      and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight
      of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;<BR />
      15 But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all
      things, which is the head, even Christ:<BR />
      16 From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted
      by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual
      working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the
      body unto the edifying of itself in love.<BR />

      Numbers 16:1-14</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of
      Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son
      of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men:<BR />
      2 And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children
      of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous
      in the congregation, men of renown:<BR />
      3 And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against
      Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing
      all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD
      is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the
      congregation of the LORD?<BR />
      4 And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face:<BR />
      5 And he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even
      tomorrow the LORD will show who are his, and who is holy; and
      will cause him to come near unto him: even him whom he hath chosen
      will he cause to come near unto him.<BR />
      6 This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;<BR />
      7 And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD
      tomorrow: and it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth choose,
      he shall be holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.<BR />
      8 And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:<BR />
      9 Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel
      hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring
      you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the
      LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them?<BR />
      10 And he hath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren
      the sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?<BR />
      11 For which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered
      together against the LORD: and what is Aaron, that ye murmur
      against him?<BR />
      12 And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab:
      which said, We will not come up:<BR />
      13 Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a
      land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness,
      except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?<BR />
      14 Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth
      with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards:
      wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.<BR />

      Luke 1:1-25</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order
      a declaration of those things which are most surely believed
      among us,<BR />
      2 Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning
      were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;<BR />
      3 It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding
      of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order,
      most excellent Theophilus,<BR />
      4 That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein
      thou hast been instructed.<BR />
      5 There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain
      priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was
      of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.<BR />
      6 And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the
      commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.<BR />
      7 And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and
      they both were now well stricken in years.<BR />
      8 And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office
      before God in the order of his course,<BR />
      9 According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was
      to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.<BR />
      10 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without
      at the time of incense.<BR />
      11 And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing
      on the right side of the altar of incense.<BR />
      12 And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell
      upon him.<BR />
      13 But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy
      prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son,
      and thou shalt call his name John.<BR />
      14 And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice
      at his birth.<BR />
      15 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall
      drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with
      the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.<BR />
      16 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord
      their God.<BR />
      17 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias,
      to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient
      to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for
      the Lord.<BR />
      18 And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this?
      for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.<BR />
      19 And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that
      stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee,
      and to show thee these glad tidings.<BR />

      behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the
      day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest
      not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.<BR />
      21 And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he
      tarried so long in the temple.<BR />
      22 And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they
      perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned
      unto them, and remained speechless.<BR />
      23 And it came to pass, that as soon as the days of his ministration
      were accomplished, he departed to his own house.<BR />
      24 And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid
      herself five months, saying,<BR />

      Ezra 1:1-8</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word
      of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the
      LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made
      a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in
      writing, saying,<BR />
      2 Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath
      given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me
      to build him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.<BR />
      3 Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him,
      and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build
      the house of the LORD God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is
      in Jerusalem.<BR />
      4 And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let
      the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and
      with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for
      the house of God that is in Jerusalem.<BR />
      5 Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin,
      and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit
      God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which
      is in Jerusalem.<BR />
      6 And all they that were about them strengthened their hands
      with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts,
      and with precious things, beside all that was willingly offered.<BR />
      7 Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house
      of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem,
      and had put them in the house of his gods;<BR />
      8 Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand
      of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar,
      the prince of Judah.<BR />

      Acts 7:1-16</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Then said the high priest, Are these things so?<BR />
      2 And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of
      glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia,
      before he dwelt in Charran,<BR />
      3 And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy
      kindred, and come into the land which I shall show thee.<BR />
      4 Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in
      Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed
      him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.<BR />
      5 And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as
      to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to
      him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet
      he had no child.<BR />
      6 And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in
      a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage,
      and entreat them evil four hundred years.<BR />
      7 And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge,
      said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me
      in this place.<BR />
      8 And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham
      begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat
      Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs.<BR />
      9 And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt:
      but God was with him,<BR />
      10 And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him
      favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and
      he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.<BR />
      11 Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan,
      and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.<BR />
      12 But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent
      out our fathers first.<BR />
      13 And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren;
      and Joseph's kindred was made known unto Pharaoh.<BR />
      14 Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and
      all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.<BR />
      15 So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,<BR />
      16 And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre
      that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the
      father of Sychem.<BR />

      Numbers 16:15-35</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      15 And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect
      not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them,
      neither have I hurt one of them.<BR />
      16 And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before
      the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, tomorrow:<BR />
      17 And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and
      bring ye before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and
      fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each of you his censer.<BR />
      18 And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them,
      and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle
      of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.<BR />
      19 And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto
      the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory
      of the LORD appeared unto all the congregation.<BR />
      20 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,<BR />
      21 Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may
      consume them in a moment.<BR />
      22 And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of
      the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be
      wroth with all the congregation?<BR />
      23 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,<BR />
      24 Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about
      the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.<BR />
      25 And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the
      elders of Israel followed him.<BR />
      26 And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray
      you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of
      theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.<BR />
      27 So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram,
      on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the
      door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their
      little children.<BR />
      28 And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent
      me to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own
      mind.<BR />
      29 If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be
      visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath not
      sent me.<BR />
      30 But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth,
      and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they
      go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these
      men have provoked the LORD.<BR />
      31 And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all
      these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them:<BR />
      32 And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and
      their houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and
      all their goods.<BR />
      33 They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into
      the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from
      among the congregation.<BR />
      34 And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry
      of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.<BR />
      35 And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the
      two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.<BR />

      26 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God
      unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,<BR />
      27 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the
      house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.<BR />
      28 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that
      art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou
      among women.<BR />
      29 And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and
      cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.<BR />
      30 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast
      found favour with God.<BR />
      31 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth
      a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.<BR />
      32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest:
      and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father
      David:<BR />
      33 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of
      his kingdom there shall be no end.<BR />
      34 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I
      know not a man?<BR />
      35 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall
      come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow
      thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee
      shall be called the Son of God.<BR />

      Ezra 4:7, 11-24</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      7 And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel,
      and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia;
      and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue,
      and interpreted in the Syrian tongue.<BR />
      11 This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even
      unto Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side the
      river, and at such a time.<BR />
      12 Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from
      thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and
      the bad city, and have set up the walls thereof, and joined the
      foundations.<BR />
      13 Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded,
      and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute,
      and custom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings.<BR />
      14 Now because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and
      it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore
      have we sent and certified the king;<BR />
      15 That search may be made in the book of the records of thy
      fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know
      that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and
      provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same
      of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed.<BR />
      16 We certify the king that, if this city be builded again, and
      the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion
      on this side the river.<BR />
      17 Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and
      to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that
      dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace,
      and at such a time.<BR />
      18 The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before
      me.<BR />
      19 And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found
      that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings,
      and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.<BR />
      20 There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have
      ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute,
      and custom, was paid unto them.<BR />
      21 Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that
      this city be not builded, until another commandment shall be
      given from me.<BR />
      22 Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage
      grow to the hurt of the kings?<BR />
      23 Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before
      Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went
      up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease
      by force and power.<BR />
      24 Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem.
      So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king
      of Persia.<BR />

      17 But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had
      sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,<BR />
      18 Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph.<BR />
      19 The same dealt subtly with our kindred, and evil entreated
      our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the
      end they might not live.<BR />
      20 In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and
      nourished up in his father's house three months:<BR />
      21 And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up,
      and nourished him for her own son.<BR />
      22 And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians,
      and was mighty in words and in deeds.<BR />
      23 And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart
      to visit his brethren the children of Israel.<BR />
      24 And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and
      avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:<BR />
      25 For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that
      God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.<BR />
      26 And the next day he showed himself unto them as they strove,
      and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren;
      why do ye wrong one to another?<BR />
      27 But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying,
      Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?<BR />
      28 Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?<BR />
      29 Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the
      land of Madian, where he begat two sons.<BR />
      30 And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in
      the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame
      of fire in a bush.<BR />
      31 When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew
      near to behold it, the voice of the Lord came unto him,<BR />
      32 Saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and
      the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled,
      and durst not behold.<BR />

      said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the

      is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down

      them a rod according to the house of their fathers, of all their
      princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods:

      6 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one
      of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one,
      according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the
      rod of Aaron was among their rods.<BR />

      3 Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,<BR />
      4 Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your ceiled houses, and

      35 This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler
      and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer
      by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush.<BR />
      36 He brought them out, after that he had shown wonders and signs
      in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness
      forty years.<BR />
      37 This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel,
      A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren,
      like unto me; him shall ye hear.<BR />
      38 This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with
      the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our
      fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us:<BR />
      39 To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them,
      and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,<BR />
      40 Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for
      this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot
      not what is become of him.<BR />
      41 And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice
      unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.<BR />
      42 Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven;
      as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel,
      have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space
      of forty years in the wilderness?<BR />
      43 Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of
      your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and
      I will carry you away beyond Babylon.<BR />
      44 Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness,
      as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make
      it according to the fashion that he had seen.<BR />
      45 Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus

      in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.<BR />

      fetch you water out of this rock?<BR />

      54 When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart,
      and they gnashed on him with their teeth.<BR />
      55 But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly

      57 Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears,

      laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was

      59 And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord

      60 And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay
      not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell
      asleep.<BR />
      1 And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there
      was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem;
      and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of

      Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that
      hath befallen us:<BR />
      15 How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in
      Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers:<BR />
      16 And when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent
      an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold,
      we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border:<BR />
      17 Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not
      pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will
      we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's
      high way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left,
      until we have passed thy borders.<BR />
      18 And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I
      come out against thee with the sword.<BR />
      19 And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the
      high way: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will
      pay for it: I will only, without doing any thing else, go through
      on my feet.<BR />

      7 Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which
      is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word
      of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of
      Iddo the prophet, saying,<BR />
      8 I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and
      he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and
      behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white.<BR />
      9 Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that
      talked with me said unto me, I will show thee what these be.<BR />
      10 And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and
      said, These are they whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro
      through the earth.<BR />
      11 And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the
      myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the
      earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.<BR />
      12 Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts,
      how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities
      of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore
      and ten years?<BR />
      13 And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me with good
      words and comfortable words.<BR />
      14 So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou,
      saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem
      and for Zion with a great jealousy.<BR />
      15 And I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at
      ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward
      the affliction.<BR />
      16 Therefore thus saith the LORD; I am returned to Jerusalem
      with mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of
      hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.<BR />
      17 Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities through
      prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD shall yet
      comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.<BR />

      5 Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached
      Christ unto them.<BR />
      6 And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things
      which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he
      did.<BR />
      7 For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many
      that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and
      that were lame, were healed.<BR />
      8 And there was great joy in that city.<BR />
      9 But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime
      in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria,
      giving out that himself was some great one:<BR />
      10 To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest,
      saying, This man is the great power of God.<BR />
      11 And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had
      bewitched them with sorceries.<BR />
      12 But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning
      the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized,
      both men and women.<BR />
      13 Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized,
      he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles
      and signs which were done.<BR />
      14 Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria
      had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:<BR />
      15 Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they
      might receive the Holy Ghost:<BR />
      16 (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were
      baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)<BR />
      17 Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the
      Holy Ghost.<BR />
      18 And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles'
      hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,<BR />
      19 Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay
      hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.<BR />
      20 But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because
      thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with
      money.<BR />

      perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.<BR />
      23 For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and
      in the bond of iniquity.<BR />
      24 Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me,
      that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.<BR />
      25 And they, when they had testified and preached the word of

      the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed
      for the people.<BR />
      8 And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and
      set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one
      that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.<BR />
      9 And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole,
      and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when
      he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.<BR />

      1 And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree
      from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.<BR />
      2 (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor
      of Syria.)<BR />
      3 And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.<BR />
      4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth,
      into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem;
      (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)<BR />
      5 To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.<BR />
      6 And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished
      that she should be delivered.<BR />
      7 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in
      swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was
      no room for them in the inn.<BR />
      8 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the
      field, keeping watch over their flock by night.<BR />
      9 And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory
      of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.<BR />
      10 And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring
      you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.<BR />
      11 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour,
      which is Christ the Lord.<BR />
      12 And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe
      wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.<BR />
      13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly
      host praising God, and saying,<BR />
      14 Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will
      toward men.<BR />
      15 And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them
      into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go
      even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass,
      which the Lord hath made known unto us.<BR />
      16 And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and
      the babe lying in a manger.<BR />
      17 And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying
      which was told them concerning this child.<BR />
      18 And all they that heard it wondered at those things which
      were told them by the shepherds.<BR />
      19 But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.<BR />
      20 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for
      all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto
      them.<BR />

      1 I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with
      a measuring line in his hand.<BR />
      2 Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure
      Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the
      length thereof.<BR />
      3 And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and
      another angel went out to meet him,<BR />
      4 And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem
      shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of
      men and cattle therein:<BR />
      5 For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round
      about, and will be the glory in the midst of her.<BR />
      6 Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north, saith
      the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the
      heaven, saith the LORD.<BR />
      7 Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of
      Babylon.<BR />
      8 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent
      me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you
      toucheth the apple of his eye.<BR />
      9 For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall
      be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the LORD
      of hosts hath sent me.<BR />
      10 Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and
      I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD.<BR />
      11 And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day,
      and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee,
      and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto
      thee.<BR />
      12 And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land,
      and shall choose Jerusalem again.<BR />

      26 And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise,
      and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem
      unto Gaza, which is desert.<BR />
      27 And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an
      eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians,
      who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem
      for to worship,<BR />
      28 Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the
      prophet.<BR />
      29 Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself
      to this chariot.<BR />
      30 And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet
      Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?<BR />
      31 And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And
      he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.<BR />
      32 The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was
      led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before
      his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:<BR />
      33 In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall
      declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.<BR />
      34 And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of
      whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other
      man?<BR />
      35 Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture,
      and preached unto him Jesus.<BR />
      36 And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water:
      and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me
      to be baptized?<BR />
      37 And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou
      mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ
      is the Son of God.<BR />
      38 And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went
      down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he
      baptized him.<BR />
      39 And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of
      the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more:
      and he went on his way rejoicing.<BR />
      40 But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached
      in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.<BR />
