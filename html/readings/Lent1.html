      Isaiah 58</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and
      show my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their
      sins.<BR />
      2 Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation
      that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their
      God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight
      in approaching to God.<BR />
      3 Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore
      have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold,
      in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your
      labours.<BR />
      4 Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the
      fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to make
      your voice to be heard on high.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor91986"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">5 Is it
      such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his
      soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread
      sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and
      an acceptable day to the LORD?<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor92431"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">6 Is not
      this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness,
      to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free,
      and that ye break every yoke?<BR />
      7 Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring
      the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the
      naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from
      thine own flesh?<BR />
      8 Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine
      health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall
      go before thee; the glory of the LORD shall be thy rearward.<BR />
      9 Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt
      cry, and he shall say, Here I am. If thou take away from the
      midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and
      speaking vanity;<BR />
      10 And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the
      afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy
      darkness be as the noonday:<BR />
      11 And the LORD shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy
      soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like
      a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail
      not.<BR />
      12 And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places:
      thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and
      thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer
      of paths to dwell in.<BR />
      13 If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy
      pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the
      holy of the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing
      thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking
      thine own words:<BR />
      14 Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause
      thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee
      with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD
      hath spoken it.<BR />

      Matthew 6:1-18</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of
      them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in
      heaven.<BR />
      2 Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet
      before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the
      streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you,
      They have their reward.<BR />
      3 But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy
      right hand doeth:<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor98525"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">4 That
      thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret
      himself shall reward thee openly.<BR />
      5 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites
      are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in
      the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily
      I say unto you, They have their reward.<BR />
      6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when
      thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret;
      and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.<BR />
      7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen
      do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.<BR />
      8 Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth
      what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.<BR />
      9 After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in
      heaven, Hallowed be thy name.<BR />
      10 Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.<BR />
      11 Give us this day our daily bread.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor100664"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">12 And
      forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.<BR />
      13 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil:
      For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever.
      Amen.<BR />
      14 For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father
      will also forgive you:<BR />
      15 But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your
      Father forgive your trespasses.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor101736"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">16 Moreover
      when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance:
      for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men
      to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.<BR />
      17 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy
      face;<BR />
      18 That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father
      which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall
      reward thee openly.<BR />

      Jeremiah 17:5-14</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      5 Thus saith the LORD; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man,
      and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the
      LORD.<BR />
      6 For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not
      see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in
      the wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited.<BR />
      7 Blessed is the man that trusteth in the LORD, and whose hope
      the LORD is.<BR />
      8 For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth
      out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh,
      but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the
      year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.<BR />
      9 The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked:
      who can know it?<BR />
      10 I the LORD search the heart, I try the reins, even to give
      every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of
      his doings.<BR />
      11 As the partridge sitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not; so
      he that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them in
      the midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool.<BR />
      12 A glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of
      our sanctuary.<BR />
      13 O LORD, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be
      ashamed, and they that depart from me shall be written in the
      earth, because they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of living
      waters.<BR />

      1 Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant,
      how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed
      through the sea;<BR />
      2 And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;<BR />
      3 And did all eat the same spiritual meat;<BR />
      4 And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank
      of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was
      Christ.<BR />
      5 But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were
      overthrown in the wilderness.<BR />
      6 Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should
      not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor121757"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">7 Neither

      and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.<BR />

      world are come.<BR />

      Genesis 24:1-27</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD
      had blessed Abraham in all things.<BR />
      </FONT><A NAME="anchor132626"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">2 And
      Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled
      over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:<BR />
      3 And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven,
      and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto
      my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:<BR />
      4 But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take
      a wife unto my son Isaac.<BR />
      5 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will
      not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring
      thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?<BR />
      6 And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not
      my son thither again.<BR />
      7 The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house,
      and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and
      that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land;
      he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife
      unto my son from thence.<BR />
      8 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou
      shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither
      again.<BR />
      9 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his
      master, and sware to him concerning that matter.<BR />
      10 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master,
      and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand:
      and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.<BR />
      11 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a
      well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that
      women go out to draw water.<BR />
      12 And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee,
      send me good speed this day, and show kindness unto my master
      Abraham.<BR />
      13 Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters
      of the men of the city come out to draw water:<BR />
      14 And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say,
      Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she
      shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let
      the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac;
      and thereby shall I know that thou hast shown kindness unto my
      master.<BR />
      15 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold,
      Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the
      wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.<BR />
      16 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither
      had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled
      her pitcher, and came up.<BR />
      17 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray
      thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.<BR />
      18 And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down
      her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.<BR />
      19 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw
      water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.<BR />
      20 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and
      ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.<BR />
      21 And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether
      the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.<BR />
      22 And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that
      the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two
      bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;<BR />
      23 And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is
      there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?<BR />
      24 And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son
      of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.<BR />
      25 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender
      enough, and room to lodge in.<BR />
      26 And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.<BR />
      27 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham,
      who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth:
      I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's
      brethren.<BR />

      1 And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his
      birth.<BR />
      2 And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this
      man, or his parents, that he was born blind?<BR />
      3 Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents:
      but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.<BR />
      4 I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day:
      the night cometh, when no man can work.<BR />
      5 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.<BR />
      6 When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay
      of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with
      the clay,<BR />

      and came seeing.<BR />
      8 The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him
      that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?<BR />
      9 Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he
      said, I am he.<BR />
      10 Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?<BR />
      11 He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay,
      and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam,
      and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.<BR />
      12 Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.<BR />
      13 They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.<BR />
      14 And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened
      his eyes.<BR />
      15 Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received
      his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and
      I washed, and do see.<BR />
      16 Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God,
      because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can
      a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division
      among them.<BR />
      17 They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him,
      that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.<BR />
      18 But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been
      blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents
      of him that had received his sight.<BR />
      19 And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say
      was born blind? how then doth he now see?<BR />
      20 His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our
      son, and that he was born blind:<BR />
      21 But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened
      his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak
      for himself.<BR />

      words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the
      Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he

      32 And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels,

      33 And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will

      36 And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she

      18 When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou
      givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from

      in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.<BR />
      19 Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness,
      nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou
      hast delivered thy soul.<BR />
      20 Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness,
      and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he
      shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall
      die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall
      not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.<BR />
      21 Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous
      sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he
      is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.<BR />

      who is the image of God, should shine unto them.<BR />
      5 For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and
      ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.<BR />
      6 For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness,
      hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge
      of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.<BR />
      7 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency
      of the power may be of God, and not of us.<BR />
      8 We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed,
      but not in despair;<BR />
      9 Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;<BR />
      10 Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus,
      that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.<BR />
      11 For we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus'
      sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our
      mortal flesh.<BR />

      1 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<BR />
      2 Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy,
      and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto the shepherds;
      Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should
      not the shepherds feed the flocks?<BR />
      3 Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them
      that are fed: but ye feed not the flock.<BR />
      4 The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed
      that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was
      broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away,
      neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and
      with cruelty have ye ruled them.<BR />
      5 And they were scattered, because there is no shepherd: and
      they became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they were
      scattered.<BR />
      6 My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every
      high hill: yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the
      earth, and none did search or seek after them.<BR />
      7 Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;<BR />
      8 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely because my flock became
      a prey, and my flock became meat to every beast of the field,
      because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search
      for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my
      flock;<BR />
      9 Therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;<BR />
      10 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against the shepherds;
      and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to
      cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed
      themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth,
      that they may not be meat for them.<BR />
      11 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, will both
      search my sheep, and seek them out.<BR />
      12 As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is
      among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep,
      and will deliver them out of all places where they have been
      scattered in the cloudy and dark day.<BR />
      13 And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them
      from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and
      feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in
      all the inhabited places of the country.<BR />
      14 I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains
      of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good
      fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains
      of Israel.<BR />
      15 I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith
      the Lord GOD.<BR />
      16 I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which
      was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and
      will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat
      and the strong; I will feed them with judgment.<BR />

      17 And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold,
      I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he
      goats.<BR />
      18 Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good
      pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of
      your pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must
      foul the residue with your feet?<BR />
      19 And as for my flock, they eat that which ye have trodden with
      your feet; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your
      feet.<BR />
      20 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD unto them; Behold, I, even
      I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle.<BR />
      21 Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed
      all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them
      abroad;<BR />
      22 Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be
      a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle.<BR />
      23 And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed
      them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall
      be their shepherd.<BR />
      24 And I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David a prince
      among them; I the LORD have spoken it.<BR />

      but the word of God is not bound.<BR />

      21 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the children
      of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be gone, and will
      gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:<BR />
      22 And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains
      of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall
      be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two
      kingdoms any more at all:<BR />
      23 Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols,
      nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions:
      but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces, wherein
      they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my
      people, and I will be their God.<BR />
      24 And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all
      shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments,
      and observe my statutes, and do them.<BR />
      25 And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob
      my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell
      therein, even they, and their children, and their children's
      children for ever: and my servant David shall be their prince
      for ever.<BR />
      26 Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall
      be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them,
      and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of
      them for evermore.<BR />
      27 My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their
      God, and they shall be my people.<BR />
      28 And the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel,
      when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.<BR />

      we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can

      9 But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare,
      and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction
      and perdition.<BR />
      10 For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while

      thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before
      many witnesses.<BR />
      13 I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all
      things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed
      a good confession;<BR />
      14 That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukeable,
      until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:<BR />

      man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to
      whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen.<BR />
      17 Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not
      highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living
      God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;<BR />
      18 That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready
      to distribute, willing to communicate;<BR />
