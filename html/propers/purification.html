      <P>ALMIGHTY and everliving God, we humbly beseech thy Majesty,
      that, as thy only-begotten Son was this day presented in the
      temple in substance of our flesh, so we may be presented unto
      thee with pure and clean hearts, by the same thy Son Jesus Christ
      our Lord. Amen.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>For the Epistle. Malachi iii. 1.</CENTER></P>

      <P>BEHOLD, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the
      way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come
      to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight
      in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts. But who may
      abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth?
      for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' sope: and
      he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall
      purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that
      they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness. Then
      shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the
      LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years. And I will
      come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against
      the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false
      swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his
      wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the
      stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>The Gospel. St. Luke ii. 22.</CENTER></P>

      <P>AND when the days of her purification according to the law
      of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to
      present him to the Lord; (as it is written in the law of the
      Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to
      the Lord;) and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is
      said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtle-doves, or two young
      pigeons. And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name
      was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for
      the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him. And
      it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not
      see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ. And he came
      by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in
      the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law, then
      took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said, Lord,
      now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy
      word: for mine eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou hast
      prepared before the face of all people; a light to lighten the
      Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel. And Joseph and
      his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.
      And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold,
      this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel;
      and for a sign which shall be spoken against; (yea, a sword shall
      pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many
      hearts may be revealed. And there was one Anna, a prophetess,
      the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great
      age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;
      and she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which
      departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and
      prayers night and day. And she coming in that instant gave thanks
      likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked
      for redemption in Jerusalem. And when they had performed all
      things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee,
      to their own city Nazareth. And the child grew, and waxed strong
      in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon
      him.</P>
