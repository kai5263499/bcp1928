    <p>ALMIGHTY God, whose most dear Son went not up to joy but first
      he suffered pain, and entered not into glory before he was crucified;
      Mercifully grant that we, walking in the way of the cross, may
      find it none other than the way of life and peace; through the
      same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<br />

        For the Epistle. Isaiah lxiii. 1.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>WHO is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from
      Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the
      greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty
      to save. Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments
      like him that treadeth in the winefat? I have trodden the winepress
      alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread
      them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood
      shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my
      raiment. For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year
      of my redeemed is come. And I looked, and there was none to help;
      and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine
      own arm brought salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me.
      And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them
      drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the
      earth. I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, and the
      praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed
      on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which
      he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according
      to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses. For he said, Surely
      they are my people, children that will not lie: so he was their
      Saviour. In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel
      of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed
      them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.
      But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit; therefore he was
      turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them. Then he
      remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people, saying, Where
      is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of
      his flock? where is he that put his holy Spirit within him? that
      led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm, dividing
      the water before them, to make himself an everlasting name? that
      led them through the deep, as an horse in the wilderness, that
      they should not stumble? As a beast goeth down into the valley,
      the Spirit of the LORD caused him to rest: so didst thou lead
      thy people, to make thyself a glorious name. Look down from heaven,
      and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory:
      where is thy zeal and thy strength, the sounding of thy bowels
      and of thy mercies toward me? are they restrained? Doubtless
      thou art our father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel
      acknowledge us not: thou, O LORD, art our father, our redeemer;
      thy name is from everlasting. O LORD, why hast thou made us to
      err from thy ways, and hardened our heart from thy fear? Return
      for thy servants' sake, the tribes of thine inheritance. The
      people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while:
      our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary. We are thine:
      thou never barest rule over them; they were not called by thy
      name.<br />

        The Gospel. St. Mark xiv. 1.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>AFTER two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened
      bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they
      might take him by craft, and put him to death. But they said,
      Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of the people.
      And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat
      at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment
      of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured
      it on his head. And there were some that had indignation within
      themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?
      for it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence,
      and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her.
      And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought
      a good work on me. For ye have the poor with you always, and
      whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.
      She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint
      my body to the burying. Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this
      gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also
      that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.
      And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests,
      to betray him unto them. And when they heard it, they were glad,
      and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently
      betray him. And the first day of unleavened bread, when they
      killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt
      thou that we go arid prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?
      And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them,
      Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a
      pitcher of water: follow him. And wheresoever he shall go in,
      say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is
      the guest-chamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?
      And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared:
      there make ready for us. And his disciples went forth, and came
      into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made
      ready the passover. And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.
      And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you,
      One of you which eateth with me shall betray me. And they began
      to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and
      another said, Is it I? And he answered and said unto them, It
      is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish. The Son
      of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that
      man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that
      man if he had never been born. And as they did eat, Jesus took
      bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said,
      Take, eat: this is my body. And he took the cup, and when he
      had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it.
      And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament,
      which is shed for many. Verily I say unto you, I will drink no
      more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it
      new in the kingdom of God. And when they had sung an hymn, they
      went out into the mount of Olives. And Jesus saith unto them,
      All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is
      written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.
      But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.
      But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet
      will not I. And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee,
      That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice,
      thou shalt deny me thrice. But he spake the more vehemently,
      If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise.
      Likewise also said they all. And they came to a place which was
      named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here,
      while I shall pray. And he taketh with him Peter and James and
      John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy; and
      saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry
      ye here, and watch. And he went forward a little, and fell on
      the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might
      pass from him. And he said. Abba, Father, all things are possible
      unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what
      I will, but what thou wilt. And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping,
      and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou
      watch one hour? Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.
      The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak. And again he
      went away, and prayed, and spake the same words. And when he
      returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,)
      neither wist they what to answer him. And he cometh the third
      time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest:
      it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed
      into the hands of sinners. Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth
      me is at hand. And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas,
      one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords
      and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
      And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever
      I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely.
      And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and
      saith, Master, master; and kissed him. And they laid their hands
      on him, and took him. And one of them that stood by drew a sword,
      and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
      And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against
      a thief, with swords and with staves, to take me? I was daily
      with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the
      scriptures must be fulfilled. And they all forsook him, and fled.
      And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth
      cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:
      and he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked. And they
      led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled
      all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes. And Peter
      followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest:
      and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.
      And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness
      against Jesus to put him to death; and found none. For many bare
      false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.
      And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him,
      saying, We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is
      made with hands, and within three days I will build another made
      without hands. But neither so did their witness agree together.
      And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying,
      Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against
      thee? But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the
      high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ,
      the Son of the Blessed? And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see
      the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming
      in the clouds of heaven. Then the high priest rent his clothes,
      and saith, What need we any further witnesses? ye have heard
      the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be
      guilty of death. And some began to spit on him, and to cover
      his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and
      the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands. And
      as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids
      of the high priest: and when she saw Peter warming himself, she
      looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.
      But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what
      thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.
      And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood
      by, This is one of them. And he denied it again. And a little
      after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art
      one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth
      thereto. But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not
      this man of whom ye speak. And the second time the cock crew.
      And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before
      the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought
      thereon, he wept.
