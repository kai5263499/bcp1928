    <p>ALMIGHTY God, who hast given us thy only-begotten Son to take
      our nature upon him, and as at this time to be born of a pure
      virgin; Grant that we being regenerate, and made thy children
      by adoption and grace, may daily be renewed by thy Holy Spirit;
      through the same our Lord Jesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth
      with thee and the same Spirit ever, one God, world without end.
      Amen.<br />

        The Epistle. Galatians iv. 1.

    </p>
    <p>NOW I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth
      nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; but is under
      tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.
      Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the
      elements of the world: but when the fulness of the time was come,
      God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,
      to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive
      the adoption of sons. And because ye are sons, God hath sent
      forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.
      Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son,
      then an heir of God through Christ.<br />

        The Gospel. St. Matthew i. 18.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>THE birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother
      Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was
      found with child of the Holy Ghost. Then Joseph her husband,
      being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example,
      was minded to put her away privily. But while he thought on these
      things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a
      dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto
      thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of
      the Holy Ghost. And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt
      call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their
      sins. Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which
      was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Behold, a virgin
      shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall
      call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with
      us. Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the
      Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife: and knew her
      not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called
      his name JESUS.</p>
