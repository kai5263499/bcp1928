      <P>GRANT, O merciful God, that, as thine holy Apostle Saint James,
      leaving his father and all that he had, without delay was obedient
      unto the calling of thy Son Jesus Christ, and followed him; so
      we, forsaking all worldly and carnal affections, may be evermore
      ready to follow thy holy commandments; through the same Jesus
      Christ our Lord. Amen.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>For the Epistle. Acts xi. 27, and part of Chap. xii.</CENTER></P>

      <P>IN these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch. And
      there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the
      spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world:
      which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar. Then the disciples,
      every man according to his ability, determined to send relief
      unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea: which also they did,
      and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.
      Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands
      to vex certain of the church. And he killed James the brother
      of John with the sword. And because he saw it pleased the Jews,
      he proceeded further to take Peter also.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>The Gospel. St. Matthew xx. 20.</CENTER></P>

      <P>THEN came to him the mother of Zebedee's children with her
      sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him. And
      he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that
      these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the
      other on the left, in thy kingdom. But Jesus answered and said,
      Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that
      I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I
      am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able. And he saith
      unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with
      the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand,
      and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to
      them for whom it is prepared of my Father. And when the ten heard
      it, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren.
      But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes
      of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are
      great exercise authority upon them. But it shall not be so among
      you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;
      and whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:
      even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
      minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</P>
