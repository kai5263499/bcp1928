    <p>GRANT, O Lord, we beseech thee, that the course of this world
      may be so peaceably ordered by thy governance, that thy Church
      may joyfully serve thee in all godly quietness; through Jesus
      Christ our Lord. Amen.<br />

        The Epistle. 1 St. Peter iii. 8.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>BE ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love
      as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous: not rendering evil for
      evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing
      that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.
      For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain
      his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:
      let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue
      it. For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his
      ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is
      against them that do evil. And who is he that will harm you,
      if ye be followers of that which is good? But and if ye suffer
      for righteousness' sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their
      terror, neither be troubled; but sanctify the Lord God in your
      hearts.<br />

        The Gospel. St. Luke v. 1.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>IT came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear
      the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret, and saw
      two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out
      of them, and were washing their nets. And he entered into one
      of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would
      thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught
      the people out of the ship. Now when he had left speaking, he
      said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your
      nets for a draught. And Simon answering said unto him, Master,
      we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless
      at thy word I will let down the net. And when they had this done,
      they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake.
      And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other
      ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and
      filled both the ships, so that they began to sink. When Simon
      Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from
      me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord. For he was astonished, and
      all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they
      had taken: and so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee,
      which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear
      not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men. And when they had
      brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him.</p>
