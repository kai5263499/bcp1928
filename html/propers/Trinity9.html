    <p>GRANT to us, Lord, we beseech thee, the spirit to think and
      do always such things as are right; that we, who cannot do any
      thing that is good without thee, may by thee be enabled to live
      according to thy will; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<br />

        The Epistle. 1 Corinthians x. 1.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>BRETHREN, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that
      all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through
      the sea; and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in
      the sea; and did all eat the same spiritual meat; and did all
      drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual
      Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ. But with many
      of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in
      the wilderness. Now these things were our examples, to the intent
      we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted. Neither
      be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The
      people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. Neither
      let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell
      in one day three and twenty thousand. Neither let us tempt Christ,
      as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents.
      Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed
      of the destroyer. Now all these things happened unto them for
      ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom
      the ends of the world are come. Wherefore let him that thinketh
      he standeth take heed lest he fall. There hath no temptation
      taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful,
      who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able;
      but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that
      ye may be able to bear it.<br />

        The Gospel. St. Luke xv. 11.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>JESUS said, A certain man had two sons: and the younger of
      them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods
      that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living. And
      not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and
      took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance
      with riotous living. And when he had spent all, there arose a
      mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want. And he
      went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he
      sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he would fain have
      filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no
      man gave unto him. And when he came to himself, he said, How
      many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare,
      and I perish with hunger ! I will arise and go to my father,
      and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven,
      and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son:
      make me as one of thy hired servants. And he arose, and came
      to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father
      saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and
      kissed him. And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned
      against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be
      called thy son. But the father said to his servants, Bring forth
      the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand,
      and shoes on his feet: and bring hither the fatted calf, and
      kill it; and let us eat, and be merry: for this my son was dead,
      and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began
      to be merry. Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came
      and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing. And
      he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.
      And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath
      killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and
      sound. And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came
      his father out, and intreated him. And he answering said to his
      father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed
      I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a
      kid, that I might make merry with my friends: but as soon as
      this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots,
      thou hast killed for him the fatted calf. And he said unto him,
      Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine. It
      was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy
      brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.</p>
