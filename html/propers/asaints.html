      <P>ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, who dost enkindle the name of
      thy love in the hearts of the Saints; Grant to us, thy humble
      servants, the same faith and power of love; that, as we rejoice
      in their triumphs, we may profit by their examples; through Jesus
      Christ our Lord. Amen.</P>

      <H6><CENTER><I><BR />
      &para; Or this.</I></CENTER></H6>

      <P><BR />
      O ALMIGHTY God, who hast called us to faith in thee, and hast
      compassed us about with so great a cloud of witnesses; Grant
      that we, encouraged by the good examples of thy Saints, and especially
      of thy servant [Saint_____], may persevere in running the race
      that is set before us, until at length, through thy mercy, we,
      with them, attain to thine eternal joy; through him who is the
      author and finisher of our faith, thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
      Amen.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>The Epistle. Hebrews xii. 1.</CENTER></P>

      <P>SEEING we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of
      witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth
      so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that
      is set before us, looking unto Jesus the author and finisher
      of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured
      the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right
      hand of the throne of God.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>The Gospel. St. Matthew xxv. 31.</CENTER></P>

      <P>WHEN the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy
      angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:
      and before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate
      them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from
      the goats: and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but
      the goats on the left. Then shall the King say unto them on his
      right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom
      prepared for you from the foundation of the world: for I was
      an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me
      drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: naked, and ye clothed
      me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came
      unto me. Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when
      saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee
      drink? When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked,
      and clothed thee? Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and
      came unto thee? And the King shall answer and say unto them,
      Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of
      the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</P>
