    <p>ALMIGHTY God, who madest thy blessed Son to be circumcised,
      and obedient to the law for man; Grant us the true circumcision
      of the Spirit; that, our hearts, and all our members, being mortified
      from all worldly and carnal lusts, we may in all things obey
      thy blessed will; through the same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
      Amen.<br />

        The Epistle. Philippians ii. 9.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>GOD also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which
      is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should
      bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under
      the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ
      is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. Wherefore, my beloved,
      as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now
      much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear
      and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will
      and to do of his good pleasure.<br />

    <p>AND it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them
      into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go
      even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass,
      which the Lord hath made known unto us. And they came with haste,
      and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger. And
      when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which
      was told them concerning this child. And all they that heard
      it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.
      But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.
      And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all
      the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto
      them. And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising
      of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of
      the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</p>
