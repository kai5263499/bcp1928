      <P>O ALMIGHTY God, who by thy blessed Son didst call Matthew
      from the receipt of custom to be an Apostle and Evangelist; Grant
      us grace to forsake all covetous desires, and inordinate love
      of riches, and to follow the same thy Son Jesus Christ, who liveth
      and reigneth with thee and the Holy Ghost, one God, world without
      end. Amen.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>The Epistle. 2 Corinthians iv. 1.</CENTER></P>

      <P>THEREFORE seeing we have this ministry, as we have received
      mercy, we faint not; but have renounced the hidden things of
      dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word
      of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending
      ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God. But
      if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: in whom
      the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe
      not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is
      the image of God, should shine unto them. For we preach not ourselves,
      but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus'
      sake. For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness,
      hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge
      of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>The Gospel. St. Matthew ix. 9.</CENTER></P>

      <P>AND as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named
      Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto
      him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him. And it came to
      pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans
      and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples. And
      when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why
      eateth your Master with publicans and sinners? But when Jesus
      heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a
      physician, but they that are sick. But go ye and learn what that
      meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come
      to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</P>
