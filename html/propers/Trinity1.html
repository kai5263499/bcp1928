    <p>O GOD, the strength of all those who put their trust in thee;
      Mercifully accept our prayers; and because, through the weakness
      of our mortal nature, we can do no good thing without thee, grant
      us the help of thy grace, that in keeping thy commandments we
      may please thee, both in will and deed; through Jesus Christ
      our Lord. Amen.<br />

        The Epistle. 1 St. John iv. 7.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>BELOVED, let us love one another: for love is of God; and
      every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that
      loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love. In this was manifested
      the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only-begotten
      Son into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is
      love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his
      Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved
      us, we ought also to love one another. No man hath seen God at
      any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his
      love is perfected in us. Hereby know we that we dwell in him,
      and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. And we
      have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the
      Saviour of the world. Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the
      Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. And we have known
      and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he
      that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. Herein
      is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day
      of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world. There
      is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because
      fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.
      We love him, because he first loved us. If a man say, I love
      God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth
      not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he
      hath not seen? And this commandment have we from him, That he
      who loveth God love his brother also.<br />

        The Gospel. St. Luke xvi. 19.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>THERE was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple
      and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day: and there was
      a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full
      of sores, and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from
      the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.
      And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by
      the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and
      was buried; and in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments,
      and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. And he
      cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus,
      that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue;
      for I am tormented in this flame. But Abraham said, Son, remember
      that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise
      Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.
      And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf
      fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot;
      neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence. Then
      he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send
      him to my father's house: for I have five brethren; that he may
      testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.
      Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let
      them hear them. And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one
      went unto them from the dead, they will repent. And he said unto
      him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they
      be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.</p>
