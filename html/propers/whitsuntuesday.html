      <P>GRANT, we beseech thee, merciful God, that thy Church, being
      gathered together in unity by thy Holy Spirit, may manifest thy
      power among all peoples, to the glory of thy Name; through Jesus
      Christ our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the same
      Spirit, one God, world without end. Amen.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>For the Epistle. Acts viii. 14.</CENTER></P>

      <P>WHEN the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria
      had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:
      who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might
      receive the Holy Ghost: for as yet he was fallen upon none of
      them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
      Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy
      Ghost.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>The Gospel. St. John x. 1.</CENTER></P>

      <P>VERILY, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the
      door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the
      same is a thief and a robber. But he that entereth in by the
      door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the porter openeth;
      and the sheep hear his voice; and he calleth his own sheep by
      name, and leadeth them out. And when he putteth forth his own
      sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they
      know his voice. And a stranger will they not follow, but will
      flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers. This
      parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things
      they were which he spake unto them. Then said Jesus unto them
      again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.
      All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the
      sheep did not hear them. I am the door: by me if any man enter
      in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.
      The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy:
      I am come that they might have life, and that they might have
      it more abundantly.</P>
