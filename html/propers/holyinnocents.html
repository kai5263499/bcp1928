    <p>O ALMIGHTY God, who out of the mouths of babes and sucklings
      hast ordained strength, and madest infants to glorify thee by
      their deaths; Mortify and kill all vices in us, and so strengthen
      us by thy grace, that by the innocency of our lives, and constancy
      of our faith even unto death, we may glorify thy holy Name; through
      Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<br />

    <p>I LOOKED, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with
      him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name
      written in their foreheads. And I heard a voice from heaven,
      as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder:
      and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps: and
      they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before
      the four living creatures, and the elders: and no man could learn
      that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which
      were redeemed from the earth. These are they which were not defiled
      with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow
      the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among
      men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb. And in their
      mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the
      throne of God.<br />

    <p>THE angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying,
      Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into
      Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will
      seek the young child to destroy him. When he arose, he took the
      young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:
      and was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled
      which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt
      have I called my son. Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked
      of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew
      all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts
      thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time
      which he had diligently enquired of the wise men. Then was fulfilled
      that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, In Rama
      was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great
      mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted,
      because they are not.</p>
