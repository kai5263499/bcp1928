      <P>SEND, we beseech thee, Almighty God, thy Holy Spirit into
      our hearts, that he may direct and rule us according to thy will,
      comfort us in all our afflictions, defend us from all error,
      and lead us into all truth; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who
      with thee and the same Holy Spirit liveth and reigneth, one God,
      world without end. Amen.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>For the Epistle. Acts x. 34.</CENTER></P>

      <P>THEN Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive
      that God is no respecter of persons: but in every nation he that
      feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.
      The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching
      peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:) that word, I say,
      ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began
      from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached; how God
      anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power:
      who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed
      of the devil; for God was with him. And we are witnesses of all
      things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem;
      whom they slew and hanged on a tree: him God raised up the third
      day, and shewed him openly; not to all the people, but unto witnesses
      chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with
      him after he rose from the dead. And he commanded us to preach
      unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained
      of God to be the Judge of quick and dead. To him give all the
      prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in
      him shall receive remission of sins. While Peter yet spake these
      words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.
      And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished,
      as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also
      was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost. For they heard them
      speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter, Can
      any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which
      have received the Holy Ghost as well as we? And he commanded
      them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they
      him to tarry certain days.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>The Gospel. St. John iii. 16.</CENTER></P>

      <P>GOD so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son,
      that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
      life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the
      world; but that the world through him might be saved. He that
      believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not
      is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name
      of the only-begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation,
      that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather
      than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that
      doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest
      his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh
      to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they
      are wrought in God.</P>
