    <p>ASSIST us mercifully with thy help, O Lord God of our salvation;
      that we may enter with joy upon the meditation of those mighty
      acts, whereby thou hast given unto us life and immortality; through
      Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<br />

        The Epistle. Hebrews ix. 16.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>WHERE a testament is, there must also of necessity be the
      death of the testator. For a testament is of force after men
      are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator
      liveth. Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without
      blood. For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people
      according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats,
      with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both
      the book and all the people, saying, This is the blood of the
      testament which God hath enjoined unto you. Moreover, he sprinkled
      with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.
      And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without
      shedding of blood is no remission. It was therefore necessary
      that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified
      with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices
      than these. For Christ is not entered into the holy places made
      with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven
      itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us: nor yet
      that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth
      into the holy place every year with blood of others; for then
      must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world:
      but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put
      away sin by the sacrifice of himself. And as it is appointed
      unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: so Christ
      was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that
      look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto
      salvation.<br />

        The Gospel. St. Luke xxii. 1.

    </p>
    <p>NOW the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called
      the Passover. And the chief priests and scribes sought how they
      might kill him; for they feared the people. Then entered Satan
      into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.
      And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and
      captains, how he might betray him unto them. And they were glad,
      and covenanted to give him money. And he promised, and sought
      opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude.
      Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must
      be killed. And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare
      us the passover, that we may eat. And they said unto him, Where
      wilt thou that we prepare? And he said unto them, Behold, when
      ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing
      a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth
      in. And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master
      saith unto thee, Where is the guest-chamber, where I shall eat
      the passover with my disciples? And he shall shew you a large
      upper room furnished: there make ready. And they went, and found
      as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover. And
      when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles
      with him. And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to
      eat this passover with you before I suffer: for I say unto you,
      I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the
      kingdom of God. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said,
      Take this, and divide it among yourselves: for I say unto you,
      I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom
      of God shall come. And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake
      it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given
      for you: this do in remembrance of me. Likewise also the cup
      after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood,
      which is shed for you. But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth
      me is with me on the table. And truly the Son of man goeth, as
      it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!
      And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it
      was that should do this thing. And there was also a strife among
      them, which of them should be accounted the greatest. And he
      said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over
      them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors.
      But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let
      him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth
      serve. For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he
      that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among
      you as he that serveth.. Ye are they which have continued with
      me in my temptations. And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my
      Father hath appointed unto me; that ye may eat and drink at my
      table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes
      of Israel. And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath
      desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have
      prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not; and when thou art converted,
      strengthen thy brethren. And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready
      to go with thee, both into prison, and to death. And he said,
      I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before
      that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me. And he said
      unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes,
      lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing. Then said he unto
      them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise
      his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment,
      and buy one. For I say unto you, that this that is written must
      yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors:
      for the things concerning me have an end. And they said, Lord,
      behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.
      And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives;
      and his disciples also followed him. And when he was at the place,
      he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation. And
      he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled
      down, and prayed, saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove
      this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.
      And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening
      him. And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his
      sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the
      ground. And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his
      disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow, and said unto them,
      Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. And
      while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called
      Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto
      Jesus to kiss him. But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest
      thou the Son of man with a kiss? When they which were about him
      saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite
      with the sword? And one of them smote the servant of the high
      priest, and cut off his right ear. And Jesus answered and said,
      Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him. Then
      Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple,
      and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against
      a thief, with swords and staves? When I was daily with you in
      the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this
      is your hour, and the power of darkness. Then took they him,
      and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And
      Peter followed afar off. And when they had kindled a fire in
      the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat
      down among them. But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the
      fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also
      with him. And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not. And
      after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also
      of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not. And about the space of
      one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth
      this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean. And Peter
      said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while
      he yet spake, the cock crew. And the Lord turned, and looked
      upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he
      had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.
      And Peter went out, and wept bitterly. And the men that held
      Jesus mocked him, and smote him. And when they had blindfolded
      him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy,
      who is it that smote thee? And many other things blasphemously
      spake they against him. And as soon as it was day, the elders
      of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together,
      and led him into their council, saying, Art thou the Christ?
      tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:
      and if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.
      Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power
      of God. Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And
      he said unto them, Ye say that I am. And they said, What need
      we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own
      mouth.</p>
