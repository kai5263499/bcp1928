    <p>O GOD, who as at this time didst teach the hearts of thy faithful
      people, by sending to them the light of thy Holy Spirit; Grant
      us by the same Spirit to have a right judgment in all things,
      and evermore to rejoice in his holy comfort; through the merits
      of Christ Jesus our Saviour, who liveth and reigneth with thee,
      in the unity of the same Spirit, one God, world without end.

        For the Epistle. Acts ii. 1.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>WHEN the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with
      one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from
      heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house
      where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven
      tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they
      were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with
      other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. And there were
      dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under
      heaven. Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together,
      and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak
      in his own language. And they were all amazed and marvelled,
      saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak
      Galilaeans? And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein
      we were born? Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers
      in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and
      Asia, Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya
      about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes, Cretes
      and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful
      works of God.<br />

        The Gospel. St. John xiv. 15.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>JESUS said unto his disciples, If ye love me, keep my commandments.
      And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter,
      that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of truth;
      whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither
      knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall
      be in you. I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.
      Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see
      me: because I live, ye shall live also. At that day ye shall
      know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you. He that
      hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth
      me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I
      will love him, and will manifest myself to him. Judas saith unto
      him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself
      unto us, and not unto the world? Jesus answered and said unto
      him, If a man love me, he will keep my words; and my Father will
      love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with
      him. He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word
      which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me. These
      things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you. But
      the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will
      send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all
      things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.
      Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the
      world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled,
      neither let it be afraid. Ye have heard how I said unto you,
      I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would
      rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father
      is greater than I. And now I have told you before it come to
      pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe. Hereafter
      I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh,
      and hath nothing in me. But that the world may know that I love
      the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I
      do.</p>

    <p>ALMIGHTY and most merciful God, grant, we beseech thee, that
      by the indwelling of thy Holy Spirit, we may be enlightened and

        The Epistle. 1 Corinthians xii. 4.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>NOW there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. And
      there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.
      And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God
      which worketh all in all. But the manifestation of the Spirit
      is given to every man to profit withal. For to one is given by
      the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge
      by the same Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit; to another
      the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; to another the working
      of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits;
      to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation
      of tongues: but all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit,
      dividing to every man severally as he will. For as the body is
      one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body,
      being many, are one body: so also is Christ. For by one Spirit
      are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles,
      whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into
      one Spirit. For the body is not one member, but many.<br />

        The Gospel. St. Luke xi. 9.

    </p>
    <p>JESUS said to his disciples, Ask, and it shall be given you;
      seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.
      For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth;
      and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. If a son shall ask
      bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone?
      or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent? or
      if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? If ye then,
      being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how
      much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to
      them that ask him?</p>
