      <P>O ALMIGHTY God, whom truly to know is everlasting life; Grant
      us perfectly to know thy Son Jesus Christ to be the way, the
      truth, and the life; that, following the steps of thy holy Apostles,
      Saint Philip and Saint James, we may stedfastly walk in the way
      that leadeth to eternal life; through the same thy Son Jesus
      Christ our Lord. Amen.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>The Epistle. St. James i. 1.</CENTER></P>

      <P>JAMES, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the
      twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting. My brethren,
      count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; knowing
      this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience. But let
      patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire,
      wanting nothing. If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God,
      that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it
      shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering.
      For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the
      wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive
      any thing of the Lord. A double-minded man is unstable in all
      his ways. Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is
      exalted: but the rich, in that he is made low: because as the
      flower of the grass he shall pass away. For the sun is no sooner
      risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the
      flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth:
      so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways. Blessed is
      the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall
      receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them
      that love him.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>The Gospel. St. John xiv. 1.</CENTER></P>

      <P>AND Jesus said unto his disciples, Let not your heart be troubled:
      ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father's house are
      many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go
      to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for
      you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where
      I am, there ye may be also. And whither I go ye know, and the
      way ye know. Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither
      thou goest; and how can we know the way? Jesus saith unto him,
      I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the
      Father, but by me. If ye had known me, ye should have known my
      Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.
      Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it suffice
      thus. Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you,
      and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me
      hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?
      Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in
      me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but
      the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. Believe me
      that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe
      me for the very works' sake. Verily, verily, I say unto you,
      He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also;
      and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my
      Father. And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do,
      that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask
      any thing in my name, I will do it.</P>
