      <P>O ALMIGHTY God, who hast instructed thy holy Church with the
      heavenly doctrine of thy Evangelist Saint Mark; Give us grace
      that, being not like children carried away with every blast of
      vain doctrine, we may be established in the truth of thy holy
      Gospel; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<BR />
      </P>

        The Epistle. Ephesians 4:7-16
      </CENTER></P>

      <P>7 But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. <br />
        8 Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. <br />
        9 (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth? <br />
        10 He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.) <br />
        11 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; <br />
        12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: <br />
        13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: <br />
        14 That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; <br />
        15 But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ: <br />
        16 From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love. <BR />

        The Gospel. St. John 15:1 - 11
      </CENTER></P>

      <P>1 I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. <br />
        2 Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit. <br />
        3 Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you. <br />
        4 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. <br />
        5 I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. <br />
        6 If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned. <br />
        7 If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. <br />
        8 Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples. <br />
        9 As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love. <br />
        10 If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father&rsquo;s commandments, and abide in his love. <br />
        11 These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full. </P>
