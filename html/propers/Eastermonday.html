    <p>O GOD, whose blessed Son did manifest himself to his disciples
      in the breaking of bread; Open, we pray thee, the eyes of our
      faith, that we may behold thee in all thy works; through the
      same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<br />

    <p>PETER opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that
      God is no respecter of persons: but in every nation he that feareth
      him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him. The word
      which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by
      Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:) that word, I say, ye know,
      which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee,
      after the baptism which John preached; how God anointed Jesus
      of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about
      doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil;
      for God was with him. And we are witnesses of all things which
      he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they
      slew and hanged on a tree: him God raised up the third day, and
      shewed him openly; not to all the people, but unto witnesses
      chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with
      him after he rose from the dead. And he commanded us to preach
      unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained
      of God to be the Judge of quick and dead. To him give all the
      prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in
      him shall receive remission of sins.<br />

        The Gospel. St. Luke xxiv. 13.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>BEHOLD, two of his disciples went that same day to a village
      called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.
      And they talked together of all these things which had happened.
      And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned,
      Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. But their eyes were
      holden that they should not know him. And he said unto them,
      What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another,
      as ye walk, and are sad? And the one of them, whose name was
      Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in
      Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass
      there in these days? And he said unto them, What things? And
      they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a
      prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:
      and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be
      condemned to death, and have crucified him. But we trusted that
      it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside
      all this, to-day is the third day since these things were done.
      Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished,
      which were early at the sepulchre; and when they found not his
      body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of
      angels, which said that he was alive. And certain of them which
      were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the
      women had said: but him they saw not. Then he said unto them,
      O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have
      spoken: ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to
      enter into his glory? And beginning at Moses and all the prophets,
      he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning
      himself. And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went:
      and he made as though he would have gone further. But they constrained
      him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the
      day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them. And it came
      to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed
      it, and brake, and gave to them. And their eyes were opened,
      and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. And they
      said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while
      he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?
      And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and
      found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,
      saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.
      And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was
      known of them in breaking of bread.
