    <p>ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, who hast given unto us thy servants
      grace, by the confession of a true faith, to acknowledge the
      glory of the eternal Trinity, and in the power of the Divine
      Majesty to worship the Unity; We beseech thee that thou wouldest
      keep us stedfast in this faith, and evermore defend us from all
      adversities, who livest and reignest, one God, world without
      end. Amen.<br />

        For the Epistle. Revelation iv. 1.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>AFTER this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven:
      and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet
      talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew
      thee things which must be hereafter. And immediately I was in
      the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one
      sat on the throne. And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper
      and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the
      throne, in sight like unto an emerald. And round about the throne
      were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and
      twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had
      on their heads crowns of gold. And out of the throne proceeded
      lightnings and thunderings and voices: and there were seven lamps
      of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits
      of God. And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto
      crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the
      throne, were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind.
      And the first was like a lion, and the second like a calf, and
      the third had a face as a man, and the fourth was like a flying
      eagle. And the four living creatures had each of them six wings
      about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not
      day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which
      was, and is, and is to come. And when those living creatures
      give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne,
      who liveth for ever and ever, the four and twenty elders fall
      down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that
      liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne,
      saying, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour
      and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure
      they are, and were created.<br />

        The Gospel. St. John iii. 1.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>THERE was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler
      of the Jews: the same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him,
      Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no
      man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with
      him. Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say
      unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom
      of God. Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when
      he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb,
      and be born? Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
      Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter
      into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh;
      and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that
      I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where
      it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not
      tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one
      that is born of the Spirit. Nicodemus answered and said unto
      him, How can these things be? Jesus answered and said unto him,
      Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things? Verily,
      verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify
      that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness. If I have
      told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe,
      if I tell you of heavenly things? And no man hath ascended up
      to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of
      man which is in heaven. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in
      the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: that
      whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal
      life.</p>
