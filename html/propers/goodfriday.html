      to behold this thy family, for which our Lord Jesus Christ was
      contented to be betrayed, and given up into the hands of wicked
      men, and to suffer death upon the cross; who now liveth and reigneth

        <br />
      ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, by whose Spirit the whole body
      of the Church is governed and sanctified; Receive our supplications
      and prayers, which we offer before thee for all estates of men
      in thy holy Church, that every member of the same, in his vocation
      and ministry, may truly and godly serve thee; through our Lord
      and Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.<br />
        <br />
      MERCIFUL God, who hast made all men, and hatest nothing that
      thou hast made, nor desirest the death of a sinner, but rather
      that he should be converted and live; Have mercy upon all who
      know thee not as thou art revealed in the Gospel of thy Son.
      Take from them all ignorance, hardness of heart, and contempt
      of thy Word; and so fetch them home, blessed Lord, to thy fold,
      that they may be made one flock under one shepherd, Jesus Christ
      our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit,

    <p><font color="#000000">THE law having a shadow of good things
      to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with
      those sacrifices, which they offered year by year continually,
      make the comers thereunto perfect. For then would they not have
      ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged
      should have had no more conscience of sins. But in those sacrifices
      there is a remembrance again made of sins every year. For it
      is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take
      away sins. Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith,
      Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou
      prepared me: in burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast
      had no pleasure. Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the
      book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God. Above when
      he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt-offerings and offering
      for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which
      are offered by the law; then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will,
      O God: he taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.
      By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the
      body of Jesus Christ once for all. And every priest standeth
      daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices,
      which can never take away sins: but this man, after he had offered
      one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of
      God; from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.
      For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are
      sanctified. Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for
      after that he had said before, This is the covenant that I will
      make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my
      laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;
      then saith he, And their sins and iniquities will I remember
      no more. Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering
      for sin. Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the
      holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which
      he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say,
      his flesh; and having an high priest over the house of God; let
      us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having
      our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies
      washed with pure water. Let us hold fast the profession of our
      faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;) and
      let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good
      works: not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as
      the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much
      the more, as ye see the day approaching.<br />

    <p><font color="#000000">PILATE therefore took Jesus, and scourged
      him. And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on
      his head, and they put on him a purple robe, and said, Hail,
      King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands. Pilate
      therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring
      him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.
      Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple
      robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man! When the chief
      priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying,
      Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him,
      and crucify him: for I find no fault in him. The Jews answered
      him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he
      made himself the Son of God. When Pilate therefore heard that
      saying, he was the more afraid; and went again into the judgment
      hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him
      no answer. Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto
      me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have
      power to release thee? Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no
      power at all against me, except it were given thee from above:
      therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.
      And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews
      cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's
      friend: whosoever maketh himself a king, speaketh against Caesar.
      When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth,
      and sat down in the judgment-seat in a place that is called the
      Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha. And it was the preparation
      of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto
      the Jews, Behold your King ! But they cried out, Away with him,
      away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify
      your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.
      Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And
      they took Jesus, and led him away. And he bearing his cross went
      forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called
      in the Hebrew Golgotha: where they crucified him, and two other
      with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst. And Pilate
      wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was,
      JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS. This title then read
      many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was
      nigh to the city; and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and
      Latin. Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write
      not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the
      Jews. Pilate answered, What I have written I have written. Then
      the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments,
      and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat:
      now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
      They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but
      cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might
      be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them,
      and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore
      the soldiers did. Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother,
      and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary
      Magdalene. When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple
      standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman,
      behold thy son ! Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother!
      And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.
      After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished,
      that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst. Now there
      was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with
      vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth. When
      Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished:
      and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost. The Jews therefore,
      because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain
      upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was
      an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken,
      and that they might be taken away. Then came the soldiers, and
      brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified
      with him. But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead
      already, they brake not his legs: but one of the soldiers with
      a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood
      and water. And he that saw it bare record, and his record is
      true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.
      For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled,
      A bone of him shall not be broken. And again another scripture
      saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.</font></p>
