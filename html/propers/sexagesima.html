    <p>O LORD God, who seest that we put not our trust in any thing
      that we do; Mercifully grant that by thy power we may be defended
      against all adversity; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<br />

        The Epistle. 2 Corinthians xi. 19.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>YE suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise. For
      ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you,
      if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite
      you on the face. I speak as concerning reproach, as though we
      had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,)
      I am bold also. Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites?
      so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I. Are they ministers
      of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant,
      in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths
      oft. Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.
      Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered
      shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep; in journeyings
      often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by
      mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the
      city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils
      among false brethren; in weariness and painfulness, in watchings
      often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.
      Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon
      me daily, the care of all the churches. Who is weak, and I am
      not weak? who is offended, and I burn not? If I must needs glory,
      I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities. The
      God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for
      evermore, knoweth that I lie not.<br />

        The Gospel. St. Luke viii. 4.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>WHEN much people were gathered together, and were come to
      him out of every city, he spake by a parable: A sower went out
      to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way-side;
      and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.
      And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it
      withered away, because it lacked moisture. And some fell among
      thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it. And
      other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold.
      And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears
      to hear, let him hear. And his disciples asked him, saying, What
      might this parable be? And he said, Unto you it is given to know
      the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables;
      that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.
      Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. Those by
      the way-side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh
      away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and
      be saved. They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive
      the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while
      believe, and in time of temptation fall away. And that which
      fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth,
      and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life,
      and bring no fruit to perfection. But that on the good ground
      are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the
      word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.</p>
