      <P>O ALMIGHTY God, who by thy Son Jesus Christ didst give to
      thy Apostle Saint Peter many excellent gifts, and commandedst
      him earnestly to feed thy flock; Make, we beseech thee, all Bishops
      and Pastors diligently to preach thy holy Word, and the people
      obediently to follow the same, that they may receive the crown
      of everlasting glory; through the same thy Son Jesus Christ our
      Lord. Amen.<BR />

      <P><CENTER>For the Epistle. Acts xii. 1.</CENTER></P>

      <P>ABOUT that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to
      vex certain of the church. And he killed James the brother of
      John with the sword. And because he saw it pleased the Jews,
      he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days
      of unleavened bread.) And when he had apprehended him, he put
      him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers
      to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the
      people. Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made
      without ceasing of the church unto God for him. And when Herod
      would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping
      between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers
      before the door kept the prison. And, behold, the angel of the
      Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he
      smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up
      quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands. And the angel
      said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so
      he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and
      follow me. And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that
      it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a
      vision. When they were past the first and the second ward, they
      came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened
      to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through
      one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him. And when
      Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that
      the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the
      hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of
      the Jews.<BR />

      <P><CENTER>The Gospel. St. Matthew xvi. 13.</CENTER></P>

      <P>WHEN Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked
      his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man
      am? And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some,
      Elias; and others, Jeremias or one of the prophets. He saith
      unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Simon Peter answered
      and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. And
      Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona:
      for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father
      which is in heaven. And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter,
      and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell
      shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys
      of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
      shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on
      earth shall be loosed in heaven.</P>
