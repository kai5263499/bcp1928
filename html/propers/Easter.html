    <p><br />
      CHRIST our Passover is sacrificed for us: * therefore let us
      keep the feast, Not with old leaven, neither with the leaven
      of malice and wickedness; * but with the unleavened bread of
      sincerity and truth. 1 Cor. v. 7.<br />
        <br />
      CHRIST being raised from the dead dieth no more; * death hath
      no more dominion over him. For in that he died, he died unto
      sin once: * but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. Likewise
      reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, * but alive
      unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Rom. vi. 9.<br />
        <br />
      CHRIST is risen from the dead, * and become the firstfruits of
      them that slept. For since by man came death, * by man came also
      the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, * even
      so in Christ shall all be made alive. 1 Cor. xv. 20.<br />
        <br />
      Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost;
      As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, * world
      without end. Amen.<br />

    <p>THE first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when
      it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken
      away from the sepulchre. Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon
      Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith
      unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre,
      and we know not where they have laid him. Peter therefore went
      forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre. So
      they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter,
      and came first to the sepulchre. And he stooping down, and looking
      in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in. Then cometh
      Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth
      the linen clothes lie, and the napkin, that was about his head,
      not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place
      by itself. Then went in also that other disciple, which came
      first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed. For as yet
      they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the
      dead. Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.</p>

    </p>
    <p>WHEN the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the Mother
      of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might
      come and anoint him. And very early in the morning the first
      day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of
      the sun. And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away
      the stone from the door of the sepulchre? And when they looked,
      they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.
      And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting
      on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they
      were affrighted. And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye
      seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he
      is not here: behold the place where they laid him. But go your
      way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into
      Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you. And they
      went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled
      and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for
      they were afraid.</p>
