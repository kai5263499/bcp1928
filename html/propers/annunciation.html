      <P>WE beseech thee, O Lord, pour thy grace into our hearts; that,
      as we have known the incarnation of thy Son Jesus Christ by the
      message of an angel, so by his cross and passion we may be brought
      unto the glory of his resurrection; through the same Jesus Christ
      our Lord. Amen.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>For the Epistle. Isaiah vii. 10.</CENTER></P>

      <P>MOREOVER the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying, Ask thee
      a sign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in
      the height above. But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will
      I tempt the LORD. And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David;
      Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my
      God also? Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold,
      a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name
      Immanuel. Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to
      refuse the evil, and choose the good.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>The Gospel. St. Luke i. 26.</CENTER></P>

      <P>AND in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God
      unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, to a virgin espoused
      to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the
      virgin's name was Mary. And the angel came in unto her, and said,
      Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed
      art thou among women. And when she saw him, she was troubled
      at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation
      this should be. And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary:
      for thou hast found favour with God. And, behold, thou shalt
      conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his
      name JESUS. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of
      the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne
      of his father David: and he shall reign over the house of Jacob
      for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. Then said
      Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?
      And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall
      come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow
      thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee
      shall be called the Son of God. And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth,
      she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the
      sixth month with her, who was called barren. For with God nothing
      shall be impossible. And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the
      Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed
      from her.</P>
