    <p>ALMIGHTY Father, whose dear Son, on the night before he suffered,
      did institute the Sacrament of his Body and Blood; Mercifully
      grant that we may thankfully receive the same in remembrance
      of him, who in these holy mysteries giveth us a pledge of life
      eternal; the same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who now liveth
      and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit ever, one God, world
      without end. Amen.<br />

    <p>I HAVE received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto
      you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed
      took bread: and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said,
      Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do
      in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the
      cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament
      in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance
      of me. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup,
      ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.<br />

    <p>THE whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate
      . And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow
      perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar,
      saying that he himself is Christ a King. And Pilate asked him,
      saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and
      said, Thou sayest it. Then said Pilate to the chief priests and
      to the people, I find no fault in this man. And they were the
      more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout
      all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place. When Pilate
      heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.
      And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction,
      he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that
      time. And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he
      was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard
      many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done
      by him. Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered
      him nothing. And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently
      accused him. And Herod with his men of war set him at nought,
      and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent
      him again to Pilate. And the same day Pilate and Herod were made
      friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.
      And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and
      the rulers and the people, said unto them, Ye have brought this
      man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold,
      I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this
      man touching those things whereof ye accuse him: no, nor yet
      Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death
      is done unto him. I will therefore chastise him, and release
      him. (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)
      And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and
      release unto us Barabbas: (who for a certain sedition made in
      the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.) Pilate therefore,
      willing to release Jesus, spake again to them. But they cried,
      saying, Crucify him, crucify him. And he said unto them the third
      time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death
      in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go. And they
      were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified.
      And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed. And
      Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required. And
      he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast
      into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to
      their will. And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one
      Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they
      laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus. And there
      followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also
      bewailed and lamented him. But Jesus turning unto them said,
      Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves,
      and for your children. For, behold, the days are coming, in the
      which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that
      never bare, and the paps which never gave suck. Then shall they
      begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills,
      Cover us. For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall
      be done in the dry? And there were also two other, malefactors,
      led with him to be put to death. And when they were come to the
      place which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and
      the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the
      left. Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not
      what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots. And
      the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided
      him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be
      Christ, the chosen of God. And the soldiers also mocked him,
      coming to him, and offering him vinegar, and saying, If thou
      be the king of the Jews, save thyself. And a superscription also
      was written over him, in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew,
      THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. And one of the malefactors which
      were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself
      and us. But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not
      thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? And
      we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds:
      but this man hath done nothing amiss. And he said unto Jesus,
      Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. And Jesus
      said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To-day shalt thou be with
      me in paradise. And it was about the sixth hour, and there was
      a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. And the sun
      was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.
      And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father,
      into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he
      gave up the ghost. Now when the centurion saw what was done,
      he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.
      And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding
      the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.
      And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from
      Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</p>

        The Gospel. St. John xiii. 1.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>NOW before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that
      his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto
      the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he
      loved them unto the end. And supper being ended, the devil having
      now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray
      him; Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into
      his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God; he
      riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel,
      and girded himself. After that he poureth water into a bason,
      and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with
      the towel wherewith he was girded. Then cometh he to Simon Peter:
      and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet? Jesus
      answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but
      thou shalt know hereafter. Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never
      wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast
      no part with me. Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet
      only, but also my hands and my head. Jesus saith to him, He that
      is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every
      whit: and ye are clean, but not all. For he knew who should betray
      him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean. So after he had
      washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down
      again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you? Ye
      call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. If I then,
      your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to
      wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that
      ye should do as I have done to you.</p>
