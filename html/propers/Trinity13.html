    <p>ALMIGHTY and merciful God, of whose only gift it cometh that
      thy faithful people do unto thee true and laudable service; Grant,
      we beseech thee, that we may so faithfully serve thee in this
      life, that we fail not finally to attain thy heavenly promises;
      through the merits of Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<br />

        The Epistle. Galatians iii. 16.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>TO Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not,
      And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which
      is Christ. And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed
      before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and
      thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the
      promise of none effect. For if the inheritance be of the law,
      it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.
      Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions,
      till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it
      was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator. Now a mediator
      is not a mediator of one, but God is one. Is the law then against
      the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law
      given which could have given life, verily righteousness should
      have been by the law. But the scripture hath concluded all under
      sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given
      to them that believe.<br />

        The Gospel. St. Luke x. 23.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>BLESSED are the eyes which see the things that ye see: for
      I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see
      those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear
      those things which ye hear, and have not heard them. And, behold,
      a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what
      shall I do to inherit eternal life? He said unto him, What is
      written in the law? how readest thou? And he answering said,
      Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with
      all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind;
      and thy neighbour as thyself. And he said unto him, Thou hast
      answered right: this do, and thou shalt live. But he, willing
      to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?
      And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem
      to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his
      raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.
      And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and
      when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. And likewise
      a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and
      passed by on the other side. But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed,
      came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on
      him, and went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil
      and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an
      inn, and took care of him. And on the morrow when he departed,
      he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto
      him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when
      I come again, I will repay thee. Which now of these three, thinkest
      thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves? And
      he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him,
      Go, and do thou likewise.</p>
