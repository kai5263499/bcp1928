    <p>GRANT, we beseech thee, Almighty God, that we who celebrate
      with reverence the Paschal feast, may be found worthy to attain
      to everlasting joys; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<br />

        For the Epistle. Acts xiii. 26.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>MEN and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever
      among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.
      For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they
      knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read
      every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.
      And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they
      Pilate that he should be slain. And when they had fulfilled all
      that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and
      laid him in a sepulchre. But God raised him from the dead: and
      he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee
      to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people. And we declare
      unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto
      the fathers, God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children,
      in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written
      in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten
      thee. And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead,
      now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I
      will give you the sure mercies of David. Wherefore he saith also
      in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see
      corruption. For David, after he had served his own generation
      by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers,
      and saw corruption: but he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.
      Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through
      this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: and by
      him all that believe are justified from all things, from which
      ye could not be justified by the law of Moses. Beware therefore,
      lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets;
      Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work
      in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though
      a man declare it unto you.<br />

        The Gospel. St. Luke xxiv. 36.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>JESUS himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them,
      Peace be unto you. But they were terrified and affrighted, and
      supposed that they had seen a spirit. And he said unto them,
      Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?
      Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me,
      and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me
      have. And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and
      his feet. And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered,
      he said unto them, Have ye here any meat? And they gave him a
      piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb. And he took it,
      and did eat before them. And he said unto them, These are the
      words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that
      all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of
      Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.
      Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand
      the scriptures, and said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus
      it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third
      day: and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached
      in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. And ye
      are witnesses of these things.</p>
