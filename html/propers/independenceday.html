      <P>O ETERNAL God, through whose mighty power our fathers won
      their liberties of old; Grant, we beseech thee, that we and all
      the people of this land may have grace to maintain these liberties
      in righteousness and peace; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>For the Epistle. Deuteronomy x. 17.</CENTER></P>

      <P>THE LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great
      God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor
      taketh reward: he doth execute the judgment of the fatherless
      and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.
      Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the
      land of Egypt. Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou
      serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name. He
      is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these
      great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>The Gospel. St. Matthew v. 43.</CENTER></P>

      <P>JESUS said, Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt
      love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you,
      Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them
      that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you,
      and persecute you; that ye may be the children of your Father
      which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil
      and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.
      For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not
      even the publicans the same? And if ye salute your brethren only,
      what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so? Be
      ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven
      is perfect.</P>
