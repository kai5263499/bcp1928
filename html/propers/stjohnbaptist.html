      <P>ALMIGHTY God, by whose providence thy servant John Baptist
      was wonderfully born, and sent to prepare the way of thy Son
      our Saviour by preaching repentance; Make us so to follow his
      doctrine and holy life, that we may truly repent according to
      his preaching; and after his example constantly speak the truth,
      boldly rebuke vice, and patiently suffer for the truth's sake;
      through the same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>For the Epistle. Isaiah xl. 1.</CENTER></P>

      <P>COMFORT ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. Speak ye
      comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare
      is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath
      received of the LORD'S hand double for all her sins. The voice
      of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the
      LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God. Every
      valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be
      made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough
      places plain: and the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and
      all flesh shall see it together: for the mouth of the LORD hath
      spoken it. The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry?
      All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the
      flower of the field: the grass withereth, the flower fadeth:
      because the spirit of the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people
      is grass. The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word
      of our God shall stand for ever. O Zion, that bringest good tidings,
      get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest
      good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be
      not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God! Behold,
      the Lord GOD will come with strong hand, and his arm shall rule
      for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his work before
      him. He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather
      the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall
      gently lead those that are with young.<BR />

      <P><CENTER>The Gospel. St. Luke i. 57.</CENTER></P>

      <P>ELISABETH'S full time came that she should be delivered; and
      she brought forth a son. And her neighbours and her cousins heard
      how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced
      with her. And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came
      to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after
      the name of his father. And his mother answered and said, Not
      so; but he shall be called John. And they said unto her, There
      is none of thy kindred that is called by this name. And they
      made signs to his father, how he would have him called. And he
      asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John.
      And they marvelled all. And his mouth was opened immediately,
      and his tongue loosed, and he spake, and praised God. And fear
      came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings
      were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.
      And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying,
      What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord
      was with him. And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy
      Ghost, and prophesied, saying, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel;
      for he hath visited and redeemed his people, and hath raised
      up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;
      as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been
      since the world began: that we should be saved from our enemies,
      and from the hand of all that hate us; to perform the mercy promised
      to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant; the oath which
      he sware to our father Abraham, that he would grant unto us,
      that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might
      serve him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before
      him, all the days of our life. And thou, child, shalt be called
      the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face
      of the Lord to prepare his ways; to give knowledge of salvation
      unto his people by the remission of their sins, through the tender
      mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited
      us, to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow
      of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace. And the child
      grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till
      the day of his shewing unto Israel.</P>
