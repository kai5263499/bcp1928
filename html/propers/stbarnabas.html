      <P>O LORD God Almighty, who didst endue thy holy Apostle Barnabas
      with singular gifts of the Holy Ghost; Leave us not, we beseech
      thee, destitute of thy manifold gifts, nor yet of grace to use
      them alway to thy honour and glory; through Jesus Christ our
      Lord. Amen.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>For the Epistle. Acts xi. 22.</CENTER></P>

      <P>TIDINGS of these things came unto the ears of the church which
      was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should
      go as far as Antioch. Who, when he came, and had seen the grace
      of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of
      heart they would cleave unto the Lord. For he was a good man,
      and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was
      added unto the Lord. Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to
      seek Saul: and when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch.
      And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves
      with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were
      called Christians first in Antioch. And in these days came prophets
      from Jerusalem unto Antioch. And there stood up one of them named
      Agabus, and signified by the spirit that there should be great
      dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days
      of Claudius Caesar. Then the disciples, every man according to
      his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which
      dwelt in Judaea: which also they did, and sent it to the elders
      by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>The Gospel. St. John xv. 12.</CENTER></P>

      <P>THIS is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have
      loved you. Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay
      down his life for his friends. Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever
      I command you. Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant
      knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends;
      for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known
      unto you. Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained
      you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit
      should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in
      my name, he may give it you.</P>
