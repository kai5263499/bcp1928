    <p>O LORD God, whose blessed Son, our Saviour, gave his back
      to the smiters and hid not his face from shame; Grant us grace
      to take joyfully the sufferings of the present time, in full
      assurance of the glory that shall be revealed; through the same
      thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<br />

    </p>
    <p>THE Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious,
      neither turned away back. I gave my back to the smiters, and
      my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face
      from shame and spitting. For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore
      shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like
      a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed. He is near that
      justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us stand together:
      who is mine adversary? let him come near to me. Behold, the Lord
      GOD will help me; who is he that shall condemn me? lo, they all
      shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up. Who is
      among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice of his
      servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? let him
      trust in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God. Behold,
      all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about with
      sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that
      ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie
      down in sorrow.<br />

    <p>AND straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation
      with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound
      Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate. And
      Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering
      said unto him, Thou sayest it. And the chief priests accused
      him of many things: but he answered nothing. And Pilate asked
      him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things
      they witness against thee. But Jesus yet answered nothing; so
      that Pilate marvelled. Now at that feast he released unto them
      one prisoner, whomsoever they desired. And there was one named
      Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection
      with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection. And the
      multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever
      done unto them. But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that
      I release unto you the King of the Jews? For he knew that the
      chief priests had delivered him for envy. But the chief priests
      moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto
      them. And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will
      ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the
      Jews? And they cried out again, Crucify him. Then Pilate said
      unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the
      more exceedingly, Crucify him. And so Pilate, willing to content
      the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus,
      when he had scourged him, to be crucified. And the soldiers led
      him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together
      the whole band. And they clothed him with purple, and platted
      a crown of thorns, and put it about his head, and began to salute
      him, Hail, King of the Jews! And they smote him on the head with
      a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped
      him. And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from
      him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify
      him. And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming
      out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear
      his cross. And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which
      is, being interpreted, The place of a skull. And they gave him
      to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not. And
      when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting
      lots upon them, what every man should take. And it was the third
      hour, and they crucified him. And the superscription of his accusation
      was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS. And with him they crucify
      two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his
      left. And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was
      numbered with the transgressors. And they that passed by railed
      on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest
      the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself, and
      come down from the cross. Likewise also the chief priests mocking
      said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself
      he cannot save. Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from
      the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified
      with him reviled him. And when the sixth hour was come, there
      was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. And at
      the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi,
      lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God,
      why hast thou forsaken me? And some of them that stood by, when
      they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias. And one ran and
      filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave
      him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will
      come to take him down. And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and
      gave up the ghost. And the veil of the temple was rent in twain
      from the top to the bottom. And when the centurion, which stood
      over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost,
      he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.
