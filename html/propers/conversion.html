    <p>O GOD, who, through the preaching of the blessed Apostle Saint
      Paul, hast caused the light of the Gospel to shine throughout
      the world; Grant, we beseech thee, that we, having his wonderful
      conversion in remembrance, may show forth our thankfulness unto
      thee for the same, by following the holy doctrine which he taught;
      through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<br />

    <p>AND Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against
      the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest, and desired
      of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found
      any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring
      them bound unto Jerusalem. And as he journeyed, he came near
      Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from
      heaven: and he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto
      him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? And he said, Who art
      thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest:
      it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. And he trembling
      and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And
      the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall
      be told thee what thou must do. And the men which journeyed with
      him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man. And
      Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he
      saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into
      Damascus. And he was three days without sight, and neither did
      eat nor drink. And there was a certain disciple at Damascus,
      named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias.
      And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord. And the Lord said unto
      him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight,
      and enquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus:
      for, behold, he prayeth, and hath seen in a vision a man named
      Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might
      receive his sight. Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard
      by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints
      at Jerusalem: and here he hath authority from the chief priests
      to bind all that call on thy name. But the Lord said unto him,
      Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name
      before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel: for
      I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name's
      sake. And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and
      putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus,
      that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent
      me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with
      the Holy Ghost. And immediately there fell from his eyes as it
      had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose,
      and was baptized. And when he had received meat, he was strengthened.
      Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.
      And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he
      is the Son of God. But all that heard him were amazed, and said;
      Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name
      in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might
      bring them bound unto the chief priests? But Saul increased the
      more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus,
      proving that this is very Christ.<br />

    <p>PETER answered and said unto Jesus, Behold, we have forsaken
      all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore? And Jesus
      said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed
      me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the
      throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging
      the twelve tribes of Israel. And every one that hath forsaken
      houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife,
      or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold,
      and shall inherit everlasting life. But many that are first shall
      be last; and the last shall be first.</p>
