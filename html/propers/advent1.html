    <p>ALMIGHTY God, give us grace that we may cast away the works
      of darkness, and put upon us the armour of light, now in the
      time of this mortal life, in which thy Son Jesus Christ came
      to visit us in great humility; that in the last day, when he
      shall come again in his glorious majesty to judge both the quick
      and the dead, we may rise to the life immortal, through him who
      liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Ghost, now and ever.
      Amen.</p>

        The Epistle. Romans xiii. 8.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>OWE no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that
      loveth another hath fulfilled the law. For this, Thou shalt not
      commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou
      shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there
      be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this
      saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. Love
      worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling
      of the law. And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time
      to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when
      we believed. The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let
      us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on
      the armour of light. Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not
      in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness,
      not in strife and envying. But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ,
      and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.<br />

        The Gospel. St. Matthew xxi. 1.

    </p>
    <p>WHEN they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage,
      unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples, saying
      unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway
      ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and
      bring them unto me. And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall
      say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send
      them. All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was
      spoken by the prophet, saying, Tell ye the daughter of Sion,
      Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an
      ass, and a colt the foal of an ass. And the disciples went, and
      did as Jesus commanded them, and brought the ass, and the colt,
      and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon. And
      a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others
      cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way.
      And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried,
      saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh
      in the name 'of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest. And when he
      was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who
      is this? And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of
      Nazareth of Galilee. And Jesus went into the temple of God, and
      cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew
      the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that
      sold doves, and said unto them, It is written, My house shall
      be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves</p>
