      <P>INTROIT. Resurrexi (Psalm 139)<BR />
      I am risen and present with thee, alleluia: Thou hast laid thine
      hand upon me, alleluia.&nbsp; Such knowledge is too wonderful
      and excellent for me.&nbsp; Alleulia, alleluia.&nbsp; Psalm.
      ibid. O Lord, thou hast searched me out and known me: Thou knowest
      my downsitting and mine uprising. V.&nbsp; Glory be.</P>

      <P>THE COLLECT.<BR />
      ALMIGHTY God, who through thine only-begotten Son Jesus Christ
      hast overcome death, and opened unto us the gate of everlasting
      life; We humbly beseech thee that, as by thy special grace preventing
      us thou dost put into our minds good desires, so by thy continual
      help we may bring the same to good effect; through the same Jesus
      Christ our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy
      Ghost ever, one God, world without end. Amen.</P>

      <P>THE EPISTLE. Colossians 3.1<BR />
      BRETHREN: IF ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things
      which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.
      Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.
      For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When
      Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear
      with him in glory.</P>

      <P>GRADUAL.&nbsp; Ps. 118 .<BR />
      This is the day which the Lord hath made: We will rejoice and
      be glad in it.&nbsp; O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious:
      And his mercy endureth for ever.<BR />
      &nbsp;Alleluia, alleluia. V. (I Cor 5) Christ our Passover is
      sacrificed for us.</P>

      <P>SEQUENCE.Victimae Paschali</P>

      <P>Christians to the Paschal Victim offer your thankful praises.<BR />
      The Lamb the sheep redeemeth:<BR />
      Christ by sin undefiled, reconcileth sinners to the Father.<BR />
      Death and life are joined together in that conflict stupendous:<BR />
      The King of life who died deathless reigneth.<BR />
      Declare to us, Mary, the vision of thy journey:<BR />
      &igrave;I saw the tomb of Christ living: and likewise the glory
      of the Risen:<BR />
      Bright Angels attesting, the shroud and napkin resting.<BR />
      Yea, Christ my hope is arisen: to Galilee he now goes before
      you.&icirc;<BR />
      Christ indeed from death is risen, so we know most surely:<BR />
      O King and Conqueror, grant to us mercy.<BR />
      Amen, Alleluia.</P>

      <P><I>&para; The sequence is said until Low Sunday exclusive.</I></P>

      <P>THE GOSPEL. St. John 20.1<BR />
      AT that time: On the first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene
      early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the
      stone taken away from the sepulchre. Then she runneth, and cometh
      to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved,
      and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the
      sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him. Peter therefore
      went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre.
      So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun
      Peter, and came first to the sepulchre. And he stooping down,
      and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not
      in. Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the
      sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie, and the napkin, that
      was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped
      together in a place by itself. Then went in also that other disciple,
      which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.
      For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again
      from the dead. Then the disciples went away again unto their
      own home.</P>

      <P>&nbsp;</P>

      <P>OFFERTORY. Ps. 76&nbsp; The earth trembled and was still,
      when God arose to judgement, alleluia.</P>

      <P>SECRET .<BR />
      We beseech thee, O Lord, mercifully to accept the prayers and
      oblations of thy people: that this beginning of thy Paschal Mysteries
      may by the operation of thy grace be unto us a wholesome medicine
      unto everlasting life.&nbsp; Through.</P>

      <P>PREFACE and CANON of Easter</P>

      and truth, alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.</P>

      <P>POSTCOMMUNION .<BR />
      We beseech thee, O Lord, pour into our hearts the love of thy
      Holy Spirit: that as thou hast now fulfilled us with this Paschal
      Sacrament, so thou wouldest make us to continue in all godly
      concord.&nbsp; Through ... in the unity of the same.</P>

      <P><B>ANOTHER COLLECT, EPISTLE, AND GOSPEL</B></P>

      <P><I>&para; If in any Church the Holy Communion be twice celebrsted
      on Easter Day, the following Colelct, Epistle, and Gospel may
      be used at the first Communion.</I></P>

      <P>COLLECT<BR />
      O God, who for our redemption didst give thine only-begotten
      Son to the death of the Cross, and by his glorious Resurrection
      hast delivered us from the power of our enemy: grant us so to
      die daily from sin, that we may evermore live with him in the
      joy of his Resurrection.&nbsp; Through the same thy Son Christ
      our Lord.&nbsp; [Who.]</P>

      <P>EPISTLE<BR />
      I Corinthians 5.6<BR />
      Brethren: Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole
      lump?&nbsp; Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be
      a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover
      is sacrificed for us:&nbsp; Therefore let us keep the feast,
      not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness;
      but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</P>

      <P>GOSPEL . St. Mark 16.1<BR />
      At that time: When the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and
      Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices,
      that they might come and anoint him.&nbsp; And very early in
      the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre
      at the rising of the sun.&nbsp; And they said among themselves,
      Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?&nbsp;
      And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away:
      for it was very great.&nbsp; And entering into the sepulchre,
      they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a
      long white garment; and they were affrighted.&nbsp; And he saith
      unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which
      was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place
      where they laid him.&nbsp; But go your way, tell his disciples
      and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall
      ye see him, as he said unto you.&nbsp; And they went out quickly,
      and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed:
      neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid.</P>

      <P><I>&para; Within the Octave of Easter, Mass is not said of
      any double or semidouble Feast, but Doubles which can be transferred
      are celebrated after the Octave.&nbsp; But of Doubles which cannot
      be transferred, or Semidoubles and Simples occurring after this
      triduum, a Commemoration only is made.</I>
