      <P>O GOD, who on the mount didst reveal to chosen witnesses thine
      only-begotten Son wonderfully transfigured, in raiment white
      and glistering; Mercifully grant that we, being delivered from
      the disquietude of this world, may be permitted to behold the
      King in his beauty, who with thee, O Father, and thee, O Holy
      Ghost, liveth and reigneth, one God, world without end. Amen.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>The Epistle. 2 St. Peter i. 13.</CENTER></P>

      <P>I THINK it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir
      you up by putting you in remembrance; knowing that shortly I
      must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ
      hath shewed me. Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able
      after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.
      For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made
      known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,
      but were eyewitnesses of his majesty. For he received from God
      the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to
      him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom
      I am well pleased. And this voice which came from heaven we heard,
      when we were with him in the holy mount.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>The Gospel. St. Luke ix. 28.</CENTER></P>

      <P>AND it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings,
      he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain
      to pray. And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was
      altered, and his raiment was white and glistering. And, behold,
      there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias: who
      appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish
      at Jerusalem. But Peter and they that were with him were heavy
      with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and
      the two men that stood with him. And it came to pass, as they
      departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good
      for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for
      thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what
      he said. While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed
      them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud. And there
      came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son:
      hear him. And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone.
      And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of
      those things which they had seen.</P>
