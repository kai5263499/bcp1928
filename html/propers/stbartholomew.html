      <P>O ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, who didst give to thine Apostle
      Bartholomew grace truly to believe and to preach thy Word; Grant,
      we beseech thee, unto thy Church, to love that Word which he
      believed, and both to preach and receive the same; through Jesus
      Christ our Lord. Amen.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>For the Epistle. Acts v. 12.</CENTER></P>

      <P>BY the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought
      among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's
      porch. And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but
      the people magnified them. And believers were the more added
      to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.) Insomuch that
      they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on
      beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing
      by might overshadow some of them. There came also a multitude
      out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks,
      and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were
      healed every one.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>The Gospel. St. Luke xxii. 24.</CENTER></P>

      <P>AND there was also a strife among them, which of them should
      be accounted the greatest. And he said unto them, The kings of
      the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise
      authority upon them are called benefactors. But ye shall not
      be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger;
      and he that is chief, as he that doth serve. For whether is greater,
      he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth
      at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth. Ye are they which
      have continued with me in my temptations. And I appoint unto
      you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me; that ye may
      eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging
      the twelve tribes of Israel.</P>
