      <P>ALMIGHTY God, who didst give such grace unto thy holy Apostle
      Saint Andrew, that he readily obeyed the calling of thy Son Jesus
      Christ, and followed him without delay; Grant unto us all, that
      we, being called by thy holy Word, may forthwith give up ourselves
      obediently to fulfil thy holy commandments; through the same
      Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>The Epistle. Romans x. 9.</CENTER></P>

      <P>IF thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt
      believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead,
      thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness;
      and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the
      scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
      For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for
      the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For
      whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
      How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?
      and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?
      and how shall they hear without a preacher? and how shall they
      preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful
      are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring
      glad tidings of good things ! But they have not all obeyed the
      gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?
      So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
      But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went
      into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.
      But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke
      you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish
      nation I will anger you. But Esaias is very bold, and saith,
      I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto
      them that asked not after me. But to Israel he saith, All day
      long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying
      people.<BR />

      <P><CENTER>The Gospel. St. Matthew iv. 18.</CENTER></P>

      <P>JESUS, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon
      called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the
      sea: for they were fishers. And he saith unto them, Follow me,
      and I will make you fishers of men. And they straightway left
      their nets, and followed him. And going on from thence, he saw
      other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother,
      in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and
      he called them. And they immediately left the ship and their
      father. and followed him.</P>
