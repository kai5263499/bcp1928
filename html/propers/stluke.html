      <P>ALMIGHTY God, who didst inspire thy servant Saint Luke the
      Physician, to set forth in the Gospel the love and healing power
      of thy Son; Manifest in thy Church the like power and love, to
      the healing of our bodies and our souls; through the same thy
      Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>The Epistle. 2 Timothy iv. 5.</CENTER></P>

      <P>WATCH thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work
      of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry. For I am now
      ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.
      I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have
      kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of
      righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give
      me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that
      love his appearing. Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:
      for Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world,
      and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus
      unto Dalmatia. Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him
      with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry. And Tychicus
      have I sent to Ephesus. The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus,
      when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, but especially
      the parchments. Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the
      Lord reward him according to his works: of whom be thou ware
      also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>The Gospel. St. Luke x. 1.</CENTER></P>

      <P>THE Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and
      two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself
      would come. Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is
      great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord
      of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.
      Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.
      Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man
      by the way. And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace
      be to this house. And if the son of peace be there, your peace
      shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again. And in
      the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they
      give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire.</P>
