    <p>O LORD, we beseech thee mercifully to receive the prayers
      of thy people who call upon thee; and grant that they may both
      perceive and know what things they ought to do, and also may
      have grace and power faithfully to fulfil the same; through Jesus
      Christ our Lord. Amen.<br />

        The Epistle. Romans xii. 1.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>I BESEECH you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God,
      that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable
      unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed
      to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your
      mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and
      perfect, will of God. For I say, through the grace given unto
      me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more
      highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according
      as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. For as we
      have many members in one body, and all members have not the same
      office: so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every
      one members one of another.<br />

    <p>NOW his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast
      of the passover. And when he was twelve years old, they went
      up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast. And when they
      had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried
      behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it.
      But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's
      journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance.
      And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem,
      seeking him. And it came to pass, that after three days they
      found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors,
      both hearing them, and asking them questions. And all that heard
      him were astonished at his understanding and answers. And when
      they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him,
      Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and
      I have sought thee sorrowing. And he said unto them, How is it
      that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's
      business? And they understood not the saying which he spake unto
      them. And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was
      subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her
      heart. And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour
      with God and man.</p>
