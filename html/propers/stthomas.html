      <P>ALMIGHTY and everliving God, who, for the greater confirmation
      of the faith, didst suffer thy holy Apostle Thomas to be doubtful
      in thy Son's resurrection; Grant us so perfectly, and without
      all doubt, to believe in thy Son Jesus Christ, that our faith
      in thy sight may never be reproved. Hear us, O Lord, through
      the same Jesus Christ, to whom, with thee and the Holy Ghost,
      be all honour and glory, now and for evermore. Amen.<BR />
      </P>

      <P>CAST not away therefore your confidence, which hath great
      recompence of reward. For ye have need of patience, that, after
      ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise. For
      yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will
      not tarry. Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw
      back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. But we are not of
      them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to
      the saving of the soul. Now faith is the substance of things
      hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.<BR />

      <P><CENTER>The Gospel. St. John xx. 24.</CENTER></P>

      <P>THOMAS, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them
      when Jesus came. The other disciples therefore said unto him,
      We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall
      see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into
      the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will
      not believe. And after eight days again his disciples were within,
      and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut,
      and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you. Then saith
      he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and
      reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not
      faithless, but believing. And Thomas answered and said unto him,
      My Lord and my God. Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou
      hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have
      not seen, and yet have believed. And many other signs truly did
      Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written
      in this book: but these are written, that ye might believe that
      Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might
      have life through his name.</P>
