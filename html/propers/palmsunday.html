          mankind, hast sent thy Son, our Saviour Jesus Christ, to take
          upon him our flesh, and to suffer death upon the cross, that
          all mankind should follow the example of his great humility;
          Mercifully grant, that we may both follow the example of his
          patience, and also be made partakers of his resurrection; through
          the same Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

          being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal
          with God: but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him
          the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: and
          being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became
          obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God
          also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above
          every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,
          of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the
          earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ
          is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.<br />

        <p align="left">WHEN the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders
          of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:
          and when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered
          him to Pontius Pilate the governor. Then Judas, which had betrayed
          him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and
          brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests
          and elders, saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the
          innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to
          that. And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and
          departed, and went and hanged himself. And the chief priests
          took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put
          them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood. And
          they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to
          bury strangers in. Wherefore that field was called, The field
          of blood, unto this day. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken
          by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces
          of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the
          children of Israel did value; and gave them for the potter's
          field, as the Lord appointed me. And Jesus stood before the governor:
          and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the
          Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest. And when he was accused
          of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing. Then said
          Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness
          against thee? And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that
          the governor marvelled greatly. Now at that feast the governor
          was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.
          And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas. Therefore
          when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom
          will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is
          called Christ? For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.
          When he was set down on the judgment-seat, his wife sent unto
          him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for
          I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.
          But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that
          they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. The governor answered
          and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release
          unto you? They said, Barabbas. Pilate saith unto them, What shall
          I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto
          him, Let him be crucified. And the governor said, Why, what evil
          hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be
          crucified. When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but
          that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his
          hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood
          of this just person: see ye to it. Then answered all the people,
          and said, His blood be on us, and on our children. Then released
          he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered
          him to be crucified. Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus
          into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of
          soldiers. And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.
          And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon
          his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee
          before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews! And
          they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.
          And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from
          him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify
          him. And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon
          by name: him they compelled to bear his cross. And when they
          were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place
          of a skull, they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink. And they
          crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it
          might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted
          my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.
          And sitting down they watched him there; and set up over his
          head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
          Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right
          hand, and another on the left. And they that passed by reviled
          him, wagging their heads, and saying, Thou that destroyest the
          temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou
          be the Son of God, come down from the cross. Likewise also the
          chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,
          He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of
          Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe
          him. He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have
          him: for he said, I am the Son of God. The thieves also, which
          were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth. Now from
          the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the
          ninth hour. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud
          voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My
          God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Some of them that stood
          there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.
          And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled
          it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.
          The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to
          save him. Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded
          up the ghost. And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in
          twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and
          the rocks rent; and the graves were opened; and many bodies of
          the saints which slept arose, and came out of the graves after
          his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto
          many. Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching
          Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they
          feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.</p>
