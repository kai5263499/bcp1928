      by adoption and grace, may daily be renewed by thy Holy Spirit;

        The Epistle. Hebrews i. 1.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>GOD, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time
      past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days
      spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all
      things, by whom also he made the worlds; who being the brightness
      of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding
      all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged
      our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;
      being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance
      obtained a more excellent name than they. For unto which of the
      angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I
      begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall
      be to me a Son? And again, when he bringeth in the first-begotten
      into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship
      him. And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits,
      and his ministers a flame of fire. But unto the Son he saith,
      Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness
      is the sceptre of thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness,
      and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed
      thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. And, Thou, Lord,
      in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the
      heavens are the works of thine hands: they shall perish; but
      thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;
      and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed:
      but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.<br />

    <p>IN the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
      and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God.
      All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing
      made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light
      of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended
      it not. There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. The
      same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all
      men through him might believe. He was not that Light, but was
      sent to bear witness of that Light. That was the true Light,
      which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. He was in
      the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew
      him not. He came unto his own, and his own received him not.
      But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become
      the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: which
      were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of
      the will or man, but of God. And the Word was made flesh, and
      dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the
      only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.</p>

    <p>THE grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to
      all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts,
      we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present
      world; looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing
      of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; who gave himself
      for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify
      unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. These
      things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let
      no man despise thee.<br />

    </p>
    <p>AND it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree
      from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed. (And
      this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)
      And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city. And Joseph
      also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into
      Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because
      he was of the house and lineage of David :) to be taxed with
      Mary his espoused wife, being great with child. And so it was,
      that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that
      she should be delivered. And she brought forth her firstborn
      son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a
      manger; because there was no room for them in the inn. And there
      were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping
      watch over their flock by night. And, lo, the angel of the Lord
      came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them:
      and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, Fear
      not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which
      shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the
      city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall
      be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling
      clothes, lying in a manger. And suddenly there was with the angel
      a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory
      to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.</p>
