      <P>O EVERLASTING God, who hast ordained and constituted the services
      of Angels and men in a wonderful order; Mercifully grant that,
      as thy holy Angels always do thee service in heaven, so, by thy
      appointment, they may succour and defend us on earth; through
      Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>For the Epistle. Revelation xii. 7.</CENTER></P>

      <P>THERE was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against
      the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed
      not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. And the
      great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil,
      and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into
      the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. And I heard
      a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength,
      and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for
      the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them
      before our God day and night. And they overcame him by the blood
      of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved
      not their lives unto the death. Therefore rejoice, ye heavens,
      and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth
      and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great
      wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>The Gospel. St. Matthew xviii. 1.</CENTER></P>

      <P>AT the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who
      is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? And Jesus called a
      little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, and
      said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become
      as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.
      Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child,
      the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And whoso shall
      receive one such little child in my name receiveth me. But whoso
      shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it
      were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck,
      and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. Woe unto the
      world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences
      come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh! Wherefore
      if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them
      from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed,
      rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting
      fire. And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it
      from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one
      eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell-fire. Take
      heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say
      unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face
      of my Father which is in heaven.</P>
