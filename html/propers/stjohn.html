    <p>MERCIFUL Lord, we beseech thee to cast thy bright beams of
      light upon thy Church, that it, being illumined by the doctrine
      of thy blessed Apostle and Evangelist Saint John, may so walk
      in the light of thy truth, that it may at length attain to life
      everlasting; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<br />

        The Epistle. 1 St. John i. 1.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>THAT which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which
      we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our
      hands have handled, of the Word of life; (for the life was manifested,
      and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that
      eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto
      us;) that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that
      ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship
      is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. And these
      things write we unto you, that your joy may be full. This then
      is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you,
      that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. If we say
      that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie,
      and do not the truth: but if we walk in the light, as he is in
      the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood
      of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. If we say
      that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not
      in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive
      us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we
      say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word
      is not in us.<br />

        The Gospel. St. John xxi. 19.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>JESUS saith unto Peter, Follow me. Then Peter, turning about,
      seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned
      on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth
      thee? Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this
      man do? Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I
      come, what is that to thee? Follow thou me. Then went this saying
      abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die:
      yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will
      that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? This is the
      disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things:
      and we know that his testimony is true. And there are also many
      other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written
      every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain
      the books that should be written.</p>
