      <P><BR />
      O PRAISE the LORD, for it is a good thing to sing praises unto
      our God; * yea, a joyful and pleasant thing it is to be thankful.<BR />
      The LORD doth build up Jerusalem, * and gather together the outcasts
      of Israel.<BR />
      He healeth those that are broken in heart, * and giveth medicine
      to heal their sickness.<BR />
      O sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; * sing praises upon the
      harp unto our God:<BR />
      Who covereth the heaven with clouds, and prepareth rain for the
      earth; * and maketh the grass to grow upon the mountains, and
      herb for the use of men;<BR />
      Who giveth fodder unto the cattle, * and feedeth the young ravens
      that call upon him.<BR />
      Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; * praise thy God, O Sion.<BR />
      For he hath made fast the bars of thy gates, * and hath blessed
      thy children within thee.<BR />
      He maketh peace in thy borders, * and filleth thee with the flour
      of wheat.<BR />
      Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost;<BR />
      As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, * world
      without end. Amen.<BR />
      </P>

      <P>O MOST merciful Father, who hast blessed the labours of the
      husbandman in the returns of the fruits of the earth; We give
      thee humble and hearty thanks for this thy bounty; beseeching
      thee to continue thy loving-kindness to us, that our land may
      still yield her increase, to thy glory and our comfort; through
      Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>The Epistle. St. James i. 16.</CENTER></P>

      <P>DO not err, my beloved brethren. Every good gift and every
      perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of
      lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.
      Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should
      be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. Wherefore, my beloved
      brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow
      to wrath: for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness
      of God. Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of
      naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which
      is able to save your souls. But be ye doers of the word, and
      not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. For if any be a
      hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding
      his natural face in a glass: for he beholdeth himself, and goeth
      his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.
      But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth
      therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work,
      this man shall be blessed in his deed. If any man among you seem
      to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his
      own heart, this man's religion is vain. Pure religion and undefiled
      before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and
      widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from
      the world.<BR />

      <P><CENTER>The Gospel. St. Matthew vi. 25.</CENTER></P>

      <P>JESUS said, Be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat,
      or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall
      put on. Is not the life more than food, and the body than raiment?
      Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they
      reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth
      them. Are ye not much better than they? Which of you by being
      anxious can add one cubit unto the measure of his life? And why
      are ye anxious for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field,
      how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: and yet I
      say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed
      like one of these. Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the
      field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven,
      shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith? Therefore
      be not anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we
      drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? (For after all these
      things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth
      that ye have need of all these things. But seek ye first the
      kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall
      be added unto you. Be not therefore anxious for the morrow: for
      the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient
      unto the day is the evil thereof.</P>
