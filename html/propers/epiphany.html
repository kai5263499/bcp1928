    <p>O GOD, who by the leading of a star didst manifest thy only-begotten
      Son to the Gentiles; Mercifully grant that we, who know thee
      now by faith, may after this life have the fruition of thy glorious
      Godhead; through the same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

        The Epistle. Ephesians iii. 1.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>FOR this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you
      Gentiles, if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of
      God, which is given me to you-ward: how that by revelation he
      made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,
      whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the
      mystery of Christ) which in other ages was not made known unto
      the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles
      and prophets by the Spirit; that the Gentiles should be fellow-heirs,
      and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ
      by the gospel: whereof I was made a minister, according to the
      gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working
      of his power. Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints,
      is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles
      the unsearchable riches of Christ; and to make all men see what
      is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of
      the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus
      Christ: to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers
      in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold
      wisdom of God, according to the eternal purpose which he purposed
      in Christ Jesus our Lord: in whom we have boldness and access
      with confidence by the faith of him.<br />

        The Gospel. St. Matthew ii. 1.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>WHEN Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea, in the days of
      Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to
      Jerusalem, saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews?
      for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship
      him. When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled,
      and all Jerusalem with him. And when he had gathered all the
      chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded
      of them where Christ should be born. And they said unto him,
      In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,
      And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among
      the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that
      shall rule my people Israel. Then Herod, when he had privily
      called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the
      star appeared. And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and
      search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found
      him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.
      When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star,
      which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and
      stood over where the young child was. When they saw the star,
      they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. And when they were come
      into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother,
      and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their
      treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense,
      and myrrh. And being warned of God in a dream that they should
      not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another
      way.</p>
