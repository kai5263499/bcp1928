    <p><b>INTROIT <i>Dominus fortitudo. Psalm 28.</i></b><br />
      THE Lord is the strength of
      his people, and he is the wholesome defence of his Anointed:
      O Lord, save thy people, and give thy blessing unto thine inheritance:
      feed them, and set them up for ever. <i>Ps ibid. </i>Unto thee
      will I cry, O Lord, my God, think no scorn of me: lest, if thou
      make as though thou hearest not, I become like unto them that
      go down into the pit. V. Glory be.</p>
    <p><b>COLLECT.</b><br />
      O GOD, who hast prepared for those who love thee such good things
      as pass man's understanding; Pour into our hearts such love toward
      thee, that we, loving thee above all things, may obtain thy promises,
      which exceed all that we can desire; through Jesus Christ our
      Lord. AMEN.</p>
    <p><b>EPISTLE. <i>Romans</i> 6:3-11</b><br />
      3 Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus
      Christ were baptized into his death?<br />
      4 Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that
      like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the
      Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.<br />
      5 For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his
      death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:<br />
      6 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that
      the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should
      not serve sin.<br />
      7 For he that is dead is freed from sin.<br />
      8 Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also
      live with him:<br />
      9 Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more;
      death hath no more dominion over him.<br />
      10 For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he
      liveth, he liveth unto God.<br />
      11 Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto
      sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
    <p><b>GRADUAL. <i>Ps. </i>90<i> </i></b>Turn thee again, O Lord,
      at the last: and be gracious unto thy servants. V. Lord, thou
      hast been our refuge: from one generation to another.<br />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <i>Ps </i>31<i> </i>In thee, O Lord, have
      I put my trust, let me never be put to confusion: deliver me
      in thy righteousness: bow down thine ear to me, make haste to
      deliver me. Alleluia.</p>
    <p><b>GOSPEL.<i> St. Matthew </i>5:20-26</b><br />
      20 Jesus said unto his disciples:
      except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the
      scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom
      of heaven.<br />
      21 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt
      not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the
      judgment:<br />
      22 But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother
      without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever
      shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council:
      but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell
      fire.<br />
      23 Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest
      that thy brother hath ought against thee;<br />
      24 Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first
      be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.<br />
      25 Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the
      way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to
      the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou
      be cast into prison.<br />
      26 Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence,
      till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.</p>
    <p><b>OFFERTORY. <i>Ps. 17. </i></b>To hold thou up my goings
      in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not: incline thine ear to
      me, and hearken unto my words: shew thy marvellous loving-kindness,
      O Lord, thou that art the Saviour of them which put their trust
      in thee.</p>
    <p><b>SECRET.<br />
      </b>WE beseech thee, O Lord, to have compassion on our prayers:
      and graciously to accept the oblations of thy servants and handmaidens;
      that those things which each hath offered to the honour of thy
      Name may be profitable unto all for their salvation. [Through.]</p>
    <p><b>COMMUNION. <i>Ps. 27.</i></b><i> </i>I will offer in his
      dwelling an oblation with great gladness: I will sing, and speak
      praises unto the Lord.</p>
    <p><b>POSTCOMMUNION</b><br />
      O LORD, who hast satisfied us withy thy heavenly bounties: grant
      that we may be cleansed from all our secret faults, and delivered
      from all the crafts and assaults of our enemies. [Through.]<br />
