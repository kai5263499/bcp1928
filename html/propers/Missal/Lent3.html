      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>MINE eyes are ever looking
      unto the Lord, for he shall pluck my feet out of the net: turn
      thee unto me, and have mercy upon me: for I am desolate and in
      misery. <I>Psalm ibid</I>, O Lord, will I lift up my soul: my
      God, in thee have I put my trust, let me not be confounded. V.
      Glory be. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      WE beseech thee, Almighty God, look upon the hearty desires of
      thy humble servants, and stretch forth the right hand of thy
      Majesty, to be our defence against all our enemies. [Through.]
<BR />
<BR />
      <B>EPISTLE. <I>Ephesians </I>5:1-14<BR />
      </B>1 BRETHREN: Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;
<BR />
      2 And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given
      himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling
      savour. <BR />
      3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let
      it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; <BR />
      4 Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which
      are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks. <BR />
      5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person,
      nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in
      the kingdom of Christ and of God. <BR />
      6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these
      things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.
<BR />
      7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them. <BR />
      8 For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the
      Lord: walk as children of light: <BR />
      9 (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness
      and truth;) <BR />
      10 Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. <BR />
      11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness,
      but rather reprove them. <BR />
      12 For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are
      done of them in secret. <BR />
      13 But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the
      light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light. <BR />
      14 Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from
      the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps. 9.</I> </B>Up, Lord, and let not man have
      the upper hand: let the heathen be judged in thy sight. V. While
      mine enemies are driven back, they shall fall and perish at thy
      presence. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>TRACT.</B> <B><I>Ps. </I>123. </B>Unto thee lift I up mine
      eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens. V. Behold, even as
      the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters. V.
      And as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress: even
      so our eyes wait upon the Lord our God, until he have mercy upon
      us. V. Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>Saint Luke </I>11:14-28<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>14 AT that time: Jesus
      was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass,
      when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered.
<BR />
      15 But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub
      the chief of the devils. <BR />
      16 And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.
<BR />
      17 But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom
      divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house
      divided against a house falleth. <BR />
      18 If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom
      stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.
<BR />
      19 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons
      cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges. <BR />
      20 But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt
      the kingdom of God is come upon you. <BR />
      21 When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are
      in peace: <BR />
      22 But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome
      him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and
      divideth his spoils. <BR />
      23 He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth
      not with me scattereth. <BR />
      24 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through
      dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will
      return unto my house whence I came out. <BR />
      25 And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished. <BR />
      26 Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more
      wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and
      the last state of that man is worse than the first. <BR />
      27 And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman
      of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed
      is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.
<BR />
      28 But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word
      of God, and keep it. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps. </I>19<I>.</I></B><I> </I>The statues of
      the Lord are right, and rejoice the heart, sweeter also than
      honey and the honeycomb: moreover thy servant keepeth them. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>SECRET.<BR />
      </B>GRANT, O Lord, we pray thee, that this oblation may in such
      wise cleanse us from all our sins: that we thy servants, being
      sanctified both in body and soul, may worthily offer unto thee
      this our sacrifice. [Through.]<BR />
<BR />
      <B>COMMUNION. <I>Ps. </I>84<I>.</I></B> The sparrow hath found
      her an house, and the swallow a nest, where she may lay her young:
      even thy altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God: blessed
      are they that dwell in thy house: they will be alway praising
      thee. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      O LORD, who sufferest us to be partakers of thy wondrous mysteries:
      grant, we beseech thee; that by thy mercy we may be absolved
      from all our iniquities, and defended against all adversities.
      [Through.]<BR />
