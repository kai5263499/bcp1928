      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>All the world shall worship
      thee, O God: sing of thee, and praise thy Name, O thou Most Highest.
      O be joyful in God, all ye lands, sing praises unto the honour
      of his Name: make his praise to be glorious V. Glory be. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, who dost govern all things in heaven
      and earth: mercifully hear the supplications of thy people, and
      grant us thy peace all the days of our life. [Through] <BR />
<BR />
      <B>EPISTLE. <I>Romans 12:6-16a<BR />
      </I></B>6 BRETHREN: Having then gifts differing according to
      the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy
      according to the proportion of faith; <BR />
      7 Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth,
      on teaching; <BR />
      8 Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him
      do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that
      showeth mercy, with cheerfulness. <BR />
      9 Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil;
      cleave to that which is good. <BR />
      10 Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love;
      in honour preferring one another; <BR />
      11 Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;
<BR />
      12 Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant
      in prayer; <BR />
      13 Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.
<BR />
      14 Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not. <BR />
      15 Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that
      weep. <BR />
      16 Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things,
      but condescend to men of low estate.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps. </I>107</B><I> </I>The Lord sent his Word
      and healed them: and they were saved from their destruction.
      V. O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness:
      and declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men.<BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V.<I> Ps. </I>148<I> </I>Praise the Lord,
      all ye Angels of his: praise him all his host. Alleluia.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>Saint Mark 1:1-11<BR />
      </I><IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B> 1 The beginning of the
      gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God; <BR />
      2 As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger
      before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. <BR />
      3 The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way
      of the Lord, make his paths straight. <BR />
      4 John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism
      of repentance for the remission of sins. <BR />
      5 And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they
      of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan,
      confessing their sins. <BR />
      6 And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of
      a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;
<BR />
      7 And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after
      me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down
      and unloose. <BR />
      8 I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize
      you with the Holy Ghost. <BR />
      9 And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth
      of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan. <BR />
      10 And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens
      opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him: <BR />
      11 And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved
      Son, in whom I am well pleased. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps.</I> 66.<I> </I></B>O be joyful in God, all
      ye lands: sing praises unto the honour of his Name: O come hither
      and hearken, all ye that fear God: and I will tell you what the
      Lord hath done for my soul. Alleluia.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>SECRET.<BR />
      </B>WE beseech thee, O Lord, that thou wouldest vouchsafe to
      sanctify these our oblations: and to cleanse us from the defilement
      of all our iniquities. [Through.]<BR />
<BR />
      <B>COMMUNION. <I>St. Mark </I>1.</B><I> </I>And there came a
      voice from heaven, saying: Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I
      am well pleased. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      INCREASE, O Lord, we pray thee, and multiply upon us the operation
      of thine almighty power: that we, whom thou hast quickened with
      these heavenly sacraments, may by thy grace be made ready to
      receive the benefits which thou dost promise. [Through.] <BR />
