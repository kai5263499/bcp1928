      INTROIT. <I>Rorate coeli. Isa. </I>45<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B> DROP down, ye heavens,
      from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness: let the
      earth open and bring forth a Saviour. <I>Ps. </I>19. The heavens
      declare the glory of God: and the firmament sheweth his handy-work.
      V. Glory be. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      ALMIGHTY God, give us grace that we may cast away the works of
      darkness, and put upon us the armour of light, now in the time
      of this mortal life, in which thy Son, Jesus Christ, came to
      visit us in great humility: that in the last day, when he shall
      come again in his glorious majesty to judge both the quick and
      the dead; we may rise to the life immortal. Through the same
      Jesus Christ thy Son, our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with
      thee in the unity of the Holy Ghost, ever one God, world without
      end. AMEN.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      O LORD , raise up, we pray thee, thy power, and come among us,
      and with great might succour us; that whereas, through our sins
      and wickedness, we are sore let and hindered in running the race
      that is set before us, thy bountiful grace and mercy may speedily
      help and deliver us; through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom,
      with thee and the Holy Ghost, be honour and glory, world without
      end. AMEN.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>EPISTLE. <I>Philippians</I> 4:4-7</B><BR />
      4 Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice. <BR />
      5 Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.
<BR />
      6 Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication
      with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. <BR />
      7 And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall
      keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps.</I> 145<I>.</I> </B>The LORD is nigh unto
      all them that call upon him: yea,. all such as call upon him
      faithfully. V. My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord: and
      let all flesh give thanks unto his holy Name. <BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V.<I> </I>Come, O Lord, and tarry not: forgive
      the misdeeds of thy people. Alleluia<BR />
<BR />
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>St. John </I>1:19-28<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B> 19 And this is the record
      of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem
      to ask him, Who art thou? <BR />
      20 And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not
      the Christ. <BR />
      21 And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith,
      I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No. <BR />
      22 Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an
      answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself? <BR />
      23 He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make
      straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias. <BR />
      24 And they which were sent were of the Pharisees. <BR />
      25 And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou
      then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?
<BR />
      26 John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there
      standeth one among you, whom ye know not; <BR />
      27 He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose
      shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose. <BR />
      28 These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John
      was baptizing.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>OFFERTORY. <I>St Luke </I>1.<I> </I></B>Hail Mary, full of
      grace: the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women, and
      blessed is the fruit of thy womb.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>SECRET.</B><BR />
      WE beseech thee, O Lord, mercifully to have respect unto these
      our oblations: that the same may be profitable unto us for our
      increase in all godliness, and for the attainment of everlasting
      salvation. Through. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>COMMUNION. <I>Isa. </I>7. </B>Behold, a Virgin shall conceive
      and bear a Son: and his Name shall be called Emmanuel. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      O LORD, who hast here vouchsafed unto us to be partakers of thy
      bounty: grant, we beseech thee, that we may so continue to draw
      near unto the same; that growing more and more in grace, we may
      attain in the end to everlasting life. [Through] <BR />
