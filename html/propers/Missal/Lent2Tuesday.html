      <B>EPISTLE. 1 <I>Kings</I> 17:8- 16</B><BR>
      8 IN those days: The word of the LORD came unto Elijah the Tishbite,
      saying:<BR>
      9 Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and
      dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to
      sustain thee. <BR>
      10 So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the
      gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering
      of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee,
      a little water in a vessel, that I may drink. <BR>
      11 And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said,
      Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand. <BR>
      12 And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake,
      but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse:
      and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and
      dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die. <BR>
      13 And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast
      said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto
      me, and after make for thee and for thy son. <BR>
      14 For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal
      shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the
      day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth. <BR>
      15 And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and
      she, and he, and her house, did eat many days. <BR>
      16 And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of
      oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by
      Elijah. <BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>GRADUAL.&nbsp; <I>Ps</I>. 55.&nbsp;</B> O cast thy burden
      upon the Lord: and he shall nourish thee.&nbsp; V.&nbsp; When
      I cried unto the Lord he heard my voice, from the battle that
      was against me.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>GOSPEL.<I> St Matthew </I>23:1-12<BR>
      <FONT SIZE="-1"><IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></FONT></B>1 AT
      that time: Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,
<BR>
      2 Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat: <BR>
      3 All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe
      and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do
      not. <BR>
      4 For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay
      them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them
      with one of their fingers. <BR>
      5 But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make
      broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,
<BR>
      6 And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats
      in the synagogues, <BR>
      7 And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi,
      Rabbi. <BR>
      8 But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ;
      and all ye are brethren. <BR>
      9 And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your
      Father, which is in heaven. <BR>
      10 Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even
      Christ. <BR>
      11 But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant. <BR>
      12 And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he
      that shall humble himself shall be exalted. <BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>OFFERTORY&nbsp; <I>Ps</I>. 51.&nbsp;</B> Have mercy upon me,
      O God, after they great goodness : O Lord, do away mine offences.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>SECRET.</B><BR>
      &nbsp;We beseech thee, O Lord, that by these holy mysteries thou
      wouldest be pleased to accomplish in us thy work of sanctification:
      that we, being cleansed from all earthly and carnal vices, may
      attain thy gift of everlasting life.&nbsp;&nbsp; Through.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>COMMUNION.&nbsp; <I>Ps</I>. 9.&nbsp;</B> I will speak of all
      thy marvelous works: I will be glad and rejoice in thee: yes,
      my songs will I make of thy Name, O thou Most Highest.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION</B>.<BR>
      &nbsp;O Lord, who dost vouchsafe to feed us with these holy gifts
      : grant, we beseech thee ; that we may be ever rendered worthy
      of the same, by walking obediently after thy commandments.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Through.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <I>Over the&nbsp;people.&nbsp;</I> Let us pray.&nbsp; Bow down
      before the Lord.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR>
      &nbsp;We beseech thee, O Lord, to have compassion on our prayers:
      that, we may obtain of thee the remission of all our sins, and
      evermore rejoice in thy heavenly benediction.&nbsp;&nbsp; Through.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
