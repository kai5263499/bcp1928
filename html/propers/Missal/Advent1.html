      I lift up my soul: my God, I have put my trust in thee, O let

      ALMIGHTY God, give us grace that we may cast away the works of
      darkness, and put upon us the armour of light, now in the time
      of this mortal life, in which thy Son, Jesus Christ, came to
      visit us in great humility: that in the last day, when he shall
      come again in his glorious majesty to judge both the quick and
      the dead; we may rise to the life immortal. Through the same
      Jesus Christ thy Son, our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with
      thee in the unity of the Holy Ghost, ever one God, world without
      end. AMEN. <BR />
      </P>

      <P><B>EPISTLE<I>. Romans </I>13:8-14</B><BR />
      8 Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that
      loveth another hath fulfilled the law. <BR />
      9 For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill,
      Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou
      shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is
      briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love
      thy neighbour as thyself. <BR />
      10 Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the
      fulfilling of the law. <BR />
      11 And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake
      out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.
<BR />
      12 The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore
      cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour
      of light. <BR />
      13 Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness,
      not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.
<BR />
      14 But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision
      for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps. </I>25<I> </I></B>For all they that look for
      thee shall not be ashamed, O Lord. V. Make known to me thy ways,
      O Lord: and teach me thy paths<BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V.<I> Ps. 85 </I>Shew us thy mercy, O Lord:
      and grant us thy salvation. Alleluia. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>St</I>.<I> Matthew </I>21:1-13<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B> 1 And when they drew
      nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount
      of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples, <BR />
      2 Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and
      straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose
      them, and bring them unto me. <BR />
      3 And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath
      need of them; and straightway he will send them. <BR />
      4 All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken
      by the prophet, saying, <BR />
      5 Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto
      thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an
      ass. <BR />
      6 And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them, <BR />
      7 And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes,
      and they set him thereon. <BR />
      8 And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way;
      others cut down branches from the trees, and strowed them in
      the way. <BR />
      9 And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried,
      saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh
      in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest. <BR />
      10 And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved,
      saying, Who is this? <BR />
      11 And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth
      of Galilee. <BR />
      12 And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them
      that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables
      of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,
<BR />
      13 And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called
      the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps.</I> 25<I> </I></B>Unto thee, O Lord, will
      I lift up my soul: my God, I have put my trust in thee, O let
      me not be confounded: neither let mine enemies triumph over me:
      for all they that hope in thee shall not be ashamed.</P>

      <P><B>SECRET.</B><BR />
      GRANT, we beseech thee, O Lord, that the effectual power of these
      thy holy mysteries may in such wise cleanse us from all our iniquities
      that we may in all purity attain unto him who is the author of
      the same, even Jesus Christ, thy Son, our Lord, Who liveth and
      reigneth with thee.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>COMMUNION. <I>Ps. </I>85<I>.</I></B><I> </I>The Lord shall
      shew loving-kindness: and our land shall give her increase.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      GRANT to us, O Lord, we beseech thee: so to wait for thy loving
      kindness in the midst of thy Temple, that in readiness of heart
      and mind we may hail the coming feast of our redemption. [Through.]</P>
