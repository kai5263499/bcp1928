      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>When all things were in
      quiet silence and night was in the midst of her swift course,
      thine almighty Word, O Lord, leaped down from heaven out of thy
      royal throne. Ps. 93. the Lord is King, and hath put on glorious
      apparel: the Lord hath put on his apparel and girded himself
      with strength. V. Glory be.</P>

      <P>&para; Gloria in excelsis <I>is said even if this Mass be
      resumed after January 1.<BR />
<BR />
      </I><B>COLLECT OF THE SUNDAY.</B><BR />
      Almighty and everlasting God, vouchsafe, we beseech thee, to
      govern us in all our doings in the way of thy good pleasure:
      that we, faithfully serving thee in the Name of thy well-beloved
      Son, may worthily abound in all good works. [Who.]</P>

      <P><I>And to commemorate the Octave is said:</I></P>

      <P><B>COLLECT OF CHRISTMAS DAY.<BR />
      </B>ALMIGHTY God, who hast given us thy only-begotten Son to
      take our nature upon him, and as at this time to be born of a
      pure Virgin: grant that we, being regenerate, and made thy children
      by adoption and grace, may daily be renewed by thy Holy Spirit.
      [through]</P>

      <P>[<I>But if the foregoing Collect of Christmas be said for
      the Sunday Collect, then for the Commemoration of the Octave
      may be said the Prayer-book Collect for the First Mass of Christmas</I>]<B><BR />
<BR />
      EPISTLE. <I>Galatians </I>4:1-7</B><BR />
      1 Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth
      nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; <BR />
      2 But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed
      of the father. <BR />
      3 Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the
      elements of the world: <BR />
      4 But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his
      Son, made of a woman, made under the law, <BR />
      5 To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive
      the adoption of sons. <BR />
      6 And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of
      his Son into your hearts, crying, Abbe, Father. <BR />
      7 Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son,
      then an heir of God through Christ. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>GRADUAL. Ps. 45. </B>Thou art fairer than the children of
      men: full of grace are thy lips. V. My heart is inditing of a
      good matter, I speak of the things which I have made unto the
      king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.<BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. Ps. 93. The Lord is King and hath put
      on glorious apparel: the Lord hath put on his apparel and girded
      himself with strength. Alleluia.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>St. Matthew </I>1:18-25<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>18 Now the birth of Jesus
      Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused
      to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child
      of the Holy Ghost. <BR />
      19 Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing
      to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily.
<BR />
      20 But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of
      the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son
      of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that
      which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. <BR />
      21 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name
      JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins. <BR />
      22 Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was
      spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, <BR />
      23 Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth
      a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted
      is, God with us. <BR />
      24 Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the
      Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife: <BR />
      25 And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn
      son: and he called his name JESUS. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>OFFERTORY. Ps. 93.</B> God hath made the round world so sure,
      that it cannot be moved: ever since the world began hath thy
      seat, O God, been prepared: thou art from everlasting.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>SECRET.</B><BR />
      Grant, we beseech thee, Almighty God: that these gifts which
      we offer in the sight of thy divine majesty, may obtain for us
      grace to serve thee in this life with all godliness, and bring
      us in the end to everlasting life. Through.</P>

      <P><B>SECRET. <I>Of the Nativity<BR />
      </I></B>WE beseech thee, O Lord, that by this new Birth of thy
      only-begotten Son thou wouldest vouchsafe to sanctify these our
      oblations: and to cleanse us from the defilements of all our
      iniquities. Through the same.</P>

      <P><B>PREFACE </B><I>of Christmas, even if the Mass be resumed
      after the Octave; and Canon of Christmas except when the Mass
      is resumed after the Octave.<BR />
<BR />
      </I><B>COMMUNION. <I>St. Matt. </I>2. </B>Take the young child
      and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are
      dead which sought the young child's life.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION</B>.<BR />
      Grant, O Lord, that by the operation of these thy mysteries,
      we may be cleansed from all our sins, and obtain that which we
      have asked according to thy will. [Through.]</P>

      <P><B>POSTCOMMUNION. <I>Of the Nativity.<BR />
      </I></B>GRANT, we beseech thee, Almighty God: that like as thy
      Son, born this day the Saviour of the world, hath been made the
      author of our heavenly birth; so he may bestow upon us the gift
      of everlasting life. Who liveth and reigneth with thee, in the
      unity.</P>
