          THE THIRD SUNDAY AFTER TRINITY<br />
        </font></b>
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>INTROIT. <i>Respice in me. Ps. </i>25.</b><br />
      TURN thee unto me, and have
      mercy upon me, O Lord : for I am desolate, and in misery: look
      upon my adversity and misery: and forgive me all my sin, O my
      God. <i>Ps. ibid.</i> Unto thee, O Lord, will I lift up my soul:
      my God, I have put my trust in thee, O let me not be confounded.
      V. Glory be.</p>
    <p><b>COLLECT.</b><br />
      O LORD, we beseech thee mercifully to hear us; and grant that
      we, to whom thou hast given an hearty desire to pray, may, by
      thy mighty aid, be defended and comforted in all dangers and
      adversities; through Jesus Christ our Lord. AMEN.</p>
    <p><b><i>EPISTLE. </i>I St. Peter 5:5-11<br />
      </b>5 BRETHREN: all of you be subject one to another, and be
      clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth
      grace to the humble.<br />
      6 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that
      he may exalt you in due time:<br />
      7 Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.<br />
      8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as
      a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:<br />
      9 Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions
      are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.<br />
      10 But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal
      glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make
      you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.<br />
      11 To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
    <p><b>GRADUAL.</b> <i>Ps.</i> 55. O cast thy burden upon the
      Lord : and he shall nourish thee. V. When I cried unto the Lord,
      he heard my voice : from the battle that was against me.<br />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <i>Ps.</i> 7. God is a righteous judge,
      strong and patient, and God is provoked every day. Alleluia.</p>
    <p><b>GOSPEL. <i>St. Luke 15:1-10<br />
      </i></b> 1 AT that time: Then drew
      near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him.<br />
      2 And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth
      sinners, and eateth with them.<br />
      3 And he spake this parable unto them, saying,<br />
      4 What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of
      them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and
      go after that which is lost, until he find it?<br />
      5 And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.<br />
      6 And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and
      neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found
      my sheep which was lost.<br />
      7 I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance. <br />
      8 Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it? <br />
      9 And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost. <br />
      10 Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth. </p>
    <p><b>OFFERTORY.</b> Ps. 9. They that know thy Name will put
      their trust in thee: for thou, Lord, hast never failed them that
      seek thee: O Praise the Lord, which dwelleth in Sion: for he
      forgetteth not the complain of the poor.</p>
    <p><b>SECRET</b>.<br />
      SANCTIFY, O Lord, we beseech thee, the oblations which we offer
      unto thee: and mercifully grant that they may be made unto us
      the Body and Blood of thine only begotten Son. Who liveth and
      reigneth with thee.</p>
    <p><b><i>COMMUNION</i></b>. <i>St. Luke </i>15. I say unto you:
      There is joy in the presence of the Angels of God over one sinner
      that repenteth.</p>
    <p><b>POSTCOMMUNION</b>.<br />
      WE BESEECH thee, O Lord, that we which have received these holy
      mysteries: may be their power be cleansed from all our iniquities;
      and evermore be filled with the bounteous gifts of thy grace.
