          THE EIGHTH SUNDAY AFTER TRINITY<br />
        </font></b>
      </center>
    </p>
    <p><b>INTROIT. <i>Suscepimus. Psalm 48 </i></b><br />
      WE have waited for thy loving-kindness,
      O God, in the midst of thy temple: O God, according to thy Name,
      so is thy praise unto the world's end: thy right hand is full
      of righteousness. <i>Ps. ibid. </i>Great is the Lord, and highly
      to be praised: in the city of our God, even upon his holy hill.
      V. Glory be.</p>
    <p><b>COLLECT.</b><br />
      O GOD, whose never-failing providence ordereth all things both
      in heaven and earth: we humbly beseech thee to put away from
      us all hurtful things, and to give us those things which are
      profitable for us; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
    <p><b>EPISTLE. <i>Romans</i> <i>8:12-17</i></b><br />
      12 BRETHREN, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after
      the flesh.<br />
      13 For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through
      the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.<br />
      14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the
      sons of God.<br />
      15 For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;
      but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry,
      Abba, Father.<br />
      16 The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we
      are the children of God:<br />
      17 And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs
      with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be
      also glorified together.<br />
        <br />
        <b>GRADUAL. <i>Ps. 31 </i></b>Be thou my strong rock and house
      of defence, that thou mayest save me. V. In thee, O Lord, have
      I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion.<br />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <i>Ps. 48. </i>Great is the Lord, and
      highly to be praised: in the city of our God, even upon his holy
      hill. Alleluia.</p>
    <p><b>GOSPEL. <i>St. Matthew 7:15-21</i></b><br />
      15 AT that time; Jesus said
      to his disciples: Beware of false prophets, which come to you
      in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.<br />
      16 Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of
      thorns, or figs of thistles?<br />
      17 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt
      tree bringeth forth evil fruit.<br />
      18 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt
      tree bring forth good fruit.<br />
      19 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down,
      and cast into the fire.<br />
      20 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.<br />
      21 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter
      into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my
      Father which is in heaven.</p>
    <p><b>OFFERTORY. <i>Ps. 18. </i></b>Thou shalt save the people
      that are in adversity, O Lord, and shalt bring down the high
      looks of the proud: for who is God, but the Lord?</p>
    <p><b>SECRET.<br />
      </b>O GOD, who didst ratify the manifold sacrifices of the law
      by the one perfect sacrifice of our redemption: mercifully accept
      the oblation of thy bounden servants, and sanctify them with
      that benediction wherewith thou didst bless the gifts of Abel
      thy servant; that what each hath offered to the honour of thy
      majesty may be profitable unto all for their salvation. Through.</p>
    <p><b>COMMUNION. <i>Ps. 34.</i></b><i> </i>O taste and see how
      gracious the Lord is: blessed is he that putteth his trust in
      him.</p>
    <p><b>POSTCOMMUNION</b><br />
      GRANT, O Lord, that the power of thy healing may mercifully cleanse
      us from all our perversities: and lead us henceforth in the paths
      of righteousness. Through.</p>
