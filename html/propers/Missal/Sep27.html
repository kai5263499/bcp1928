      <B>INTROIT. <I>Sapientiam. Ecclus. </I>44</B><BR />
      THE people will tell of their wisdom, and the congregation will
      shew forth their praise: their name liveth for evermore. <I>Ps.
      </I>33. Rejoice in the Lord, O ye righteous: for it becometh
      well the just to be thankful. V. Glory be.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      O GOD, who vouchsafest unto us to keep the heavenly birthday
      of Blessed Cosmas and Damian, thy holy Martyrs: grant, we beseech
      thee; that we may rejoice in the perpetual felicity of their
      fellowship in heaven. Through.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>For the Epistle. <FONT COLOR="#000000">Wisdom 5:15</FONT></B><BR />
      BUT the righteous live for evermore; their reward also is with
      the Lord, and the care of them is with the Most High. Therefore
      shall they receive a glorious kingdom, and a beautiful crown
      from the Lord's hand: for with his right hand shall he cover
      them, and with his arm shall he protect them. He shall take to
      him his jealousy for a complete armour, and make the creature
      his weapon for the revenge of his enemies. He shall put on righteousness
      as a breastplate, and true judgement instead of a helmet. He
      shall take holiness for an invincible shield.</P>

      <P><B>GRADUAL. <I>PS. </I>124.</B> Our soul is escaped even as
      a bird out of the snare of the fowler. V. The snare is broken,
      and we are delivered: or help standeth in the Name of the Lord,
      who hat made heaven and earth.<BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>Ps. </I>68 Let the righteous be glad
      and rejoice before God: let them also be merry and joyful. Alleluia.<BR />
      <I>After Septuagesima, instead of the </I>Alleluia, <I>and verse
      following, is said:<BR />
      </I></P>

      <P><B>TRACT. <I>Ps. </I>126. </B>They that sow in tears, shall
      reap in joy. V. He that now goeth on his way weeping, and beareth
      forth good seed. He shall doubtless come again with joy, and
      bring his sheaves with him.</P>

      <P><B>The Gospel. St. Luke 6:17</B><BR />
      At that time: Jesus came down from the mountain and stood in
      the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude
      of people out of all Judea and Jerusalem and from the sea coast
      of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of
      their diseases; and they that were vexed with unclean spirits;
      and they were healed. and the whole multitude sought to touch
      him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all. And
      he lifted up his eyes on his disciples and said: Blessed are
      ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God. Blessed are ye that
      hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep
      now: for ye shall laugh. Blessed are ye when men shall hate you,
      and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall
      reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of
      Man's sake. Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy; for behold
      your reward is great in heaven.</P>

      <P><I>After Septuagesima, </I>Alleluia <I>at the end of the following
      Offertory is omitted, but otherwise it is said through the year.</I></P>

      <P><B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps. </I>149. </B>Let the Saints be joyful
      with glory, let them rejoice in their beds: let the praises of
      God be in their mouth, (alleluia).</P>

      <P><B>SECRET.</B><BR />
      WE beseech thee, O Lord, that the gifts which we offer unto thee
      of our bounden duty and service may be acceptable unto thee for
      the honour of thy Saints: and by thy mercy profitable unto us
      for our salvation. Through.</P>

      <P><B>COMMUNION. <I>St. Luke </I>12.</B> And I say unto you my
      friends: Be not afraid of them that kill the body.</P>

      <P><B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      GRANT, we beseech thee, Almighty God: that at the intercession
      of thy holy Martyrs Cosmas and Damian, we who with our outward
      lips have partaken of this holy Sacrament, may inwardly receive
      the same in purity of heart. Through.</P>
