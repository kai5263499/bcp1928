      thou my cause, O Lord, with them that strive with me ; and fight

      </B>Almighty God, whose most dear Son went not up to joy but
      first he suffered pain, and entered not into glory before he
      was crucified: mercifully grant that we, walking in the way of
      the Cross, may find it none other than the way of life and peace.
      Through the same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. [Who.]<BR>
<BR>
      <B>COLLECT. 2 </B>of Palm Sunday.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>For the EPISTLE. </B><I>Isaiah 63:1-19<BR>
      </I>1 Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from
      Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the
      greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty
      to save.<BR>
      2 Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like
      him that treadeth in the winevat?<BR>
      3 I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there
      was none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample
      them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments,
      and I will stain all my raiment.<BR>
      4 For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of
      my redeemed is come.<BR>
      5 And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that
      there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation
      unto me; and my fury, it upheld me.<BR>
      6 And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them
      drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the
      earth.<BR>
      7 I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, and the praises
      of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on
      us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which
      he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according
      to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.<BR>
      8 For he said, Surely they are my people, children that will
      not lie: so he was their Saviour.<BR>
      9 In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of
      his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed
      them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.<BR>
      10 But they rebelled, and vexed his holy spirit: therefore he
      was turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them.<BR>
      11 Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people,
      saying, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with
      the shepherd of his flock? where is he that put his holy spirit
      within him?<BR>
      12 That led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious
      arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting
      name?<BR>
      13 That led them through the deep, as an horse in the wilderness,
      that they should not stumble?<BR>
      14 As a beast goeth down into the valley, the spirit of the LORD
      caused him to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself
      a glorious name.<BR>
      15 Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy
      holiness and of thy glory: where is thy zeal and thy strength,
      the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are
      they restrained?<BR>
      16 Doubtless thou art our father, though Abraham be ignorant
      of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O LORD, art our father,
      our redeemer; thy name is from everlasting.<BR>
      17 O LORD, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, and hardened
      our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants' sake, the tribes
      of thine inheritance.<BR>
      18 The people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little
      while: our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.<BR>
      19 We are thine: thou never barest rule over them; they were
      not called by thy name.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>GRADUAL.</B><I> Ps. 35.</I> Awake, O Lord, and stand up to
      judge my quarrel, avenge thou my cause, my God, and my Lord.

      <B>TRACT.</B> <I>Ps. 103.</I> O Lord, deal not with us after
      our sins: nor reward us according to our wickednesses. V. Ps.
      79. Lord, remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us,
      and that soon: for we are come to great misery. (Here genuflect.)
      V. Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name,
      O Lord: O deliver us, and be merciful unto our sins, for thy
      Names's sake.<BR>
<BR>
      The <B>PASSION</B> of our Lord Jesus Christ, according to Mark.<BR>
<BR>
      St. Mark 14:1-72<BR>
      1 After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened
      bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they
      might take him by craft, and put him to death.<BR>
      2 But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar
      of the people.<BR>
      3 And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he
      sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment
      of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured
      it on his head.<BR>
      4 And there were some that had indignation within themselves,
      and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?<BR>
      5 For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence,
      and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her.<BR>
      6 And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath
      wrought a good work on me.<BR>
      7 For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will
      ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.<BR>
      8 She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint
      my body to the burying.<BR>
      9 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached
      throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall
      be spoken of for a memorial of her.<BR>
      10 And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief
      priests, to betray him unto them.<BR>
      11 And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give
      him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.<BR>
      12 And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the
      passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we
      go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?<BR>
      13 And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto
      them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing
      a pitcher of water: follow him.<BR>
      14 And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the
      house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall
      eat the passover with my disciples?<BR>
      15 And he will show you a large upper room furnished and prepared:
      there make ready for us.<BR>
      16 And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and
      found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.<BR>
      17 And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.<BR>
      18 And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto
      you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.<BR>
      19 And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by
      one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?<BR>
      20 And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve,
      that dippeth with me in the dish.<BR>
      21 The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but
      woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were
      it for that man if he had never been born.<BR>
      22 And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake
      it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.<BR>
      23 And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave
      it to them: and they all drank of it.<BR>
      24 And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament,
      which is shed for many.<BR>
      25 Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of
      the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of
      God.<BR>
      26 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount
      of Olives.<BR>
      27 And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because
      of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd,
      and the sheep shall be scattered.<BR>
      28 But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.<BR>
      29 But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet
      will not I.<BR>
      30 And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this
      day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt
      deny me thrice.<BR>
      31 But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee,
      I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.<BR>
      32 And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he
      saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.<BR>
      33 And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began
      to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;<BR>
      34 And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death:
      tarry ye here, and watch.<BR>
      35 And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and
      prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.<BR>
      36 And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee;
      take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but
      what thou wilt.<BR>
      37 And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter,
      Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?<BR>
      38 Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit
      truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.<BR>
      39 And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.<BR>
      40 And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their
      eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.<BR>
      41 And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on
      now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold,
      the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.<BR>
      42 Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.<BR>
      43 And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of
      the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves,
      from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.<BR>
      44 And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever
      I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely.<BR>
      45 And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and
      saith, Master, master; and kissed him.<BR>
      46 And they laid their hands on him, and took him.<BR>
      47 And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant
      of the high priest, and cut off his ear.<BR>
      48 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as
      against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?<BR>
      49 I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me
      not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.<BR>
      50 And they all forsook him, and fled.<BR>
      51 And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen
      cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold
      on him:<BR>
      52 And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.<BR>
      53 And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were
      assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.<BR>
      54 And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the
      high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself
      at the fire.<BR>
      55 And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness
      against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.<BR>
      56 For many bare false witness against him, but their witness
      agreed not together.<BR>
      57 And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him,
      saying,<BR>
      58 We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made
      with hands, and within three days I will build another made without
      hands.<BR>
      59 But neither so did their witness agree together.<BR>
      60 And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus,
      saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness
      against thee?<BR>
      61 But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high
      priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the
      Son of the Blessed?<BR>
      62 And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting
      on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.<BR>
      63 Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need
      we any further witnesses?<BR>
      64 Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned
      him to be guilty of death.<BR>
      65 And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and
      to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants
      did strike him with the palms of their hands.<BR>
      66 And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of
      the maids of the high priest: 67 And when she saw Peter warming
      himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with
      Jesus of Nazareth. 68 But he denied, saying, I know not, neither
      understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch;
      and the cock crew. 69 And a maid saw him again, and began to
      say to them that stood by, This is one of them. 70 And he denied
      it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to
      Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean,
      and thy speech agreeth thereto. 71 But he began to curse and
      to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak. 72 And
      the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word
      that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt
      deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.<BR>
