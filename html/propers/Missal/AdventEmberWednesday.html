      <B>The Lesson. <I>Isaiah </I>2:2-5</B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      2 And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain
      of the LORD'S house shall be established in the top of the mountains,
      and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow
      unto it. <BR />
      3 And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up
      to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob;
      and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths:
      for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD
      from Jerusalem. <BR />
      4 And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many
      people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and
      their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword
      against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. <BR />
      5 O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of
      the LORD.</FONT></P>

      10 Moreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying, <BR />
      11 Ask thee a sign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the
      depth, or in the height above. <BR />
      12 But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.
<BR />
      13 And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small
      thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also? <BR />
      14 Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold,
      a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name
      Immanuel. <BR />
      15 Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse
      the evil, and choose the good.</FONT></P>

      <P><B>GOSPEL.<I> St Luke</I> 1:26-38</B><BR />
      26 AT THAT TIME: the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city
      of Galilee, named Nazareth, <BR />
      27 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the
      house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. <BR />
      28 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that
      art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou
      among women. <BR />
      29 And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and
      cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be. <BR />
      30 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast
      found favour with God. <BR />
      31 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth
      a son, and shalt call his name JESUS. <BR />
      32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest:
      and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father
      David: <BR />
      33 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of
      his kingdom there shall be no end. <BR />
      34 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I
      know not a man? <BR />
      35 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall
      come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow
      thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee
      shall be called the Son of God. <BR />
      36 And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived
      a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who
      was called barren. <BR />
      37 For with God nothing shall be impossible. <BR />
      38 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto
      me according to thy word.</P>

      <P><B>OFFERTORY. <I>Isa. </I>35. </B>Be strong, and fear not:
      behold, your God will come with vengeance; even God with a recompence:
      he will come and save you.</P>

      <P><B>SECRET</B>. <BR />
      WE beseech thee, O Lord, that this our fast may be acceptable
      in thy sight: that we, being cleansed and made worthy of thy
      grace may obtain the promise of everlasting life which thou hast
      given us in thy Son, our Saviour Jesus Christ. Who liveth and
      reigneth with Thee.</P>

      <P><B>COMMUNION. <I>Isa. </I>7. </B>Behold, A Virgin shall conceive
      and bear a son: and his Name shall be called Emmanuel.</P>

      <P><B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      O LORD, who hast vouchsafed to bestow upon us the healing fits
      of thy bounty: grant, we beseech thee, that, like as we do rejoice
      in the partaking of the same, so they may inwardly be profitable
      to the renewing of our souls. Through.</P>
