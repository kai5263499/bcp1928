      O LORD our God, increase, we pray thee, and multiply upon us
      the gifts of thy grace: that we, who do prevent the glorious
      festival of all thy Saints, may of thee be enabled joyfully to
      follow them in all virtuous and godly living. Through.</P>

      <B>For the Epistle. <FONT COLOR="#000000">Revelation 5:6-12</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      6 IN those days: I John beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the
      throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders,
      stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven
      eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all
      the earth.<BR />
      7 And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him
      that sat upon the throne.<BR />
      8 And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and
      twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of
      them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers
      of saints.<BR />
      9 And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the
      book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and
      hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and
      tongue, and people, and nation;<BR />
      10 And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall
      reign on the earth.<BR />
      11 And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about
      the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them
      was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;<BR />
      12 Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain
      to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour,
      and glory, and blessing, for ever and ever. Amen.</FONT></P>

      <P><B>The Gospel. St Luke 6:17-23a<BR />
      </B><FONT COLOR="#000000">17 AT that time: Jesus came down with
      them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples,
      and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem,
      and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear
      him, and to be healed of their diseases;<BR />
      18 And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were
      healed.<BR />
      19 And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went
      virtue out of him, and healed them all.<BR />
      20 And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed
      be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.<BR />
      21 Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed
      are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.<BR />
      22 Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall
      separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and
      cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.<BR />
      23 Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your
      reward is great in heaven.</FONT></P>
