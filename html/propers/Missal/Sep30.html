      IN the midst of the congregation he opened his mouth: and the
      Lord filled him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding:
      he clothed him with a robe of glory (alleluia, alleluia). <I>Ps.
      </I>92. It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord: and
      to sing praises unto thy Name, O Most Highest. V. Glory be.</P>

      </B>O GOD, who for the exposition of thy holy Scriptures didst
      bestow upon thy Church the wondrous teaching of blessed Jerome
      thy Confessor and Doctor: grant, we beseech thee; that by the
      intercession of his merits, we may of thee be enabled to perform
      those things whichy he taught in word and deed. Through.</P>

      <P><BR />
      <B>The Epistle. <FONT COLOR="#000000">2 Timothy 4:1-8</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ,
      who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his
      kingdom;<BR />
      2 Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove,
      rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.<BR />
      3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine;
      but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers,
      having itching ears;<BR />
      4 And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall
      be turned unto fables.<BR />
      5 But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work
      of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.<BR />
      6 For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure
      is at hand.<BR />
      7 I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have
      kept the faith:<BR />
      8 Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,
      which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day:
      and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.<BR />
<BR />
      </FONT><B>GRADUAL. </B><I>Ps. </I>37. The Mouth of the righteous
      is exercised in wisdom: and his tongue will be talking of judgement.
      V. The law of his God is in his heart: and his goings shall not
      slide<BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>Ecclus </I>45. The Lord loved him and
      adorned him: he clothed him with a robe of glory. Alleluia.<BR />
<BR />
      <I>After Septuagesima, instead of the </I>Alleluia, <I>and verse
      following, is said:<BR />
<BR />
      </I><B>TRACT. </B><I>Ps. </I>112. Blessed is the man that feareth
      the Lord: he hath great delight in his commandments. V. His seed
      shall be mighty upon earthy: the generation of the faithful shall
      be blessed. V. Riches and plenteousness shall be in his housed:
      and his righteousness endureth for ever.<BR />
<BR />
      <I>In Eastertide, instead of the Gradual, is said:<BR />
<BR />
      </I>Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>Ecclus. </I>45. The Lord loved
      him and adorned him: he clothed him with a rob of glory. Alleluia.
      V. <I>Hosea </I>14. The righteous shall grow as the lily: and
      flourish for ever before the Lord. Alleluia.</P>

      <P><B>The Gospel. St Matthew 5:13-20</B><BR />
      13 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his
      savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good
      for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot
      of men.<BR />
      14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill
      cannot be hid.<BR />
      15 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel,
      but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in
      the house.<BR />
      16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your
      good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.<BR />
      17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets:
      I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.<BR />
      18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one
      jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all
      be fulfilled.<BR />
      19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments,
      and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom
      of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall
      be called great in the kingdom of heaven.<BR />
      20 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed
      the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no
      case enter into the kingdom of heaven.</P>

      <P><I>The Creed is said.<BR />
<BR />
      </I><B>OFFERTORY. </B><I>Ps. </I>92. The righteous shall flourish
      like a palm-tree: and shall spread abroad like a cedar in Libanus.
      (alleluia).<BR />
<BR />
      <B>SECRET.</B><BR />
      GRANT, O Lord, we pray thee that the devout prayers of the blessed
      Jerome thy Bishop and Doctor, may never fail to succour and defend
      us: that these our oblations may be rendered acceptable in thy
      sight; and that we may be made worthy to obtain for our sins
      the pardon of thy mercy. Through.<BR />

      COMMUNION. </B><I>St. Luke </I>12. A faithful and wise steward,
      whom his Lord hath made ruler over his household: to give them
      their portion of meat in due season (alleluia).<BR />
<BR />
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      GRANT, we beseech thee, O Lord, that thy holy Bishop and most
      excellent Doctor, blessed Jerome, may ever stand before thee
      as our advocate; that this sacrifice of thy ordinance may effectually
      avail for our salvation. Through.</P>
