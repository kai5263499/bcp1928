      <P><BR />
      <B>INTROIT. <I>Dicit Dominus. Jer.</I> 29<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /> </B>THUS saith the Lord:
      I know the thoughts that I think toward you, thoughts of peace,
      and not of evil; ye shall call upon me, and I will hearken unto
      you: and will turn away your captivity from all the nations.
      <I>Ps. 85 </I>Lord, thou art become gracious unto thy land: thou
      hast turned away the captivity of Jacob. V. Glory be.</P>

      <P><B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      STIR UP, we beseech thee, O Lord, the wills of thy faithful people;
      that they, plenteously bringing forth the fruit of good works,
      may by thee be plenteously rewarded; through Jesus Christ our
      Lord. AMEN.</P>

      <P><B>EPISTLE. <I>Jeremiah 23:5-8</I></B><BR />
      5 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto
      David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper,
      and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth. <BR />
      6 In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely:
      and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR
      RIGHTEOUSNESS. <BR />
      7 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that they
      shall no more say, The LORD liveth, which brought up the children
      of Israel out of the land of Egypt; <BR />
      8 But, The LORD liveth, which brought up and which led the seed
      of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all
      countries whither I had driven them; and they shall dwell in
      their own land.</P>

      <P><B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps. </I>44</B>.<I> </I>It is thou, O Lord,
      that savest us from our enemies: and puttest them to confusion
      that hate us. V. We make our boast of God all day long: and will
      praise thy Name for ever. <BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V.<I> Ps. </I>130<I> </I>Out of the deep
      have I called unto thee, O Lord: Lord, hear my voice. Alleluia.</P>

      <P><B>GOSPEL. <I>St. John </I>6:5-14<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /> </B>5 When Jesus then lifted
      up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith
      unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat? <BR />
      6 And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he
      would do. <BR />
      7 Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not
      sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.
<BR />
      8 One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith
      unto him, <BR />
      9 There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two
      small fishes: but what are they among so many? <BR />
      10 And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much
      grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five
      thousand. <BR />
      11 And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he
      distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that
      were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.
<BR />
      12 When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather
      up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost. <BR />
      13 Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets
      with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained
      over and above unto them that had eaten. <BR />
      14 Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus
      did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into
      the world.</P>

      <P><B>OFFERTORY.</B> <B><I>Ps. </I>130.</B><I> </I>Out of the
      deep have I called unto thee, O Lord: Lord, hear my voice: out
      of the deep have I called unto thee, O Lord.</P>

      <P><B>SECRET.</B><BR />
      WE beseech thee, O Lord, to have compassion on our supplications,
      and to accept the prayers and oblations of thy people: that the
      hearts of all men being turned unto thee, we may be delivered
      from the desire of all things temporal, and follow stedfastly
      after things eternal. [Through.]</P>

      <P><B>COMMUNION. <I>St. Mark </I>11.<I> </I></B>Therefore I say
      unto you, what things soever ye desire when ye pray, believe
      that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.</P>

      <P><B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      GRANT, O Lord, that the effectual healing of the sacraments which
      we have received; may deliver us from all the diseases of our
      souls. [Through. ]</P>
