      INTROIT. <I>Adorate Deum. Psalm </I>97.<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>All ye angels of God,
      fall down, and worship before him: Sion heard of it, and rejoiced,
      and the daughters of Judah were glad. <I>Psalm ibid </I>The Lord
      is King, the earth may be glad thereof: yea, the multitude of
      the isles may be glad thereof. V. Glory be. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, mercifully look upon our infirmities:
      and in all our dangers and necessities, stretch forth thy right
      hand to help and defend us. [Through.]<BR />
<BR />
      <B>EPISTLE. <I>Romans </I>12:16-21b.<BR />
      </B>16 Brethren: Be not wise in your own conceits. <BR />
      17 Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest
      in the sight of all men. <BR />
      18 If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably
      with all men. <BR />
      19 Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place
      unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay,
      saith the Lord. <BR />
      20 Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give
      him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his
      head. <BR />
      21 Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>GRADUAL. <I>Psalm </I>102.<I> </I></B>The heathen shall fear
      thy Name, O Lord: and all the kings of the earth thy majesty.
      V. When the Lord shall build up Sion: and when his glory shall
      appear. <BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V.<I> Psalm </I>97 The Lord is King, the
      earth may be glad thereof: yea the multitude of the isles may
      be glad thereof. Alleluia.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>Saint John </I>2:1-11.<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>1 AT that time: And the
      third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother
      of Jesus was there: <BR />
      2 And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.
<BR />
      3 And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him,
      They have no wine. <BR />
      4 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine
      hour is not yet come. <BR />
      5 His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto
      you, do it. <BR />
      6 And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the
      manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three
      firkins apiece. <BR />
      7 Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they
      filled them up to the brim. <BR />
      8 And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor
      of the feast. And they bare it. <BR />
      9 When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made
      wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew
      the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,
<BR />
      10 And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth
      good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse:
      but thou hast kept the good wine until now. <BR />
      11 This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and
      manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.
<BR />
<BR />
      <B>OFFERTORY.</B> <B><I>Ps. </I>118.<I> </I></B>The right hand
      of the Lord hath the pre-eminence, the right hand of the Lord
      bringeth mighty things to pass: I shall not die, but live, and
      declare the works of the Lord. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>SECRET.<BR />
      </B>GRANT, O Lord, we pray thee, that this oblation may in such
      wise cleanse us from all our sins: that we thy servants, being
      sanctified both in body and soul, may worthily offer unto thee
      this our sacrifice. [Through.]<BR />
<BR />
      <B>COMMUNION. <I>St. John </I>2.<I> </I></B>The Lord saith unto
      them, Fill the waterpots with water, and bear unto the governor
      of the feast. When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water
      that was made wine, he saith unto the bridegroom, thou hast kept
      the good wine until now. This beginning of miracles did Jesus
      before his disciples. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      O LORD, who hast vouchsafed unto us to be made partakers of so
      great a mystery; we humbly beseech thee, that thou wouldest render
      us worthy thereby to enjoy the benefits of the same. [Through.]
