      <B>INTROIT. <I>Dicit Dominus Petro. St John </I>21<BR />
      </B>THE Lord said unto Peter: When thou wast young, thou girdest
      thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt
      be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall
      gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not: this spake
      he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. <I>Ps. </I>19.
      The heavens declare the glory of God: and the firmament sheweth
      his handy-work. V. Glory be.</P>

      <P>Gloria in excelsis <I>is not said.</I></P>

      We humbly beseech thee, Almighty God: that like as thou hast
      stablished us on the rock of the confession of thy holy Apostles;
      so thou wouldest in all our trials and adversities preserve us
      stedfast in the same. Through.</P>

      <B>The Epistle. <FONT COLOR="#000000">Acts 3:1-10</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the
      hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.<BR />
      2 And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried,
      whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called
      Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;<BR />
      3 Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked
      an alms.<BR />
      4 And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look
      on us.<BR />
      5 And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something
      of them.<BR />
      6 Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I
      have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise
      up and walk.<BR />
      7 And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately
      his feet and ankle bones received strength.<BR />
      8 And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them
      into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.<BR />
      9 And all the people saw him walking and praising God:<BR />
      10 And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful
      gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement
      at that which had happened unto him.</FONT></P>

      <P><B>The Gospel. St John 21:15-19a</B><BR />
      15 So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon,
      son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him,
      Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him,
      Feed my lambs.<BR />
      16 He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas,
      lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that
      I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.<BR />
      17 He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest
      thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third
      time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest
      all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him,
      Feed my sheep.<BR />
      18 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou
      girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when
      thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another
      shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.<BR />
      19 This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify
      God.</P>
