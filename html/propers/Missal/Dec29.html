      </I></B>REJOICE we all in the Lord, keeping holy-day in honour
      of blessed Thomas the Martyr: in whose passion the Angels rejoice
      and glorify the Son of God. <I>Ps. </I>33. Rejoice in the Lord,
      O ye righteous: for it becometh well the just to be thankful.
      V. Glory be.</P>

      </B>O GOD, who for thy Church's sake didst suffer thy Bishop
      Saint Thomas gloriously to be slain by the swords of wicked men:
      grant, we beseech thee; that all they who call upon him for succour
      may be profited by the obtaining of all that they desire. [Through]</P>

      <B>EPISTLE. Hebrews 5:1-6</B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 BRETHREN: every high priest taken from among men is ordained
      for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts
      and sacrifices for sins:<BR />
      2 Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are
      out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.<BR />
      3 And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for
      himself, to offer for sins.<BR />
      4 And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is
      called of God, as was Aaron.<BR />
      5 So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest;
      but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, today have I begotten
      thee.<BR />
      6 As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever
      after the order of Melchisedec.</FONT></P>

      the Lord. V. There was none like unto him to keep the law of

      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>St. John </I>10. I am the good shepherd:

      <P><B>GOSPEL. St John 10:11-16<BR />
      </B>11 At that time: Jesus said unto the Pharisees: I am the
      good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.<BR />
      12 But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own
      the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep,
      and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.<BR />
      13 The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth
      not for the sheep.<BR />
      14 I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of
      mine.<BR />
      15 As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I
      lay down my life for the sheep.<BR />
      16 And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also
      I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be
      one fold, and one shepherd. <I>The Creed is said on account of
      the Octave.</I></P>

      <P><B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps. </I>21. </B>Thou hast set a crown of
      pure gold upon his head, O Lord: he asked life of thee, and thou
      gavest him a long life.</P>
