      I WILL speak of thy testimonies also even before kings, and will
      not be ashamed: and my delight shall be in thy commandments,
      which I have loved exceedingly. <I>Ps. ibid. </I>Blessed are
      those that are undefiled in the way: and walk in the law of the
      Lord. V. Glory be.</P>

      O GOD, who on Mount Sinai didst give the law to Moses, and afterwards,
      through the ministry of holy Angels, didst mystically give rest
      thereon to the body of blessed Catherine thy Virgin and Martyr:
      grant, we beseech thee: that, by her intercession, we may be
      brought unto that mountain which is Christ. Who liveth and reigneth
      with thee.</P>

      <B>The Epistle. <FONT COLOR="#000000">Ecclesiasticus 51.1<BR />
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-2">[From Mass 17]</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      I will thank thee, O Lord and King, and praise thee, O God my
      saviour: I do give praise unto thy Name: for thou art my defender
      and helper, and hast preserved my body from destruction, and
      from the snare of the slanderous tongue, and from the lips that
      forge lies, and hast been mine helper against mine adversaries:
      and hast delivered me according to the multitude of thy mercies
      and greatness of thy Name, from the teeth of them that were ready
      to devour me, and out of the hands of such as sought after my
      life, and from the manifold afflictions which I had; from the
      choking of fire on every side, and from the midst of the fire
      which I kindled not; from the depth of the belly of hell, from
      an unclean tongue, and from lying words. By an accusation to
      the king from an unrighteous tongue my soul drew near even unto
      death, my life was near to the hell beneath. They compassed me
      on every side, and there was no man to help me; I looked for
      the succour of men, but there was none. Then thought I upon thy
      mercy, O Lord, and upon thy acts of old, how thou deliverest
      such as wait for thee, and savest them out of the hands of the
      enemies, O Lord our God.</FONT></P>

      ride prosperously and reign. V. Because of the word of truth,
      of meekness, and righteousness: and thy right hand shall teach
      thee terrible things.<BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. Come, O my chosen one, and in thee shall
      I set up my throne: for the King shall have pleasure in thy beauty.

      <P><B>The Gospel. St Matthew 25:1-13<BR />
      </B><FONT SIZE="-2">[From Mass 17]<BR />
      </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">1 AT that time: Jesus spake this
      parable unto his disciples: the kingdom of heaven be likened
      unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet
      the bridegroom.<BR />
      2 And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.<BR />
      3 They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with
      them:<BR />
      4 But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.<BR />
      5 While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.<BR />
      6 And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom
      cometh; go ye out to meet him.<BR />
      7 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.<BR />
      8 And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for
      our lamps are gone out.<BR />
      9 But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough
      for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for
      yourselves.<BR />
      10 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they
      that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door
      was shut.<BR />
      11 Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord,
      open to us.<BR />
      12 But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you
      not.<BR />
      13 Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour
      wherein the Son of man cometh.</FONT></P>

      Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right
      hand did stand the queen in a vesture of gold, wrought about
      with divers colours.</FONT></P>

      WE beseech thee, O Lord, let this sacrifice which we offer unto
      thee in remembrance of St. Catherine thy Virgin and Martyr, be
      unto us a release from the bonds of our sins and a bestowal of
      all the gifts of thy mercy. Through.</FONT></P>
