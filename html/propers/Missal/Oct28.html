      <P><B>INTROIT. <I>Mihi autem. Ps. </I>139<BR />
      </B>RIGHT dear are thy friends unto me, O God, and held in highest
      honour: their rule and governance is exceeding stedfast. <I>Ps.
      ibid. </I>Lord, thou hast searched me out and known me: thou
      knowest my downsitting and mine uprising. V. Glory be.</P>

      <P><BR />
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      O ALMIGHTY God, who hast built thy Church upon the foundation
      of the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the
      head corner-stone; Grant us so to be joined together in unity
      of spirit by their doctrine, that we may be made an holy temple
      acceptable unto thee; through the same Jesus Christ our Lord.
      Amen.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><B>EPISTLE. <I>Ephesians</I> 2:19.</B><BR />
      NOW therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens
      with the saints, and of the household of God; and are built upon
      the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself
      being the chief corner-stone; in whom all the building fitly
      framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: in whom
      ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through
      the Spirit.</P>

      <P><B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps. </I>45. </B>Thou shalt make them princes
      in all lands: they shall remember thy Name, O Lord. V. Instead
      of thy fathers thou shalt have children: therefore shall the
      people give thanks unto thee.<BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>Ps. </I>139. Right dear are thy friends
      unto me, O God, and held in highest honour: their rule and governance
      is exceeding stedfast. Alleluia. <BR />
      </P>

      <P><B>GOSPEL. <I>St. John</I> 15:17.</B><BR />
      THESE things I command you, that ye love one another. If the
      world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.
      If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because
      ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world,
      therefore the world hateth you. Remember the word that I said
      unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have
      persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept
      my saying, they will keep your's also. But all these things will
      they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him
      that sent me. If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had
      not had sin: but now they have no cloke for their sin. He that
      hateth me hateth my Father also. If I had not done among them
      the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but
      now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father. But
      this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is
      written in their law, They hated me without a cause. But when
      the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father,
      even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he
      shall testify of me: and ye also shall bear witness, because
      ye have been with me from the beginning.</P>

      <P><B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps</I>. 19. </B>Their sound is gone out into
      all lands: and their words into the ends of the world.</P>

      <P><B>SECRET.<BR />
      </B>GRANT, O Lord, we beseech thee: that we who venerate the
      everlasting glory of thy holy Apostles Simon and Jude, may in
      such wise be cleansed by thy holy mysteries, that we may be made
      worthier for the celebration of the same. Through.</P>

      <P>PREFACE <I>of the Apostles.</I></P>

      <P><B>COMMUNION. <I>St. Matt. </I>19.28. </B>Ye which have followed
      me shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of
      Israel.</P>

      <P><B>POSTCOMMUNION. <BR />
      </B>O LORD, who hast vouchsafed to feed us with these holy sacraments:
      we humbly pray thee; that, at the intercession of thy holy Apostles
      Simon and Jude, the mysteries which we have offered in remembrance
      of their glorious passion may be profitable unto us for the healing
      of our souls. Through.</P>

      <P>&para; <I>In Votive Masses all is said as above, but after
      Septuagesima, instead of the Alleluia, and verse following, is
      said the Tract. </I>They that sow in tears, <I>from Mass </I>6,
      Intret in conspectu, <I>from Common.</I></P>

      <P><I>In Eastertide Mass </I>10, Sancti tui <I>is said, from
      Common, with Prayers, Epistle, and Gospel as above.</I></P>
