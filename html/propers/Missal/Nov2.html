      <B>INTROIT. <I>Requiem aeternam<BR />
      </I></B>REST eternal grant unto them, O Lord: and let light perpetual
      shine upon them. <I>Ps. </I>65. Thou, O Lord, art praise in Sion,
      and unto thee shall the vow be performed in Jerusalem: thou that
      hearest the prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come. <I>Then at
      once is repeated: </I>REST eternal grant unto them, O Lord: and
      let light perpetual shine upon them.</P>

      <P><B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      O GOD, the Creator and Redeemer of all them that believe: grant
      unto the souls of thy servants and handmaidens the remission
      of all their sins; that as they have ever desired thy merciful
      pardon, so by the supplications of their brethren they may receive
      the same. Who livest and reignest with the Father in the unity
      of the Holy Ghost ever one God, world without end. Amen.</P>

      <B>EPISTLE. <FONT COLOR="#000000">1 Corinthians 15:51-57</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      51 BRETHREN; Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep,
      but we shall all be changed,<BR />
      52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump:
      for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible,
      and we shall be changed.<BR />
      53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal
      must put on immortality.<BR />
      54 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and
      this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought
      to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in
      victory.<BR />
      55 O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?<BR />
      56 The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the
      law.<BR />
      57 But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through
      our Lord Jesus Christ.</FONT></P>

      Rest eternal grant unto them, O Lord: and let light perpetual
      shine upon them. V. <I>Ps. </I>112. The righteous shall be had
      in everlasting remembrance: he will not be afraid of any evil
      tidings.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">TRACT</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000">.
      Absolve, O Lord, the souls of all the faithful departed from
      all the chains of their sins. V. That by the succour of thy grace
      they may be found worthy to escape the avenging judgement. V.
      And enjoy the bliss of everlasting life.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">SEQUENCE. <I>Dies Irae.<BR />
      </I></FONT></B>Day of wrath, and doom impending,<BR />
      David's word with Sibyl's blending:<BR />
      Heaven and earth in ashes ending!</P>

      <P>O what fear man's bosom rendeth,<BR />
      When from heaven the Judge descendeth,<BR />
      On whose sentence all dependeth!</P>

      <P>Wondrous sound the trumpet flingeth,<BR />
      Through earth's sepulchers it ringeth,<BR />
      All before the throne it bringeth.</P>

      <P>Death is struck, and nature quaking,<BR />
      All creation is awaking,<BR />
      To its Judge an answer making.</P>

      <P>Lo! the book, exactly worded,<BR />
      Wherein all hath been recorded:<BR />
      Thence shall judgment be awarded.</P>

      <P>When the Judge his seat attaineth,<BR />
      And each hidden deed arraigneth,<BR />
      Nothing unavenged remaineth.</P>

      <P>What shall I, frail man, be pleading?<BR />
      Who for me be interceding,<BR />
      When the just are mercy needing?</P>

      <P>King of majesty tremendous,<BR />
      Who dost free salvation send us,<BR />
      Fount of pity, then befriend us.</P>

      <P>Think, good Jesus, my salvation,<BR />
      Cost thy wondrous Incarnation;<BR />
      Leave me not to reprobation.</P>

      <P>Faint and weary, thou hast sought me,<BR />
      On the Cross of suffering bought me,<BR />
      Shall such grace be vainly brought me?</P>

      <P>Righteous Judge! for sin's pollution<BR />
      Grant thy gift of absolution<BR />
      Ere the day of retribution.</P>

      <P>Guilty, now I pour my moaning,<BR />
      All my shame with anguish owning;<BR />
      Spare, O God, thy suppliant groaning.</P>

      <P>Through the sinful woman shriven;<BR />
      Through the dying thief forgiven;<BR />
      Thou to me a hope hast given.</P>

      <P>Worthless are my tears and sighing,<BR />
      Yet, good Lord, in grace complying<BR />
      Rescue me from fires undying.</P>

      <P>With thy sheep a place provide me,<BR />
      From the goats afar divide me,<BR />
      To thy right hand do thou guide me.</P>

      <P>When the wicked are confounded,<BR />
      Doomed to flames of woe unbounded,<BR />
      Call me with thy Saints surrounded.</P>

      <P>Low I kneel, with heart-submission;<BR />
      See, like ashes, my contrition!<BR />
      Help me in my last condition!</P>

      <P>Ah! that day of tears and mourning! <BR />
      From the dust of earth returning,<BR />
      Man for judgment must prepare him.<BR />
<BR />
      Spare, O God, in mercy spare him:<BR />
      Lord, all pitying, Jesus blest,<BR />
      Grant them thine eternal rest. Amen.<BR />

      <P><B>GOSPEL. St John 5:25-29<BR />
      </B><FONT COLOR="#000000">25 Verily, verily, I say unto you,
      The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the
      voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.<BR />
      26 For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to
      the Son to have life in himself;<BR />
      27 And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because
      he is the Son of man.<BR />
      28 Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all
      that are in the graves shall hear his voice,<BR />
      29 And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection
      of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection
      of damnation.</FONT></P>

      O Lord Jesus Christ, King of glory, deliver the souls of all
      the faithful departed from the pains of hell, and from the bottomless
      pit: deliver them from the Lion's mouth, that hell swallow them
      not up, that they fall not into darkness: but let Michael the
      standard-bearer bring them into the holy light: Which thou didst
      promise of old unto Abraham, and his seed. V. We offer thee,
      O Lord, this sacrifice of prayer and praise: do thou receive
      it for the souls whose memory we this day recall: make them,
      O Lord, to pass from death unto life. Which thou didst promise
      of old unto Abraham and his seed.</FONT></P>

      faith of thy holy Name; so they may obtain of thee the reward
