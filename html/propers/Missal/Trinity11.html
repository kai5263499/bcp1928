      <b><font color="#7f0000" size="+1">MISSAL PROPERS:<br />
        THE 11TH SUNDAY AFTER TRINITY<br />
      </font></b>
    </center>
  </p>
  <p><b>INTROIT. <i>Deus in loco sancto suo. Ps. 68</i></b><br />
    GOD in his holy habitation,
    he is the God that maketh men to be of one mind in an house:
    he will give strength and power unto his people. <i>Ps. ibid. </i>Let God arise, and let his enemies be scattered: let them
    also that hate him flee before him. V. Glory be.</p>
  <p><b>COLLECT.</b><br />
    O GOD, who declarest thy almighty power chiefly in shewing mercy
    and pity; Mercifully grant unto us such a measure of thy grace,
    that we, running the way of thy commandments, may obtain thy
    gracious promises, and be made partakers of thy heavenly treasure;
    through Jesus Christ our Lord. AMEN.</p>
  <p><b>EPISTLE.</b><i> 1 Corinthians 15:1-11<br />
    </i>1 BRETHREN, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached
    unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;<br />
    2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached
    unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.<br />
    3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received,
    how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;<br />
    4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day
    according to the scriptures:<br />
    5 And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:<br />
    6 After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once;
    of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are
    fallen asleep.<br />
    7 After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.<br />
    8 And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out
    of due time.<br />
    9 For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be
    called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.<br />
    10 But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which
    was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly
    than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with
    me.<br />
    11 Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so
    ye believed.</p>
  <p><b>GRADUAL. <i>Ps. 28.</i> </b>My heart hath trusted in God
    and I am helped: therefore my heart danceth for joy: and in my
    song will I praise him. V. Unto thee will I cry, O Lord my Strength:
    think no scorn of me: my God, go not far from me.<br />
    Alleluia, alleluia. <i>Ps. 81. </i>Sing we merrily unto God our
    strength, make a cheerful noise unto the God of Jacob: take the
    psalm, bring hither the tabret. Alleluia.</p>
  <p><b>GOSPEL.</b><i> <b>St. Luke 18: 9-14<br />
    </b></i> 9 AT that time: JESUS spake
    this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they
    were righteous, and despised others:<br />
    10 Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee,
    and the other a publican.<br />
    11 The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank
    thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers,
    or even as this publican.<br />
    12 I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.<br />
    13 And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so
    much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying,
    God be merciful to me a sinner.<br />
    14 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather
    than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be
    abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</p>
  <p><b>OFFERTORY. </b><i>Ps. <b>30.</b></i> I will magnify thee,
    O Lord, for thou hast set me up, and not made my foes to triumph
    over me: O Lord, my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed
    me.</p>
  <p><b>SECRET.<br />
    </b>O GOD, who hast ordained a sacrifice, that we, offering the
    same to thy honour and glory, might receive thereby the healing
    of all our infirmities: mercifully grant that this our present
    offering may be made acceptable in thy sight. [Through.]</p>
  <p><b>COMMUNION. <i>Proverbs. 3. </i></b>Honour the Lord with
    thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:
    so shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall
    burst out with new wine.</p>
  <p><b>POSTCOMMUNION.<br />
    </b>WE humbly beseech thee, O Lord our God, that like as thou
    ceasest not to renew us with thy heavenly sacraments, so thou
    wouldest not fail to bestow upon us in all things the succour
    of thy mercy. [Through.]</p>
