      <B>INTROIT. <I>Loquebar. Ps. </I>119.</B><BR />
      I WILL speak of thy testimonies also, even before king, and will
      not be ashamed: and my delight shall be in thy commandments,
      which I have loved. <I>Ps. </I>117. O praise the Lord all ye
      heathen, praise him all ye nations: for his merciful kindness
      is ever more and more towards us, and the truth of the Lord endureth
      for ever. V. Glory be.</P>

      <P><B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      O GOD, who by the preaching and wondrous works of blessed Francis
      didst unite unto thy Church the peoples of India: mercifully
      grant that we who venerate his glorious merits, may likewise
      follow him in all virtuous and godly living. [Through]</P>

      <B>EPISTLE. Romans 10:9-21</B><BR />
      9 IF thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt
      believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead,
      thou shalt be saved. <BR />
      10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with
      the mouth confession is made unto salvation. <BR />
      11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall
      not be ashamed. <BR />
      12 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek:
      for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.
<BR />
      13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be
      saved. <BR />
      14 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?
      and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?
      and how shall they hear without a preacher? <BR />
      15 And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written,
      How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of
      peace, and bring glad tidings of good things! <BR />
      16 But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith,
      Lord, who hath believed our report? <BR />
      17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of
      God. <BR />
      18 But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went
      into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.
<BR />
      19 But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will
      provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a
      foolish nation I will anger you. <BR />
      20 But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that
      sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after
      me. <BR />
      21 But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth
      my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.</P>

      <P><B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps. </I>92.</B> The righteous shall flourish
      like a palm-tree: and shall spread abroad like a cedar in Libanus
      in the house of the Lord. V. To tell of thy loving-kindness early
      in the morning: and of thy truth in the night season.<BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>St. James </I>1. Blessed is the man
      that endureth temptation: for when he is tried he shall receive
      the crown of life. Alleluia.</P>

      <P><B>GOSPEL. St Mark 16:15-18</B><BR />
      15 AT that time: Jesus said unto his disciples:, Go ye into all
      the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. <BR />
      16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that
      believeth not shall be damned. <BR />
      17 And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name
      shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;
<BR />
      18 They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly
      thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick,
      and they shall recover.</P>

      <P><B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps. </I>89.</B> My truth also and my mercy
      shall be with him: and in my Name shall his horn be exalted.</P>

      <P><B>SECRET</B>.<BR />
      GRANT, we beseech thee, Almighty God: that this oblation of our
      humble service may be acceptable in thy sight to the honour of
      thy Saints, and effectual unto us for the cleansing both of body
      and soul. Through.</P>

      <P><B>COMMUNION. <I>St. Matt. </I>24:46.</B> Blessed is that
      servant whom his Lord, when he cometh, shall find watching: verily,
      I say unto you, he shall make him ruler over all his goods.</P>

      <P><B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      WE beseech thee, Almighty God: that we which have received this
      heavenly flood; may at the intercession of blessed Francis thy
      Confessor, be thereby defended against all adversities. Through.</P>
