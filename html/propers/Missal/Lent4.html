      </I><IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>REJOICE ye with Jerusalem:
      and be glad with her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with
      her, all ye that mourn for her: that ye may suck, and be satisfied
      with the breast of her consolations. <I>Ps. 122 </I>I was glad
      when the said unto me: We will go into the house of the Lord.
      V. Glory be. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      GRANT, we beseech thee, Almighty God: that we, who for our evil
      deeds do worthily deserve to be punished, by the comfort of thy
      grace may mercifully be relieved. Through our Lord and Saviour
      Jesus Christ. [Who.]<BR />
<BR />
      <B>EPISTLE. <I>Galatians </I>4:21-31<BR />
      </B>21 BRETHREN: Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law,
      do ye not hear the law? <BR />
      22 For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a
      bondmaid, the other by a freewoman. <BR />
      23 But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh;
      but he of the freewoman was by promise. <BR />
      24 Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants;
      the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which
      is Agar. <BR />
      25 For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem
      which now is, and is in bondage with her children. <BR />
      26 But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother
      of us all. <BR />
      27 For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not;
      break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate
      hath many more children than she which hath an husband. <BR />
      28 Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.
<BR />
      29 But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him
      that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now. <BR />
      30 Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman
      and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with
      the son of the freewoman. <BR />
      31 So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but
      of the free. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps. </I>122<I>. </I></B>I was glad when they said
      unto me: We will go into the house of the Lord. V. Peace be within
      thy walls, and plenteousness within thy palaces. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>TRACT. <I>Ps. </I>125<I>.</I> </B>They that put their trust
      in the Lord shall be even as the mount Sion: which may not be
      removed but standeth fast for ever. V. The hills stand about
      Jerusalem: even so standeth the Lord round about his people,
      from this time forth for evermore. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>Saint John </I>6:1-14<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>1 AT that time: Jesus
      went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias. <BR />
      2 And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles
      which he did on them that were diseased. <BR />
      3 And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his
      disciples. <BR />
      4 And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh. <BR />
      5 When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company
      come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread,
      that these may eat? <BR />
      6 And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he
      would do. <BR />
      7 Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not
      sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.
<BR />
      8 One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith
      unto him, <BR />
      9 There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two
      small fishes: but what are they among so many? <BR />
      10 And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much
      grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five
      thousand. <BR />
      11 And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he
      distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that
      were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.
<BR />
      12 When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather
      up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost. <BR />
      13 Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets
      with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained
      over and above unto them that had eaten. <BR />
      14 Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus
      did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into
      the world. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps. </I>135<I>. </I></B>O praise the Lord, for
      the Lord is gracious: O sing praises unto his Name, for it is
      lovely: whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did he in heaven and
      in earth.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>SECRET.<BR />
      </B>WE beseech thee, O Lord, mercifully to have respect unto
      these our oblations: that the same may be profitable unto us
      for our increase in all godliness, and for the attainment of
      everlasting salvation. [Through.] <BR />
<BR />
      <B>COMMUNION. <I>Ps. </I>122<I>.</I> </B>Jerusalem is built as
      a city that is at unity with itself: for thither the tribes go
      up, even the tribes of the Lord, to give thanks unto the Name
      of the Lord. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.<BR />
      </B>O LORD, who sufferest us to be partakers of thy wondrous
      mysteries: grant, we beseech thee; that by thy mercy we may be
      absolved from all our iniquities, and defended against all adversities.
      [Through.] <BR />
