      INTROIT. <I>Adorate Deum. Psalm </I>97:8,1 .<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>All ye angels of God,
      fall down, and worship before him: Sion heard of it, and rejoiced,
      and the daughters of Judah were glad. <I>Psalm ibid </I>The Lord
      is King, the earth may be glad thereof: yea, the multitude of
      the isles may be glad thereof. V. Glory be. <BR />

      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      O GOD, who knowest us to be set in the midst of so many and great
      dangers, that by reason of the frailty of our nature we cannot
      always stand upright: grant to us such strength and protection,
      as may support us in all dangers, and carry us through all temptations.
      [Through.]<BR />
<BR />
      <B>EPISTLE. <I>Romans</I> 13:1-7<BR />
      </B>1 BRETHREN: Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers.
      For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained
      of God. <BR />
      2 Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance
      of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.
<BR />
      3 For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil.
      Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good,
      and thou shalt have praise of the same: <BR />
      4 For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou
      do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword
      in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute
      wrath upon him that doeth evil. <BR />
      5 Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but
      also for conscience sake. <BR />
      6 For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's
      ministers, attending continually upon this very thing. <BR />
      7 Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute
      is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom
      honour. <BR />
<BR />
<BR />
      <B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps</I> 102.<I> </I></B>The heathen shall fear
      thy Name, O Lord: and all the kings of the earth thy majesty.
      V. When the Lord shall build up Sion: and when his glory shall
      appear. <BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V.<I> Ps </I>97<I> </I>The Lord is King,
      the earth may be glad thereof: yea the multitude of the isles
      may be glad thereof. Alleluia.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>Saint Matthew </I>8:1-13<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>1 AT that time: When he
      was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.
<BR />
      2 And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying,
      Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. <BR />
      3 And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will;
      be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. <BR />
      4 And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy
      way, show thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses
      commanded, for a testimony unto them. <BR />
      5 And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto
      him a centurion, beseeching him, <BR />
      6 And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy,
      grievously tormented. <BR />
      7 And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him. <BR />
      8 The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that
      thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and
      my servant shall be healed. <BR />
      9 For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and
      I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and
      he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it. <BR />
      10 When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed,
      Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not
      in Israel. <BR />
      11 And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and
      west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob,
      in the kingdom of heaven. <BR />
      12 But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer
      darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <BR />
      13 And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou
      hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed
      in the selfsame hour. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps </I>118.<I> </I></B>The right hand of the
      Lord hath the pre-eminence, the right hand of the Lord bringeth
      mighty things to pass: I shall not die, but live, and declare
      the works of the Lord. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>SECRET.<BR />
      </B>GRANT, we beseech thee, Almighty God: that the frailty of
      our mortal nature may by this oblation of our sacrifice, be cleansed
      from all iniquity and defended against all temptations. [Through.]
<BR />
<BR />
      <B>COMMUNION. <I>St. Luke </I>4<I>.</I></B><I> </I>All wondered
      at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      O GOD, who hast here bestowed upon us the bounty of thy heavenly
      gifts: grant, we beseech thee; that by the same we may be freed
      from all carnal and earthly desires, and ever strengthened by
      thy heavenly refreshment. [Through.]</P>
