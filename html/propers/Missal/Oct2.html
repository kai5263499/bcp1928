      <P><B>INTROIT. <I>Benedicte Dominum. Ps. </I>103.<BR />
      </B>O PRAISE the Lord, ye Angels of his, ye that excel in strength:
      ye that fulfil his commandment, and hearken unto the voice of
      his words. <I>Ps. ibid. </I>Praise the Lord, O my soul: and all
      that is within me, praise his holy name. V. Glory be.</P>

      <P><B>COLLECT</B>.<BR />
      O GOD, who of thy ineffable providence dost vouchsafe to send
      thy holy Angels to be our guardians: grant to us thy humble servants;
      that we may in this life ever be defended by their protection,
      and rejoice in their everlasting company in heaven. Through.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>For the Epistle. <FONT COLOR="#000000">Exodus 23:20-23a</FONT></B><BR />
      20 Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way,
      and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.<BR />
      21 Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he
      will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.<BR />
      22 But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I
      speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary
      unto thine adversaries.<BR />
      23 For mine Angel shall go before thee.</P>

      <P><B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps. </I>91. </B>He shall give his Angles charge
      over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. V. They shall bear thee
      in their hands, that thou hurt not thy foot against a stone.<BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>Ps. 103. </I>O praise the Lord, all
      ye his hosts, ye servants of his that do his pleasure. Alleluia.</P>

      <P><I>In Votive Masses after Septuagesima, the Tact and in Eastertide
      the </I>Alleluia <I>are from Mass 2, from the Votive Mass of
      the Holy Angels.</I></P>

      <P><B>The Gospel. St Matthew 18:1-10<BR />
      </B><FONT COLOR="#000000">1 At the same time came the disciples
      unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?<BR />
      2 And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the
      midst of them,<BR />
      3 And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and
      become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom
      of heaven.<BR />
      4 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child,
      the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.<BR />
      5 And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth
      me.<BR />
      6 But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe
      in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about
      his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.<BR />
      7 Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be
      that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!<BR />
      8 Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off,
      and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into
      life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet
      to be cast into everlasting fire.<BR />
      9 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from
      thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye,
      rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.<BR />
      10 Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for
      I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold
      the face of my Father which is in heaven.</FONT></P>
