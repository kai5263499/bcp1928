      THOU hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity: therefore

      17 He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.<BR />
      18 For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the
      Lord commendeth.<BR />
      1 Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and
      indeed bear with me.<BR />
      2 For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused
      you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin
      to Christ.</FONT></P>

      <P><B>GOSPEL. St Matthew 25:1-13a<BR />
      </B><FONT COLOR="#000000">1 The kingdom of heaven be likened
      unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet
      the bridegroom.<BR />
      2 And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.<BR />
      3 They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with
      them:<BR />
      4 But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.<BR />
      5 While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.<BR />
      6 And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom
      cometh; go ye out to meet him.<BR />
      7 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.<BR />
      8 And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for
      our lamps are gone out.<BR />
      9 But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough
      for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for
      yourselves.<BR />
      10 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they
      that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door
      was shut.<BR />
      11 Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord,
      open to us.<BR />
      12 But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you
      not.<BR />
      13 Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour.<BR />
