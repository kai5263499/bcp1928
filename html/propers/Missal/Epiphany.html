      the Lord and Ruler: and in his hand the kingdom, and power, and

      O God, who by the leading of a star didst manifest thy only-begotten
      Son to the Gentiles: mercifully grant, that we, who know thee
      now by faith, may after this life have the fruition of thy glorious

      1 For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you
      Gentiles, <BR>
      2 If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which
      is given me to you-ward: <BR>
      3 How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as
      I wrote afore in few words, <BR>
      4 Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the
      mystery of Christ) <BR>
      5 Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men,
      as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by
      the Spirit; <BR>
      6 That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body,
      and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel: <BR>
      7 Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the
      grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.
<BR>
      8 Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this
      grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable
      riches of Christ; <BR>
      9 And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery,
      which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who
      created all things by Jesus Christ: <BR>
      10 To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers
      in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold
      wisdom of God, <BR>
      11 According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ
      Jesus our Lord: <BR>
      12 In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the
      faith of him. <BR>
<BR>
      <B>GRADUAL</B>. <I>Is.</I> 60. All they from Saba shall come,
      bringing gold and incense, and shall shew forth the praises of
      the Lord. V. Arise and shine, O Jerusalem: for the glory of the
      Lord is risen upon thee.<BR>
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>St. Matt. </I>2. We have seen his star

      <B>GOSPEL. <I>St. Matthew </I>2:1-12<BR>
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></B>1 Now when Jesus was born
      in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold,
      there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, <BR>
      2 Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have
      seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him. <BR>
      3 When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled,
      and all Jerusalem with him. <BR>
      4 And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes
      of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should
      be born. <BR>
      5 And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it
      is written by the prophet, <BR>
      6 And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least
      among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor,
      that shall rule my people Israel. <BR>
      7 Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, inquired
      of them diligently what time the star appeared. <BR>
      8 And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently
      for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word
      again, that I may come and worship him also. <BR>
      9 When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star,
      which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and
      stood over where the young child was. <BR>
      10 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great
      joy. <BR>
      11 And when they were come into the house, they saw the young
      child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him:
      and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto
      him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh. <BR>
      12 And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return
      to Herod, they departed into their own country another way. <BR>
<BR>
      <B>OFFERTORY. Ps. 72.</B> The kings of Tarshish and of the isles
      shall give presents: the kings of Arabia and Saba shall bring
      gifts: all kings shall fall down before him, all nations shall
      do him service.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>SECRET</B>.<BR>
      We beseech thee, O Lord, mercifully to look upon the oblations
      of thy Church: wherein no longer offering gold and frankincense
      and myrrh, we sacrifice and receive him, who by those gifts was
      mystically signified, even Jesus Christ thy Son our Lord. Who
      liveth and reigneth with thee.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>COMMUNION. <I>St. Matt. </I>2. </B>We have seen his star in
      the East, and are come with offerings to worship the Lord.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION</B><BR>
      Grant, we beseech thee, Almighty God: that we, which here have
      celebrated thy holy mysteries, may in all purity of heart and
      mind receive the benefits of the same. [Through.]<BR>
