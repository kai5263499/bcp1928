      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>WHILE all things were
      in quiet silence, and night was in the midst of her swift course,
      thine almighty Word, O Lord, leaped down from heaven out of thy
      royal throne. <I>Ps </I>93<I>. </I>The Lord is King, and hath
      put on glorious apparel: the Lord hath put on his apparel and
      girded himself with strength. V. Glory be. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      ALMIGHTY God, who hast poured upon us the new light of thine
      incarnate Word: grant that the same light enkindled in our hearts
      may shine forth in our lives; Through Jesus Christ our Lord.
      AMEN. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>FOR EPISTLE. <I>Isaiah </I>61:1-3</B><BR />
      1 The spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath
      anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent
      me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives,
      and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; <BR />
      2 To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of
      vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn; <BR />
      3 To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them
      beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of
      praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called
      trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might
      be glorified. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps</I> 45.<I> </I></B>Thou art fairer than the
      children of men: full of grace are thy lips. V. My heart is inditing
      of a good matter, I speak of the things which I have made unto
      the King: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.<BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V.<I> Ps</I> 93. Lord is King and hath put
      on glorious apparel: the Lord hath put on his apparel and girded
      himself with strength. Alleluia<BR />
<BR />
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>Saint Matthew</I> 2:19-23<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>19 WHEN Herod was dead,
      behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in
      Egypt, <BR />
      20 Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and
      go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the
      young child's life. <BR />
      21 And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and
      came into the land of Israel. <BR />
      22 But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the
      room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding,
      being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts
      of Galilee: <BR />
      23 And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might
      be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called
      a Nazarene. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps </I>93.<I> </I></B>God hath made the round
      world so sure, that it cannot be moved: ever since the world
      began hath thy seat, O God, been prepared: thou art from everlasting.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>SECRET.</B><BR />
      GRANT, we beseech thee, Almighty God, that these gifts which
      we offer in the sight of thy divine majesty, may obtain for us
      grace to serve thee in this life with all godliness, and bring
      us in the end to everlasting felicity. Through.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>COMMUNION. <I>St. Matthew </I>2.<I> </I></B>Take the young
      Child and his Mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they
      are dead which sought the young Child's life. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      GRANT, O Lord, that by the operation of these thy mysteries,
      we may be cleansed from all our sins, and obtain that which we
      have asked according to thy will. [Through.]</P>
