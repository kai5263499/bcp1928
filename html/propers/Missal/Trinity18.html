    <p><b>GOSPEL.</b> <i>St Matthew 22:34-46</i><br />
      34 WHEN the Pharisees had
      heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered
      together.<br />
      35 Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question,
      tempting him, and saying,<br />
      36 Master, which is the great commandment in the law?<br />
      37 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
      all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.<br />
      38 This is the first and great commandment.<br />
      39 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour
      as thyself.<br />
      40 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.<br />
      41 While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,<br />
      42 Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say
      unto him, The son of David.<br />
      43 He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him
      Lord, saying,<br />
      44 The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till
      I make thine enemies thy footstool?<br />
      45 If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?<br />
      46 And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any
      man from that day forth ask him any more questions.<br />
        <br />
        <b>OFFERTORY<i>. </i>Exod. 24.</b> Moses builded an altar unto
      the Lord, and offered burnt offerings upon it, and sacrificed
      peace offerings: and he made an evening sacrifice for a sweet-smelling
      savour unto the Lord God, in the eyes of the children of Israel.<br />

    <p><b>SECRET.</b><br />
      Almighty<b> </b>God, we humbly beseech thy majesty: that we which
      here perform these holy mysteries may thereby be absolved from
      all our former sins, and evermore defended against all temptations.
