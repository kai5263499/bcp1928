      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></B>Unto us a Child is born,
      unto us a Son is given: and the government shall be upon his
      shoulder; and his Name shall be called Angel of mighty counsel.
      Ps. 98. O sing unto the Lord a new song: for he hath done marvellous
      things. V. Glory be.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR>
      Almighty God, who madest thy blessed Son to be circumcised, and
      obedient to the law for man: grant us the true circumcision of
      the Spirit; that our hearts, and all our members, being mortified
      from all worldly and carnal lusts, we may in all things obey
      thy blessed will. Through the same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
      [Who.]<BR>

      <B>EPISTLE. <I>Philippians 2:9-13</I></B><BR>
      9 BRETHREN: God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a
      name which is above every name: <BR>
      10 That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things
      in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; <BR>
      11 And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is
      Lord, to the glory of God the Father. <BR>
      12 Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in
      my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your
      own salvation with fear and trembling. <BR>
      13 For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do
      of his good pleasure. <BR>
<BR>
      <B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps</I>. 98.</B> All the ends of the world have
      seen the salvation of our God: O be joyful in God, all ye lands.
      V. The Lord hath declared his salvation: in the sight of the
      heathen hath he openly shewed his righteousness.<BR>
      Alleluia. alleluia. V. <I>Heb. </I>I. God, who at sundry times
      and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by
      the Prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son.
      Alleluia.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>St. Luke </I>2:15-21<BR>
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></B>15 And it came to pass,
      as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds
      said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see
      this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known
      unto us. <BR>
      16 And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and
      the babe lying in a manger. <BR>
      17 And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying
      which was told them concerning this child. <BR>
      18 And all they that heard it wondered at those things which
      were told them by the shepherds. <BR>
      19 But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.
<BR>
      20 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for
      all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto
      them. <BR>
      21 And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising
      of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of
      the angel before he was conceived in the womb. <BR>
<BR>
      <B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps</I>. 89.</B> The heavens are thine, the earth
      also is thine: thou hast laid the foundations of the round world,
      and all that therein is: righteousness and equity are the habitation
      of thy seat.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>SECRET.</B><BR>
      We beseech thee, O Lord, graciously to accept these our prayers
      and oblations: that we being cleansed by these heavenly mysteries,
      may obtain of thy great mercy the fulfilment of all our desires.
