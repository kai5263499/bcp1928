      <P><B>INTROIT. <I>Viri Galilaei. Acts I.<BR />
      </I></B><IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" />YE MEN of Galilee, why stand
      ye gazing up into heaven? Alleluia : in like manner as ye have
      seen him going up into heaven, so shall he come again. Alleluia,
      alleluia, alleluia. Ps. 47. O clap your hands together, all ye
      people : O sing unto God with the voice of melody. V. Glory be.</P>

      <P><B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      GRANT, we beseech thee, Almighty God : that like as we do believe
      thy only begotten Son our Lord Jesus Christ to have ascended
      into the heavens ; so we may also in heart and mind thither ascend,
      and with him continually dwell. Who liveth and reigneth with
      thee and the Holy Ghost, one God, world without end. Amen</P>

      <P><B>FOR THE EPISTLE. <I>Acts 1:1-11<BR />
      </I></B>1 The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all
      that Jesus began both to do and teach,<BR />
      2 Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through
      the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom
      he had chosen:<BR />
      3 To whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many
      infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking
      of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:<BR />
      4 And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that
      they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise
      of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me.<BR />
      5 For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized
      with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.<BR />
      6 When they therefore were come together, they asked of him,
      saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom
      to Israel?<BR />
      7 And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times
      or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.<BR />
      8 But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come
      upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem,
      and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part
      of the earth.<BR />
      9 And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he
      was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.<BR />
      10 And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went
      up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;<BR />
      11 Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up
      into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into
      heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into
      heaven.</P>

      <P><B>GRADUAL. </B>Alleluia, alleluia. V. Ps. 47. God is gone
      up with a merry noise and the Lord with the sound of the trump,
      alleluia. V. Ps. 68. The Lord is among them as in the holy place
      of Sinai, he is gone up on high ; he hath led captivity captive.
      Alleluia.</P>

      <P><B>GOSPEL <I>St. Luke </I>24:49-53</B><BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /> 49 Jesus said:
      behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye
      in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from
      on high.<BR />
      50 And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up
      his hands, and blessed them.<BR />
      51 And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted
      from them, and carried up into heaven.<BR />
      52 And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great
      joy:<BR />
      53 And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing
      God. Amen.</P>

      <P><I>&para; When the Gospel has been said, the Paschal Candle
      shall be put out, nor shall it be lighted again, save on Whitsun
      Eve at the blessing of the Font. The Creed is said.</I></P>

      <P><B>OFFERTORY.</B> Ps. 47. God is gone up with a merry noise
      : and the Lord with the sound of the trump, alleluia.</P>

      <P><B>SECRET.</B><BR />
      ACCEPT. O Lord, we pray thee, the oblations which, in remembrance
      of the glorious Ascension of thy Son, we do offer unto thee :
      and mercifully grant that we, being delivered from all perils
      in this life ;present, may attain in the end unto life everlasting.
      Through the same.</P>

      <P>Preface and Canon <I>of the Ascension, which shall be said
      until Whitsun Eve exclusive.</I></P>

      <P><B>COMMUNION</B>. Ps. 68. Sing ye to the Lord, who ascended
      to the heaven of heavens, to the sunrising, alleluia.</P>

      <P><B>POSTCOMMUNION</B>.<BR />
      GRANT, we beseech thee, Almighty and merciful God : that we which
      have outwardly received these holy mysteries, may inwardly be
      made partakers of the benefit of the same. Through.</P>

      <P><I>&para; Within the Octave of the Ascension Mass is said
      of the Ascension, unless a double or semidouble Feast occur,
      in which case Mass is said of the Feast, with a Commemoration
      of the Octave. But on a Simple, only a Commemoration of it is
      made. After the Colle</I>ct for the Day, the second Collect is
      said of St. Mary, O Lord God Almighty, <I>and the third for the
      Church, as given in the </I>Seasonal Prayers <I>after Low Sunday.<BR />
