          INTROIT. <i>Dicit Dominus. Jer. </i>29.<br />
      </b>THUS saith the Lord:
      I know the thoughts that I think toward you, thoughts of peace,
      and not of evil: ye shall call upon me, and I will hearken unto
      you: and will turn away your captivity from all the nations. <i>Ps. </i>85. Lord, thou art become gracious unto thy land:
      thou hast turned away the captivity of Jacob. V. Glory be.</p>
    <p><b>COLLECT.<br />
      </b>O LORD, we beseech thee, absolve thy people from their offences:
      that through thy bountiful goodness, we may all be delivered
      from the bands of those sins, which by our frailty we have committed.
      Grant this, O heavenly Father, for the sake of Jesus Christ,
      our blessed Lord and Saviour. [Who.]</p>
    <p><b>EPISTLE. <i>Colossians 1:3-12<br />
      </i></b>3 WE give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus
      Christ, praying always for you, <br />
      4 Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love
      which ye have to all the saints, <br />
      5 For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye
      heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel; <br />
      6 Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth
      forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of
      it, and knew the grace of God in truth: <br />
      7 As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who
      is for you a faithful minister of Christ; <br />
      8 Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit. <br />
      9 For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease
      to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the
      knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; <br />
      10 That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being
      fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge
      of God; <br />
      11 Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power,
      unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness; <br />
      12 Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to
      be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:</p>
    <p><b>GRADUAL. <i>Ps. </i>44.</b> It is thou, O Lord, that savest
      us from our enemies: and puttest them to confusion that hate
      us. V. We make our boast of God all day long, and will praise
      thy Name for ever.<br />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <i>Ps. </i>130. Out of the deep have I
      called unto thee, O Lord: Lord, hear my voice. Alleluia.</p>
    <p><b>GOSPEL. <i>St. Matthew 9:18-26<br />
      </i></b>18 WHILE Jesus spake
      these things unto John's disciples, behold, there came a certain
      ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead:
      but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live. <br />
      19 And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples. <br />
      20 And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of
      blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his
      garment: <br />
      21 For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment,
      I shall be whole. <br />
      22 But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said,
      Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole.
      And the woman was made whole from that hour. <br />
      23 And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels
      and the people making a noise, <br />
      24 He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but
      sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn. <br />
      25 But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her
      by the hand, and the maid arose. <br />
      26 And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.</p>
    <p><b>OFFERTORY. <i>Ps. </i>130.</b> Out of the deep have I called
      unto thee, O Lord: Lord, hear my voice: out of the deep have
      I called unto thee, O Lord.</p>
    <p><b>SECRET.<br />
      </b>WE offer unto thee, O Lord, this sacrifice of praise to the
      increasing of our faithfulness in thy service: and we humbly
      beseech thee, that although we be unworthy of the gifts that
      thou bestowest, yet thou wouldest of thy mercy accomplish in
      us the effectual working of the same. Through.</p>
    <p><b>COMMUNION. <i>St. Mark </i>11.</b> Therefore I say unto
      you, what things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that
      ye receive them, and ye shall have them.</p>
    <p><b>POSTCOMMUNION.<br />
      </b>GRANT, we beseech thee, O Lord our God: that we, whom thou
      hast made partakers of heavenly gladness, may by thee be defended
      from all earthly perils. Through.
