    <p><b>INTROIT. <i>In voluntate tua.</i></b><br />
      O LORD, the whole world is
      in thy power, and there is no man that can gainsay thee: for
      thou hast made heaven and earth, and all the wondrous things
      under the heaven: thou art Lord of all things. <i>Ps. 119 </i>Blessed
      are those that are undefiled in the way: and walk in the law
      of the Lord. V. Glory be.</p>
    <p><b>COLLECT.</b><br />
      GRANT, we beseech thee, merciful Lord, to thy faithful people
      pardon and peace: that they may be cleansed from all their sins,
      and serve thee with a quiet mind. Through Jesus Christ our Lord.
      AMEN</p>

      10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power
      of his might. <br />
      11 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand
      against the wiles of the devil. <br />
      12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities,
      against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world,
      against spiritual wickedness in high places. <br />
      13 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may
      be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to
      stand. <br />
      14 Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth,
      and having on the breastplate of righteousness; <br />
      15 And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; <br />
      16 Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall
      be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. <br />
      17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit,
      which is the word of God: <br />
      18 Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit,
      and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication
      for all saints; <br />
      19 And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may
      open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel, <br />
      20 For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may
      speak boldly, as I ought to speak.</p>
    <p><b>GRADUAL. <i>Ps. </i>9.</b> 0 LORD, thou hast been our refuge,
      from one generation to another. <br />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V.<i> Ps. 114 </i>When Israel came out of
      Egypt, and the house of Jacob from among the strange people Alleluia.</p>
    <p><b>GOSPEL. <i>St. John 4:46-54</i></b><br />
      46 There was a certain nobleman,
      whose son was sick at Capernaum. <br />
      47 When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee,
      he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and
      heal his son: for he was at the point of death. <br />
      48 Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders,
      ye will not believe. <br />
      49 The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die. <br />
      50 Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the
      man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he
      went his way. <br />
      51 And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told
      him, saying, Thy son liveth. <br />
      52 Then inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend.
      And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever
      left him. <br />
      53 So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which
      Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and
      his whole house. <br />
      54 This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was
      come out of Judaea into Galilee.</p>
    <p><b>OFFERTORY.</b> <b><i>Job </i>1.<i> </i></b>There was a
      man in the land of Uz whose name was Job: and that man was perfect
      and upright, and one that feared God: and Satan sought to tempt
      him: and power was given him by the LORD over his possessions,
      and over his flesh: and he destroyed all his substance, and his
      sons: and he smote his flesh with sore boils. <br />
        <br />
        <b>SECRET.</b><br />
      WE BESEECH thee, O Lord, that these holy mysteries may in such
      wise bestow upon us thy heavenly healing, that our hearts may
      thereby be cleansed from all their iniquities. [Through.]</p>
    <p><b>COMMUNION. <i>Ps. 119.</i></b> My soul hath longed for
      thy salvation, and I have a good hope because of thy word: when
      wilt thou be avenged of them that persecute me? They persecute
      me falsely, O be thou my help, O Lord my God.</p>
    <p><b>POSTCOMMUNION.</b><br />
      O LORD, who dost vouchsafe to feed us with these holy gifts:
      grant we beseech thee: that we may be ever rendered worthy of
      the same, by walking obediently after thy commandments. [Through.]</p>
