      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">EPISTLE</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000">.
      <I>Hebrews 9:16-28</I><BR>
      16 BRETHREN: where a testament is, there must also of necessity
      be the death of the testator.<BR>
      17 For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise
      it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.<BR>
      18 Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without
      blood.<BR>
      19 For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people
      according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats,
      with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both
      the book, and all the people,<BR>
      20 Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath
      enjoined unto you.<BR>
      21 Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and
      all the vessels of the ministry.<BR>
      22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and
      without shedding of blood is no remission.<BR>
      23 It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in
      the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things
      themselves with better sacrifices than these.<BR>
      24 For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands,
      which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now
      to appear in the presence of God for us:<BR>
      25 Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest
      entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;<BR>
      26 For then must he often have suffered since the foundation
      of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared
      to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.<BR>
      27 And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this
      the judgment:<BR>
      28 So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto
      them that look for him shall he appear the second time without
      sin unto salvation.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The <B>PASSION</B> of our Lord Jesus
      Christ, according to Luke.<BR>
      1 Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called
      the Passover.<BR>
      2 And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill
      him; for they feared the people.<BR>
      3 Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the
      number of the twelve.<BR>
      4 And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and
      captains, how he might betray him unto them.<BR>
      5 And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.<BR>
      6 And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto
      them in the absence of the multitude.<BR>
      7 Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must
      be killed.<BR>
      8 And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover,
      that we may eat.<BR>
      9 And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?<BR>
      10 And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the
      city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water;
      follow him into the house where he entereth in.<BR>
      11 And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master
      saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat
      the passover with my disciples?<BR>
      12 And he shall show you a large upper room furnished: there
      make ready.<BR>
      13 And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they
      made ready the passover.<BR>
      14 And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles
      with him.<BR>
      15 And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this
      passover with you before I suffer:<BR>
      16 For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until
      it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.<BR>
      17 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this,
      and divide it among yourselves:<BR>
      18 For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine,
      until the kingdom of God shall come.<BR>
      19 And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave
      unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this
      do in remembrance of me.<BR>
      20 Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the
      new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.<BR>
      21 But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me
      on the table.<BR>
      22 And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but
      woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!<BR>
      23 And they began to inquire among themselves, which of them
      it was that should do this thing.<BR>
      24 And there was also a strife among them, which of them should
      be accounted the greatest.<BR>
      25 And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise
      lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them
      are called benefactors.<BR>
      26 But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you,
      let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth
      serve.<BR>
      27 For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that
      serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as
      he that serveth.<BR>
      28 Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.<BR>
      29 And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed
      unto me;<BR>
      30 That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit
      on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.<BR>
      31 And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired
      to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:<BR>
      32 But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when
      thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.<BR>
      33 And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both
      into prison, and to death.<BR>
      34 And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this
      day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.<BR>
      35 And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and
      scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.<BR>
      36 Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let
      him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword,
      let him sell his garment, and buy one.<BR>
      37 For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be
      accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors:
      for the things concerning me have an end.<BR>
      38 And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said
      unto them, It is enough.<BR>
      39 And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of
      Olives; and his disciples also followed him.<BR>
      40 And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that
      ye enter not into temptation.<BR>
      41 And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled
      down, and prayed,<BR>
      42 Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me:
      nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.<BR>
      43 And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening
      him.<BR>
      44 And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat
      was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.<BR>
      45 And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples,
      he found them sleeping for sorrow,<BR>
      46 And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter
      into temptation.<BR>
      47 And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was
      called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near
      unto Jesus to kiss him.<BR>
      48 But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of
      man with a kiss?<BR>
      49 When they which were about him saw what would follow, they
      said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?<BR>
      50 And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and
      cut off his right ear.<BR>
      51 And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched
      his ear, and healed him.<BR>
      52 Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the
      temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out,
      as against a thief, with swords and staves?<BR>
      53 When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth
      no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of
      darkness.<BR>
      54 Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the
      high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.<BR>
      55 And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall,
      and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.<BR>
      56 But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly
      looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.<BR>
      57 And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.<BR>
      58 And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art
      also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.<BR>
      59 And about the space of one hour after another confidently
      affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for
      he is a Galilaean.<BR>
      60 And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately,
      while he yet spake, the cock crew.<BR>
      61 And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered
      the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock
      crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.<BR>
      62 And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.<BR>
      63 And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.<BR>
      64 And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the
      face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?<BR>
      65 And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.<BR>
      66 And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the
      chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into
      their council, saying,<BR>
      67 Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I
      tell you, ye will not believe:<BR>
      68 And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.<BR>
      69 Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the
      power of God.<BR>
      70 Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said
      unto them, Ye say that I am.<BR>
      71 And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves
      have heard of his own mouth.</FONT></P>
