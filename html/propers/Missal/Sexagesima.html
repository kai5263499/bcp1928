      INTROIT. <I>Exsurge. Psalm </I>44:23, 25,26, 1<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>UP, Lord, why sleepest
      thou? Awake, and be not absent from us for ever: wherefore hidest
      thou thy face? and forgettest our misery and trouble? Our belly
      cleaveth unto the ground: arise, and help us, and deliver us.
      <I>Ps. ibid. </I>O God, we have heard with our ears: our fathers
      have declared unto us. V. Glory be. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      O LORD God, who seest that we put not our trust in anything that
      we do: mercifully grant that by thy power, we may be defended
      against all adversity. Through Jesus Christ our Lord. AMEN. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>EPISTLE. 2 <I>Corinthians</I> 11:19-31<BR />
      </B>19 For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.
<BR />
      20 For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour
      you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite
      you on the face. <BR />
      21 I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak.
      Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am
      bold also. <BR />
      22 Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are
      they the seed of Abraham? so am I. <BR />
      23 Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more;
      in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons
      more frequent, in deaths oft. <BR />
      24 Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.
<BR />
      25 Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I
      suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;
<BR />
      26 In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers,
      in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in
      perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in
      the sea, in perils among false brethren; <BR />
      27 In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger
      and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness. <BR />
      28 Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon
      me daily, the care of all the churches. <BR />
      29 Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn
      not? <BR />
      30 If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern
      mine infirmities. <BR />
      31 The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed
      for evermore, knoweth that I lie not. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>GRADUAL. <I>Psalm </I>83:18, 13.</B> Let the heathen know
      that thou, whose Name is Jehovah: art only the Most Highest over
      all the earth. V. O my God, make them like unto a wheel: and
      as the stubble before the wind.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>TRACT.</B> <B><I>Psalm </I>60:2, 4, 5.</B> Thou hast moved
      the land, O Lord, and divided it. V. Heal the sores thereof,
      for it shaketh. V. That they may triumph because of the truth:
      that thy beloved may be delivered. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>Saint Luke</I> 8:4-15<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>4 And when much people
      were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city,
      he spake by a parable: <BR />
      5 A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell
      by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the
      air devoured it. <BR />
      6 And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up,
      it withered away, because it lacked moisture. <BR />
      7 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it,
      and choked it. <BR />
      8 And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit
      an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried,
      He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. <BR />
      9 And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable
      be? <BR />
      10 And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of
      the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they
      might not see, and hearing they might not understand. <BR />
      11 Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. <BR />
      12 Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the
      devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they
      should believe and be saved. <BR />
      13 They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive
      the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while
      believe, and in time of temptation fall away. <BR />
      14 And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they
      have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and
      pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection. <BR />
      15 But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and
      good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit
      with patience. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>OFFERTORY. <I>Psalm </I>17:5,6,7.<I> </I></B>O hold thou up
      my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not: incline thine
      ear to me, and hearken unto my words: shew thy marvellous loving-kindness,
      O Lord, thou that art the Saviour of them which put their trust
      in thee. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>SECRET.<BR />
      </B>WE beseech thee, O Lord, that this sacrifice, which we offer
      unto thee, may evermore avail to quicken and defend us. Through.
<BR />
<BR />
      <B>COMMUNION. <I>Psalm </I>43:4.</B> I will go unto the altar
      of God: even unto the God of my joy and gladness. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      WE humbly beseech thee, Almighty God: that we whom thou dost
      vouchsafe to regenerate with thy holy sacraments; may continually
      serve thee in all virtuous and godly living. Through.</P>
