      ye, tell this, alleluia: utter it even to the end of the earth:
      say ye, the Lord hath redeemed his people, alleluia, alleluia.
      <I>Ps. 66</I> O be joyful in God, all ye lands, sing praises
      unto the honour of his Name: make his praise to be glorious.
      V. Glory be.</P>

      <P>COLLECT.<BR />
      O LORD, from whom all good things do come; grant to us thy humble
      servants, that by thy holy inspiration, we may think those things
      that are good, and by thy merciful guiding may perform the same;
      through our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</P>

      <P><I>Seasonal Prayers as given after Low Sunday.</I></P>

      <P><B>EPISTLE. <I>St. James 1:22-27<BR />
      </I></B>22 Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers
      only, deceiving your own selves.<BR />
      23 For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is
      like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:<BR />
      24 For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway
      forgetteth what manner of man he was.<BR />
      25 But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth
      therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work,
      this man shall be blessed in his deed.<BR />
      26 If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not
      his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion
      is vain.<BR />
      27 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this,
      To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to
      keep himself unspotted from the world.<BR />
<BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. Christ is risen, and hath shewed light
      unto us, whom he hath redeemed with his most precious Blood.
      Alleluia. <I>V.</I> <I>St. John 16 </I>I came forth from the
      Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world,
      and go to the Father. Alleluia.<BR />
      .<BR />
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>Saint John 16:23-33</I></B><BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /> 23 AT that time, Jesus said
      unto his disciples: Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever
      ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.<BR />
      24 Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall
      receive, that your joy may be full.<BR />
      25 These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time
      cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but
      I shall show you plainly of the Father.<BR />
      26 At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you,
      that I will pray the Father for you:<BR />
      27 For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me,
      and have believed that I came out from God.<BR />
      28 I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world:
      again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.<BR />
      29 His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly,
      and speakest no proverb.<BR />
      30 Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest
      not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou
      camest forth from God.<BR />
      31 Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?<BR />
      32 Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be
      scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and
      yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.<BR />
      33 These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have
      peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good
      cheer; I have overcome the world.</P>

      <P><B>OFFERTORY.</B> <B><I>Psalm 66.</I></B><I> </I>O PRAISE
      our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard:
      who holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to slip:
      praised be God, who hath not cast out my prayer, nor turned his
      mercy from me, alleluia.</P>

      <P><B>SECRET.<BR />
      </B>WE BESEECH thee, O Lord, to accept the prayers and oblations
      of thy faithful people: that through this observance of our bounden
      devotion we may attain to the glory of thy heavenly kingdom.
      [Through.]</P>

      <P><B>COMMUNION. <I>Ps. 96</I></B> O SING unto the Lord, alleluia:
      sing unto the Lord, and praise his Name, be telling of his salvation
      from day to day. alleluia, alleluia.</P>

      <P><B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      GRANT, we beseech thee, O Lord: that we, whom thou hast fulfilled
      with the bounty of thy heavenly banquet, may evermore desire
      those things that are according to thy will, and effectually
      obtain all things that we desire. Through.<BR />
