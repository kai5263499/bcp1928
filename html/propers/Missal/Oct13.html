      <B>Introit. <I>Os justi. Ps 37<BR />
      </I></B>THE mouth of the righteous is exercised in wisdom: and
      his tongue will be talking of judgement: the law of his God is
      in his heart (alleluia, alleluia). <I>Ps. ibid. </I>Fret not
      thyself because of the ungodly: neither be thou envious against
      the evildoers. V. Glory be.</P>

      O GOD, who didst bestow upon thy blessed Confessor King Edward
      the crown of everlasting glory: grant us, we pray thee; so to
      venerate him on earth, that we may be found worthy to reign with
      him in heaven. Through.</P>

      <P><BR />
      <B>The Epistle. <FONT COLOR="#000000">Ecclesiasticus 31:8-11</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      8 Blessed is the man that is found without blemish: and hath
      not gone after gold.<BR />
      9 Who is he? and we will call him blessed: for wonderful things
      hath he done among his people.<BR />
      10 Who hath been tried thereby and found perfect? Then let him
      glory. Who might offend and hath not offended? or done evil,
      and hath not done it?<BR />
      11 His goods shall be established, and the congregation shall
      declare his alms.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Gradual. <I>Ps. 92. </I></FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000">The righteous shall flourish like a palm-tree:
      and shall spread abroad like a cedar in Libanus in the house
      of the Lord. V. To tell of thy loving-kindness early in the morning:
      and of thy truth in the night-season.<BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>St. James I. </I>Blessed is the man
      that endureth temptation: for when he is tried he shall receive
      the crown of life. Alleluia.</FONT></P>

      <P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">After Septuagesima, instead of the
      </FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#000000">Alleluia<I>, and verse following,
      is said:</I></FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">TRACT. <I>Ps. 112. </I></FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord: he
      hath great delight in his commandments. V. His seed shall b mighty
      upon earth: the generation of the faithful shall be blessed.
      V. Riches and plenteousness shall be in his house: and his righteousness
      endureth for ever.</FONT></P>

      <P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">In Eastertide, instead of the Gradual,
      is said:</FONT></I></P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>St James I.
      </I>Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he

      <P><B>The Gospel. St Luke 12:35-50<BR />
      </B><FONT COLOR="#000000">35 Let your loins be girded about,
      and your lights burning;<BR />
      36 And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord,
      when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and
      knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.<BR />
      37 Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall
      find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself,
      and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve
      them.<BR />
      38 And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third
      watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.<BR />
      39 And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known
      what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not
      have suffered his house to be broken through.<BR />
      40 Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an
      hour when ye think not.</FONT></P>

      <P><B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps. 89 </I></B>My truth also and my mercy
      shall be with him: and in my Name shall his horn be exalted.
      (alleluia)</P>

      <P><B>SECRET.<BR />
      </B>Grant, we beseech thee, O Lord, that we who, trusting in
      this our sacrifice of praise, do offer it before thee to the
      honour of thy Saints, may by the same be delivered from all evils
      both in this life and in that which is to come. Through.</P>

      <P><B>COMMUNION. <I>St. Matthew 24 </I></B>Blessed is that servant
      whom his lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say
      unto you, that he shall make him ruler over all his goods. (Alleluia).</P>

      <P><B>POSTCOMMUNION.<BR />
      &nbsp;</B>O GOD, who hast vouchsafed to feed us with heavenly
      food; may, at the intercession of thy holy Confessor Saint Edward,
      be thereby defended against all adversities. Through.</P>
