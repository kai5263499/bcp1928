      THE FIFTH SUNDAY IN LENT<BR />
      COMMONLY CALLED PASSION SUNDAY</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

      <P><CENTER><I>Sunday of I class, Semidouble.</I></CENTER></P>

      <P><CENTER><I>Station at St. Peter's.</I></CENTER></P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">INTROIT. <I>Judica me. Ps. </I>43<I>,</I></FONT></B><BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" />Give sentence with me, O God,
      and defend my cause against the ungodly people: O deliver my
      soul from the deceitful and wicked man: for thou art the God
      of my strength. <I>Ps. Ibid. </I>O send out thy light and thy
      truth, that they may lead me: and bring me unto thy holy hill,
      and to thy dwelling. Give sentence with me.</P>

      <P>&para; Glory be to the Father<I> is not said at the Introit
      from henceforth until Easter, except upon a feast day, if any
      shall occur; but the Psalm being ended, the Introit is repeated
      straightway, up to the beginning of the Psalm.</I></P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">COLLECT.</FONT></B><BR />
      We beseech thee, Almighty God, mercifully to look upon thy people:
      that by thy great goodness they may be governed and preserved
      evermore, both in body and soul. Through Jesus Christ our Lord.
      [who.]</P>

      <P><I>&para; Only one Seasonal Prayer is said from this day forth
      in Masses of the Season; according to the Latin Rite this 2nd
      Collect is for the church (as on Dec. 30th), until Maundy Thursday;
      but according to the Prayer-book, as follows until Holy Week:</I></P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">EPISTLE. <I>Hebrews </I>9:11-15.</FONT></B><BR />
      11 BRETHREN: Christ being come an high priest of good things
      to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with
      hands, that is to say, not of this building;<BR />
      12 Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood
      he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal
      redemption for us.<BR />
      13 For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an
      heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of
      the flesh:<BR />
      14 How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal
      Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience
      from dead works to serve the living God?<BR />
      15 And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament,
      that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions
      that were under the first testament, they which are called might
      receive the promise of eternal inheritance.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">GOSPEL. <I>St. John </I>8:46-59.</FONT></B><BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" />46 AT that time: Jesus said;
      Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why
      do ye not believe me?<BR />
      47 He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them
      not, because ye are not of God.<BR />
      48 Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well
      that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?<BR />
      49 Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father,
      and ye do dishonour me.<BR />
      50 And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and
      judgeth.<BR />
      51 Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he
      shall never see death.<BR />
      52 Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a
      devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If
      a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.<BR />
      53 Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and
      the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?<BR />
      54 Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing:
      it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is
      your God:<BR />
      55 Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should
      say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know
      him, and keep his saying.<BR />
      56 Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it,
      and was glad.<BR />
      57 Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years
      old, and hast thou seen Abraham?<BR />
      58 Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before
      Abraham was, I am.<BR />
      59 Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself,
      and went out of the temple.</P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">GRADUAL. <I>Ps. </I>l43.</FONT></B>
      Deliver me, O Lord, from mine enemies: teach me to do the thing
      that pleaseth thee. V. Ps. 18. It is the Lord that delivereth
      me from my cruel enemies, and setteth me up above mine adversaries:
      thou shalt rid me from the wicked man.</P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">TRACT. <I>Ps. </I>129<I>.</I></FONT></B><I>
      </I>Many a time have they fought against me from my youth up.
      V. May Israel now say: yea many a time have they vexed me from
      my youth up. V. But they have not prevailed against me: the plowers
      plowed upon my back. V. And made long furrows: but the righteous
      Lord hath hewn the snares of the ungodly in pieces.</P>

      Grant, O Lord, we pray thee, that these our oblations may deliver
      us from every bond of iniquity, and obtain for us the bounteous
      gifts of thy mercy. Through.</P>
