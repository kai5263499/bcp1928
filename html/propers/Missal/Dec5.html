      <B>INTROIT. <I>Os justi. Ps. </I>37.</B><BR />
      THE mouth of the righteous is exercised in wisdom, and his tongue
      will be talking of judgement: the law of his God is in heart
      heart (alleluia, alleluia). <I>Ps. ibid. </I>Fret not thyself
      because of the ungodly: neither be thou envious against the evildoers.
      V. Glory be.</P>

      <P><B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      GRANT, we beseech thee, O Lord, that the prayers of thy holy
      Abbot, blessed Sabas may commend us unto thee: that we, who have
      no power of ourselves to help ourselves, may by his advocacy
      find favour in thy sight. [Through]</P>

      <P><B>COLLECT 2, <I>as in some Uses.<BR />
      </I></B>O GOD, who to the blessed Abbot Sabas<I> </I>gavest grace
      to imitate Christ in his poverty, and with humble heart to follow
      him to the end: grant that all who enter the path of Gospel perfection
      may neither look back nor go astray from the way, but hastening
      to thee without stumbling, may attain the crown of eternal life
      whereunto thou dost call them. Through the same.</P>

      <B>The Epistle. <FONT COLOR="#000000">Ecclesiasticus 45:1b-5a</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1. He was loved of God and men, whose memorial is blessed.<BR />
      2 The Lord made him like to the glorious Saints, and magnified
      him, so that his enemies stood in fear of him.<BR />
      3 By his words he caused the wonders to cease: he made him glorious
      in the sight of kings, and gave him a commandment for his people,
      and shewed him his glory.<BR />
      4 He sanctified him in his faithfulness and meekness, and chose
      him out of all men.<BR />
      5 He made him to hear his voice, and brought him into the dark
      cloud, and gave him commandments before his face, even the law
      of life and knowledge.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">GRADUAL. <I>Ps. </I>21.</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"> Thou hast prevented him with the blessings
      of goodness: and hast set a crown of pure gold upon his head.
      He asked life of thee, and thou gavest him a long life: even
      for ever and ever.<BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>Ps. </I>92. The righteous shall flourish
      like a palm-tree: and shall spread abroad like a cedar in Libanus.
      Alleluia.</FONT></P>

      <P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">After Septuagesima, instead of the

      endureth for ever.</FONT></P>

      <P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">In Eastertide, instead of the Gradual,
      is said:</FONT></I></P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Alleluia. Alleluia. V. 92. The righteous
      shall flourish like a palm-tree: and shall spread abroad like

      <P><B>GOSPEL. St Matthew 19:27-29</B><BR />
      27 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken
      all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?<BR />
      28 And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which
      have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall
      sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve
      thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.<BR />
      29 And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters,
      or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my
      name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit
      everlasting life.</P>

      <P><B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps. </I>21. </B>Thou hast given him his heart's
      desire, and hast not denied him the request of his lips: thou
      hast set a crown of pure gold upon his head (alleluia).</P>

      <P><B>SECRET</B>.<BR />
      WE beseech thee, O Lord, that thy holy Abbot Sabas may intercede
      for us: that this sacrifice which we offer and present upon thy
      holy altar may be profitable unto us for our salvation. Through.</P>

      <P><B>COMMUNION. <I>St. Luke &nbsp;</I>12. </B>A faithful and
      wise steward, whom his Lord hath made ruler over his household:
      to give them their portion of meat in due season (alleluia).</P>

      <P><B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      O LORD, We pray thee that this holy Sacrament which we have now
      received and the prayers of thy holy Abbot, blessed Sabas may
      effectually defend us: that we may both imitate the example of
      his conversation, and perceive the succour of his intercession.
      Through.</P>
