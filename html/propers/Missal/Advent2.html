      <B>INTROIT. <I>Populus Sion. Isa. </I>30<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B> O PEOPLE of Sion, behold,
      the Lord is nigh at hand to redeem the nations: and in the gladness
      of your heart the Lord shall cause his glorious voice to be heard.
      <I>Ps. 80. </I>Hear, O thou Shepherd of Israel: thou that leadest
      Joseph like a sheep. V. Glory be. <BR />
<BR />
<BR />
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      BLESSED Lord, who hast caused all holy Scriptures to be written
      for our learning: Grant that we may in such wise hear them, read,
      mark, learn, and inwardly digest them, that by patience and comfort
      of thy holy Word, we may embrace, and ever hold fast, the blessed
      hope of everlasting life, which thou has given us in our Saviour
      Jesus Christ. AMEN</P>

      <P>COLLECT 2 <I>of Advent; </I>3 <I>of St Mary.<BR />
<BR />
      </I><B>EPISTLE. <I>Romans </I>15:4-13</B><BR />
      4 BRETHREN: whatsoever things were written aforetime were written
      for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the
      scriptures might have hope. <BR />
      5 Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded
      one toward another according to Christ Jesus: <BR />
      6 That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the
      Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. <BR />
      7 Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us
      to the glory of God. <BR />
      8 Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision
      for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:
<BR />
      9 And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it
      is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles,
      and sing unto thy name. <BR />
      10 And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.
<BR />
      11 And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him,
      all ye people. <BR />
      12 And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and
      he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the
      Gentiles trust. <BR />
      13 Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing,
      that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.
<BR />
<BR />
      <B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps. </I>50<I>. </I></B>Out of Sion hath God appeared:
      in perfect beauty. V. Gather my saints together unto me: those
      that have made a covenant with me with sacrifice. <BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V.<I> Ps. 122 </I>I was glad when they said
      unto me: we will go into the house of the Lord. Alleluia. <BR />
<BR />
<BR />
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>St. Luke </I>21:25-33<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B> 25 AT that time; Jesus
      said unto his disciples: And there shall be signs in the sun,
      and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress
      of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; <BR />
      26 Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after
      those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of
      heaven shall be shaken. <BR />
      27 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with
      power and great glory. <BR />
      28 And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up,
      and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh. <BR />
      29 And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all
      the trees; <BR />
      30 When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves
      that summer is now nigh at hand. <BR />
      31 So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know
      ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand. <BR />
      32 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away,
      till all be fulfilled. <BR />
      33 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass
      away. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps. </I>85<I>.</I></B><I> </I>Wilt thou not
      turn again, O God, and quicken us, that thy people may rejoice
      in thee: shew us thy mercy, O Lord, and grant us thy salvation.
<BR />
<BR />
      <B>SECRET.</B><BR />
      WE BESEECH thee, O Lord, mercifully to accept the prayers and
      oblations of us thy humble servants: that we, who can do nothing
      of ourselves to help ourselves, may be defended by the succour
      of thy grace. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>COMMUNION. <I>Baruch 4 and 5 </I></B>Arise, O Jerusalem, and
      stand on high, and behold the joy that cometh unto thee from
      thy God. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      O LORD, who hast vouchsafed to satisfy us with heavenly sustenance:
      we humbly beseech thee; that we, who thou hast made partakers
      of thy holy mysteries, may learn therein to despise all things
      earthly, and to cleave stedfastly unto all things heavenly. [Through]</P>
