      INTROIT. <I>Sederunt principes. Ps.</I> 119.<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>Princes, moreover, did
      sit, and did witness falsely against me; and the ungodly pressed
      sore upon me; O Lord, my God, stand up to help me, for thy servant
      is occupied continually in thy commandments. <I>Ps. ibid.</I>
      Blessed are those that are undefiled in the way: and walk in
      the law of the Lord. V. Glory be.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      Grant, O Lord, that, in all our sufferings here upon earth for
      the testimony of thy truth, we may stedfastly look up to heaven,
      and by faith behold the glory that shall be revealed; and being
      filled with the Holy Ghost may learn to love and bless our persecutors
      by the example of thy first Martyr Saint Stephen; who prayed
      for his murderers to thee, O blessed Jesus, who standest at the
      right hand of God to succour all those that suffer for thee,
      our only Mediator and Advocate. <I>AMEN.</I></P>

      <P><I>Then shall follow the Collect of the Nativity, which shall
      be said continually unto New Year's Eve<BR />
<BR />
      </I><B>EPISTLE. <I>Acts </I>7:55-60<BR />
      </B>55 IN those days: Stephen, being full of the Holy Ghost,
      looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and
      Jesus standing on the right hand of God, <BR />
      56 And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of
      man standing on the right hand of God. <BR />
      57 Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears,
      and ran upon him with one accord, <BR />
      58 And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses
      laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was
      Saul. <BR />
      59 And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord
      Jesus, receive my spirit. <BR />
      60 And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay
      not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell
      asleep. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps.</I> 119. </B>Princes also did sit and speak
      against me: and wicked men have persecuted me. V. Help me, O
      Lord my God: save me for thy mercy's sake,<BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>Acts 7. </I>I see the heavens opened,
      and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. Alleluia.</P>

      <P><I>&para; In Votive Masses after Septuagesima, instead of
      the </I>Alleluia<I> and verse following, is said the Tract from
      the Common of a Martyr. But in Eastertide, the Gradual is omitted,
      and in its place is said the </I>Alleluia <I>as above, and then
      the verse: </I>Thou hast set a crown of pure gold upon his head,
      O Lord. Alleluia<BR />
<BR />
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>St. Matthew </I>23:34-39<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>34 BEHOLD, I send unto
      you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye
      shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in
      your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city: <BR />
      35 That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the
      earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias
      son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.
<BR />
      36 Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this
      generation. <BR />
      37 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and
      stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have
      gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens
      under her wings, and ye would not! <BR />
      38 Behold, your house is left unto you desolate. <BR />
      39 For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye
      shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
      <I>The Creed is said on account of the Octave.<BR />
<BR />
      </I><B>OFFERTORY.</B> <B><I>Acts 6 &amp; 7. </I></B>The Apostles
      chose Stephen the Levite, a man full of faith and of the Holy
      ghost: whom the Jews had stoned calling upon God and saying:
      Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>SECRET.</B><BR />
      Accept, O Lord, we pray thee, the gifts which we offer unto thee
      in remembrance of thy Saints: that like as they by suffering
      obtained thy crown of glory, so we by godly conversation may
      attain to innocence of life. Through.</P>

      <P><I>Of the Nativity. </I><B>SECRET.<BR />
      </B>WE beseech thee, O Lord, that by this new Birth of thy only-begotten
      Son thou wouldest vouchsafe to sanctify these our oblations:
      and to cleanse us from the defilements of all our iniquities.
      Through the same.</P>

      <P><B>PREFACE</B> <I>and</I> <B>CANON</B> <I>of Christmas.<BR />
<BR />
      </I><B>COMMUNION. <I>Acts 7.</I></B><I> </I>I see the heavens
      opened and Jesus standing at the right hand of the power of God:
      Lord Jesus, receive my spirit, and lay not this sin to their
      charge, for they know not what they do.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      Assist us mercifully, O Lord: that we, which have received these
      holy mysteries; may, at the intercession of thy blessed Martyr
      Saint Stephen, be stablished by thy everlasting protection. Through.</P>

      <P><I>Of the Nativity. </I><B>POSTCOMMUNION.<BR />
      </B>GRANT, we beseech thee, Almighty God: that like as thy Son,
      born this day the Saviour of the world, hath been made the author
      of our heavenly birth; so he may bestow upon us the gift of everlasting
      life. Who liveth and reigneth with thee.</P>

      <P>&para; <I>Within the Octave of St. Stephen, nothing is said
      of that Feast.</I></P>
