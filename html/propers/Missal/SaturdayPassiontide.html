      </FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#000000">18 Then said they, Come, and
      let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not
      perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word
      from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue,
      and let us not give heed to any of his words.<BR>
      19 Give heed to me, O LORD, and hearken to the voice of them
      that contend with me.<BR>
      20 Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a
      pit for my soul. Remember that I stood before thee to speak good
      for them, and to turn away thy wrath from them.<BR>
      21 Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour
      out their blood by the force of the sword; and let their wives
      be bereaved of their children, and be widows; and let their men
      be put to death; let their young men be slain by the sword in
      battle.<BR>
      22 Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring
      a troop suddenly upon them: for they have digged a pit to take
      me, and hid snares for my feet.<BR>
      23 Yet, LORD, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay
      me: forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from
      thy sight, but let them be overthrown before thee; deal thus
      with them in the time of thine anger, O Lord our God.</FONT></P>

      <I>Ps. 35. </I>Their communing is not for peace: but they imagine
      deceitful words against them that are quiet in the land. V. This
      hast thou seen, O Lord, hold not thy tongue ; go not far from
      me, O Lord.</FONT></P>

      At that time: the chief priests consulted that they might put
      Lazarus also to death;<BR>
      11 Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away,
      and believed on Jesus.<BR>
      12 On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when
      they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,<BR>
      13 Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and
      cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in
      the name of the Lord.<BR>
      14 And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as
      it is written,<BR>
      15 Fear not, daughter of Zion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting
      on an ass's colt.<BR>
      16 These things understood not his disciples at the first: but
      when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things
      were written of him, and that they had done these things unto
      him.<BR>
      17 The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus
      out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.<BR>
      18 For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard
      that he had done this miracle.<BR>
      19 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye
      how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.<BR>
      20 And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship
      at the feast:<BR>
      21 The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida
      of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.<BR>
      22 Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip
      tell Jesus.<BR>
      23 And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the
      Son of man should be glorified.<BR>
      24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall
      into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it
      bringeth forth much fruit.<BR>
      25 He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth
      his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.<BR>
      26 If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there
      shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father
      honour.<BR>
      27 Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save
      me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.<BR>
      28 Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven,
      saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.<BR>
      29 The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that
      it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.<BR>
      30 Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me,
      but for your sakes.<BR>
      31 Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of
      this world be cast out.<BR>
      32 And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men
      unto me.<BR>
      33 This he said, signifying what death he should die.<BR>
      34 The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that
      Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man
      must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?<BR>
      35 Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light
      with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon
      you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.<BR>
      36 While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be
      the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed,
      and did hide himself from them.</FONT></P>
