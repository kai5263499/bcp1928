      </FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#000000">11 In those days: Azarias prayed
      unto the Lord, saying: O Lord, Yet deliver us not up wholly,
      for thy name's sake, neither disannul thou thy covenant:<BR>
      12 And cause not thy mercy to depart from us, for thy beloved
      Abraham's sake, for thy servant Issac's sake, and for thy holy
      Israel's sake;<BR>
      13 To whom thou hast spoken and promised, that thou wouldest
      multiply their seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that
      lieth upon the seashore.<BR>
      14 For we, O Lord, are become less than any nation, and be kept
      under this day in all the world because of our sins.<BR>
      15 Neither is there at this time prince, or prophet, or leader,
      or burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, or
      place to sacrifice before thee, and to find mercy.<BR>
      16 Nevertheless in a contrite heart and an humble spirit let
      us be accepted.<BR>
      17 Like as in the burnt offerings of rams and bullocks, and like
      as in ten thousands of fat lambs: so let our sacrifice be in
      thy sight this day, and grant that we may wholly go after thee:
      for they shall not be confounded that put their trust in thee.<BR>
      18 And now we follow thee with all our heart, we fear thee, and
      seek thy face.<BR>
      19 Put us not to shame: but deal with us after thy lovingkindness,
      and according to the multitude of thy mercies.<BR>
      20 Deliver us also according to thy marvellous works, and give
      glory to thy name, O Lord: and let all them that do thy servants
      hurt be ashamed;<BR>
      21 And let them be confounded in all their power and might, and
      let their strength be broken;<BR>
      22 And let them know that thou art God, the only God, and glorious
      over the whole world, O Lord our God.</FONT></P>

      he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house,
      and sat down to meat.<BR>
      37 And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when
      she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought
      an alabaster box of ointment,<BR>
      38 And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash
      his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her
      head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.<BR>
      39 Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake
      within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would
      have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth
      him: for she is a sinner.<BR>
      40 And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat
      to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.<BR>
      41 There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one
      owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.<BR>
      42 And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them
      both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?<BR>
      43 Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave
      most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.<BR>
      44 And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou
      this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water
      for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped
      them with the hairs of her head.<BR>
      45 Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came
      in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.<BR>
      46 My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath
      anointed my feet with ointment.<BR>
      47 Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven;
      for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same
      loveth little.<BR>
      48 And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.<BR>
      49 And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves,
      Who is this that forgiveth sins also?<BR>
      50 And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in
      peace.</FONT></P>
