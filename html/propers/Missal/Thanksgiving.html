      HE fed them also with the finest wheat flour: and with honey
      from the rock hath he satisfied them. <I>Ps. ibid. </I>Sing we
      merrily unto God our strength: make a cheerful noise unto the
      God of Jacob. V. Glory be.</P>

      O MOST merciful Father, who hast blessed the labours of the husbandman
      in the returns of the fruits of the earth; We give thee humble
      and hearty thanks for this thy bounty; beseeching thee to continue
      thy loving-kindness to us, that our land may still yield her
      increase, to thy glory and our comfort; through Jesus Christ
      our Lord. Amen.</P>

      <B>EPISTLE. <I>James </I>1:16-<FONT COLOR="#000000">27</FONT></B><BR>
      16 Do not err, my beloved brethren. <BR>
      17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and
      cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness,
      neither shadow of turning. <BR>
      18 Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we
      should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. <BR>
      19 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to
      hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath: <BR>
      20 For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.
<BR>
      21 Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness,
      and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to
      save your souls. <BR>
      22 But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving
      your own selves. <BR>
      23 For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is
      like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass: <BR>
      24 For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway
      forgetteth what manner of man he was. <BR>
      25 But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth
      therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work,
      this man shall be blessed in his deed. <BR>
      26 If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not
      his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion
      is vain. <BR>
      27 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this,
      To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to
      keep himself unspotted from the world.</P>

      <P><B>GRADUAL</B>. <I>Ps. </I>145. The eyes of all wait upon
      thee, O Lord: and thou givest them their meat in due season.
      V. Thou openest think hand: and fillest all things living with
      plenteousness. <BR>
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>Ps. </I>147. O praise the Lord, for
      it is a good thing to sing praises unto our God; yea, a joyful
      and pleasant thing it is to be thankful, alleluia.</P>

      <P><B>GOSPEL.<I> St Matthew</I> 6:25-34<BR>
      </B><FONT COLOR="#000000">25 AT that time: Jesus said; Take no
      thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink;
      nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life
      more than meat, and the body than raiment? <BR>
      26 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do
      they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth
      them. Are ye not much better than they? <BR>
      27 Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his
      stature? <BR>
      28 And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of
      the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:
<BR>
      29 And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory
      was not arrayed like one of these. <BR>
      30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which
      today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much
      more clothe you, O ye of little faith? <BR>
      31 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or,
      What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? <BR>
      32 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your
      heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.
<BR>
      33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness;
      and all these things shall be added unto you. <BR>
      34 Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall
      take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day
      is the evil thereof.</FONT></P>
