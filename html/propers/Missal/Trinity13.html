      </i>INTROIT. </b><i>Respice, Domine. Ps. </i>74.<br />
      LOOK, O Lord, upon the covenant,
      and forget not the congregation of the poor for ever: arise,
      O God, maintain thine own cause, and be not unmindful of the
      voices of them that seek thee. <i>Ps. ibid.</i> O God, wherefore
      art thou absent from us so long: why is thy wrath so hot against
      the sheep in thy pasture? V. Glory be.<br />
        <br />
        <b>COLLECT.</b><br />
      ALMIGHTY and merciful God, of whose only gift it cometh that
      thy faithful people do unto thee true and laudable service: grant,
      we beseech thee, that we may so faithfully serve thee in this
      life, that we fail not finally to attain thy heavenly promises.
      Through the merits of Jesus Christ our Lord. [Who.]<br />
        <b><br />
          EPISTLE.<i> Galatians 3:16-22<br />
  </i></b>16 BRETHREN: to Abraham and his seed were the promises
      made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one,
      And to thy seed, which is Christ.<br />
      17 And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before
      of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty
      years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise
      of none effect.<br />
      18 For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise:
      but God gave it to Abraham by promise.<br />
      19 Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions,
      till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it
      was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.<br />
      20 Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.<br />
      21 Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for
      if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily
      righteousness should have been by the law.<br />
      22 But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise
      by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.<br />
        <br />
        <b>GRADUAL. </b><i>Ps. </i>74. Look upon the covenant, O Lord,
      and forget not the congregation of the poor for ever. V. Arise,
      O God, maintain thine own cause; remember how the foolish man
      blasphemeth thee daily.<br />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <i>Ps. </i>90 Lord, thou hast been our
      refuge: from one generation to another. Alleluia.<br />
        <br />
        <b>GOSPEL. <i>St. Luke 10:23-37<br />
        </i></b>23 AT that time, Jesus said
      to His disciples: Blessed are the eyes which see the things that
      ye see:<br />
      24 For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired
      to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and
      to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.<br />
      25 And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying,
      Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?<br />
      26 He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest
      thou?<br />
      27 And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
      all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength,
      and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.<br />
      28 And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and
      thou shalt live.<br />
      29 But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who
      is my neighbour?<br />
      30 And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem
      to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his
      raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.<br />
      31 And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and
      when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.<br />
      32 And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and
      looked on him, and passed by on the other side.<br />
      33 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was:
      and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,<br />
      34 And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and
      wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn,
      and took care of him.<br />
      35 And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence,
      and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him;
      and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will
      repay thee.<br />
      36 Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto
      him that fell among the thieves?<br />
      37 And he said, He that showed mercy on him. Then said Jesus
      unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.<br />
        <br />
        <b>OFFERTORY. </b><i>Ps. </i>31. My hope hath been in thee, O
      Lord; I have said: thou art my God, my time is in thy hand.<br />
        <br />
        <b>SECRET.</b><br />
      WE beseech thee, O Lord, mercifully to look upon the oblation,
      which on thine holy altar we do present unto thee: that the same
      may be profitable unto us for the obtaining of thy pardon, and
      effectually avail for the increasing of the glory of thy Name.
