      INTROIT. <I>Adorate Deum. Ps. </I>97.<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>All ye Angels of God,
      fall down, and worship before him: Sion heard of it, and rejoiced,
      and the daughters of Judah were glad. Ps. <I>ibid. </I>The Lord
      is King, the earth may be glad thereof: yea, the multitude of
      the isles may be glad thereof. V. Glory be.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>COLLECT</B>.<BR />
      O God, whose blessed Son was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil, and make us the sons of God, and heirs of eternal life; Grant us, we beseech thee, that having this hope, we may purify ourselves, even as he is pure; that, when he shall appear again with power and great glory, we may be made like unto him in his eternal and glorious kingdom; where with thee, O Father, and thee, O Holy Ghost, he liveth and reigneth ever, one God, world without end.  AMEN<BR />
<BR />
      <B>EPISTLE. <I>I. St. John </I>3:1-8.</B><BR />
      1 Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us,
      that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world
      knoweth us not, because it knew him not. <BR />
      2 Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear
      what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we
      shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. <BR />
      3 And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself,
      even as he is pure. <BR />
      4 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin
      is the transgression of the law. <BR />
      5 And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and
      in him is no sin. <BR />
      6 Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath
      not seen him, neither known him. <BR />
      7 Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness
      is righteous, even as he is righteous. <BR />
      8 He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth
      from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested,
      that he might destroy the works of the devil. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>GRADUAL</B>. <B><I>Ps</I>. 102. </B>The heathen shall fear
      thy Name, O Lord: and all the kings of the earth thy majesty.
      V. When the Lord shall build up Sion: and when his glory shall
      appear.<BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. Ps. 97. The Lord is King, the earth may
      be glad thereof: yea, the multitude of the isles may be glad
      thereof. Alleluia.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>St. Matthew </I>24:23-31<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>23 AT that time; Jesus
      said unto his disciples: Then if any man shall say unto you,
      Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. <BR />
      24 For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and
      shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were
      possible, they shall deceive the very elect. <BR />
      25 Behold, I have told you before. <BR />
      26 Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the
      desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe
      it not. <BR />
      27 For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even
      unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
<BR />
      28 For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered
      together. <BR />
      29 Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the
      sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the
      stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall
      be shaken: <BR />
      30 And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven:
      and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall
      see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power
      and great glory. <BR />
      31 And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet,
      and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds,
      from one end of heaven to the other. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps</I>. 118. </B>The right hand of the Lord
      hath the pre-eminence, the right hand of the Lord bringeth mighty
      things to pass: I shall not die, but live, and declare the works
      of the Lord.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>SECRET.<BR />
      </B>Grant, O Lord, we pray thee, that this oblation may evermore
      cleanse and regenerate, govern and defend us. Through.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>COMMUNION</B>. <B><I>St. Luke </I>4.</B> All wondered at the
      gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION</B>.<BR />
      O Lord, who hast fulfilled us with thy heavenly delights: grant,
      we beseech thee; that we may ever earnestly seek after those
      things whereby we truly live. Through.</P>
