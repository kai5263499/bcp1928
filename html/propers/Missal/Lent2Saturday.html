      </I><B>LESSON. <I>Genesis </I>27:6-39</B><BR>
      6 IN those days: Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold,
      I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying, <BR>
      7 Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat,
      and bless thee before the LORD before my death. <BR>
      8 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which
      I command thee. <BR>
      9 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids
      of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father,
      such as he loveth: <BR>
      10 And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and
      that he may bless thee before his death. <BR>
      11 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother
      is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man: <BR>
      12 My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him
      as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.
<BR>
      13 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son:
      only obey my voice, and go fetch me them. <BR>
      14 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother:
      and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved. <BR>
      15 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which
      were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger
      son: <BR>
      16 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands,
      and upon the smooth of his neck: <BR>
      17 And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had
      prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob. <BR>
      18 And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said,
      Here am I; who art thou, my son? <BR>
      19 And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy firstborn; I
      have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit
      and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me. <BR>
      20 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found
      it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God
      brought it to me. <BR>
      21 And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I
      may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.
<BR>
      22 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him,
      and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands
      of Esau. <BR>
      23 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as
      his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him. <BR>
      24 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.
<BR>
      25 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's
      venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near
      to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank.
<BR>
      26 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss
      me, my son. <BR>
      27 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell
      of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of
      my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:
<BR>
      28 Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness
      of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine: <BR>
      29 Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord
      over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee:
      cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that
      blesseth thee. <BR>
      30 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing
      Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of
      Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
<BR>
      31 And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his
      father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat
      of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me. <BR>
      32 And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said,
      I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau. <BR>
      33 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where
      is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have
      eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and
      he shall be blessed. <BR>
      34 And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with
      a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless
      me, even me also, O my father. <BR>
      35 And he said, Thy brother came with subtlety, and hath taken
      away thy blessing. <BR>
      36 And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted
      me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold,
      now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not
      reserved a blessing for me? <BR>
      37 And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made
      him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants;
      and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I
      do now unto thee, my son? <BR>
      38 And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing,
      my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted
      up his voice, and wept. <BR>
      39 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy
      dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of
      heaven from above.</P>

      <P><B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps</I>. 92.</B> It is a good thing to give
      thanks unto the Lord: and to sing praises unto thy Name, O Most
      Highest. V. To tell of thy loving kindness early in the morning,
      and of thy truth in the night-season.</P>

      <B>GOSPEL. <I>St. Luke </I>15:11-32<BR>
      <FONT SIZE="-1"><IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></FONT></B>11
      AT that time Jesus spake this parable unto the scribes and Pharisees:
      A certain man had two sons: <BR>
      12 And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me
      the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto
      them his living. <BR>
      13 And not many days after the younger son gathered all together,
      and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his
      substance with riotous living. <BR>
      14 And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in
      that land; and he began to be in want. <BR>
      15 And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country;
      and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. <BR>
      16 And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that
      the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him. <BR>
      17 And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants
      of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with
      hunger! <BR>
      18 I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father,
      I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, <BR>
      19 And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one
      of thy hired servants. <BR>
      20 And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet
      a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and
      ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. <BR>
      21 And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven,
      and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.
<BR>
      22 But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best
      robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes
      on his feet: <BR>
      23 And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us
      eat, and be merry: <BR>
      24 For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost,
      and is found. And they began to be merry. <BR>
      25 Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew
      nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing. <BR>
      26 And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things
      meant. <BR>
      27 And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father
      hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe
      and sound. <BR>
      28 And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his
      father out, and entreated him. <BR>
      29 And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years
      do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment:
      and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with
      my friends: <BR>
      30 But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured
      thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted
      calf. <BR>
      31 And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all
      that I have is thine. <BR>
      32 It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this
      thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is
      found.</P>

      <P><B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps</I>. 13.</B> Lighten mine eyes that I
      sleep not in death: lest mine enemy say: I have prevailed against
      him.</P>

      <P><B>SECRET.</B><BR>
      We beseech thee, O Lord, mercifully to look upon these our oblations:
      and grant that like as we do pray to be delivered from the sins
      which we have committed, so we may be preserved from all the
      devices of our enemies. Through.</P>

      <P><B>COMMUNION. <I>St. Luke</I> 15.</B> It is meet that we should
      be glad, my son, for thy brother was dead and is alive again
      : and was lost and is found.</P>

      <P><B>POSTCOMMUNION</B>.<BR>
      O Lord, who in this holy Sacrament hast refreshed us with heavenly
      food : grant that the same may in such wise be inwardly bestowed
      upon our hearts, that we may in very truth be made partakers
      of the same. Through.</P>

      <P><B>COLLECT.</B><BR>
      O Lord, we beseech thee to keep thy Church and household continually
      in thy true religion that they who do lean only upon the hope
      of thy heavenly grace, may evermore be defended by thy heavenly
      protection. Through.<BR>
