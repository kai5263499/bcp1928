      </B>O God, who on thy blessed Confessor Saint Titus didst bestow
      the virtues of thine Apostles: grant, we beseech thee, that by
      his merits and intercession; we may so live righteously and soberly
      in this world, that we may be found worthy to attain unto our
      country in heaven. Through.</P>

      <P><BR />
      <B>For the Epistle. <FONT COLOR="#000000">Ecclesiasticus 44:16</FONT></B><BR />
      Behold a great priest who in his days pleased the Lord and was
      found righteous: and in the time of wrath he was taken in exchange
      for the world. There was none like unto him to keep the law of
      the Most High. Therefore by an oath the Lord assured him that
      he would increase him among his people. He established with him
      the blessing of all men and the covenant, and made it rest upon
      his head. He acknowledged him in his blessing: and preserved
      for him his mercy: so that he found favour in the sight of the
      Lord. He magnified him in the sight of kings: and gave unto him
      a crown of glory. An everlasting covenant he made with him and
      gave him a great priesthood and blessed him with glory, that
      he should execute the office of the priesthood and have honour
      in his name and offer unto him incense and a sweet savour.</P>

      <P><B>GRADUAL. <I>Ecclus. </I>44.</B> Behold a great priest who
      in his days pleased the Lord. V. There was none like unto him
      to keep the law of the Most High.<BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>Ps. </I>110. Thou art a priest for
      ever after the order of Melchisedech. Alleluia.</P>

      <P><I>After Septuagesima, instead of the Alleluia and verse following,
      is said:</I></P>

      <P><B>TRACT. <I>Ps. </I>112. </B>Blessed is the man that feareth
      the Lord: he hath great delight in his commandments. V. His seed
      shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the faithful shall
      be blessed. V. Riches and plenteousness shall be in his house:
      and his righteousness endureth for ever.</P>

      <P><I>In Eastertide, instead of the Gradual, is said:</I></P>

      <P>Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>Ps. </I>110. Thou art a priest for
      ever after the order of Melchisedech. Alleluia. V. This is a
      priest whom the Lord hath crowned. Alleluia.</P>

      <P><B>The Gospel. St Luke 10:1-9</B><BR />
      1 After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and
      sent them two and two before his face into every city and place,
      whither he himself would come.<BR />
      2 Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but
      the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest,
      that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.<BR />
      3 Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.<BR />
      4 Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man
      by the way.<BR />
      5 And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to
      this house.<BR />
      6 And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon
      it: if not, it shall turn to you again.<BR />
      7 And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things
      as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not
      from house to house.<BR />
      8 And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat
      such things as are set before you:<BR />
      9 And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The
      kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.</P>
