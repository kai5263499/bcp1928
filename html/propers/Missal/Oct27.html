      </B>O LET the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before

      be openly shewed upon the heathen. <I>Ps. ibid. </I>O God, the

      WE beseech thee, Almighty God, to have respect unto thy people
      who this day prevent the heavenly birthday of thy glorious Apostles
      Simon and Jude: that as they continually stand before thy Majesty
      as our intercessors; so we may the more worthily receive thy
      bounties. Through.</P>

      <B>The Epistle. <FONT COLOR="#000000">1 Corinthians 4:9b-14</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      9 We are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and
      to men.<BR />
      10 We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ;
      we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are
      despised.<BR />
      11 Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and
      are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;<BR />
      12 And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we
      bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:<BR />
      13 Being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the
      world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day.<BR />
      14 I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons
      I warn you.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">GRADUAL. <I>Ps. </I>79. </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000">O let the vengeance of thy servants' blood that
      is shed be openly shewed. V. The dead bodies of thy servants,
      O Lord, have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the air:
      and the flesh of thy Saints unto the beasts of the land.</FONT></P>

      <P><B>The Gospel. St John 15:1-7<BR />
      </B><FONT COLOR="#000000">1 AT that time: Jesus said unto his
      disciples: I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.<BR />
      2 Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and
      every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring
      forth more fruit.<BR />
      3 Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto
      you.<BR />
      4 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit
      of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except
      ye abide in me.<BR />
      5 I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me,
      and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without
      me ye can do nothing.<BR />
      6 If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and
      is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire,
      and they are burned.<BR />
      7 If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask
      what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">OFFERTORY. <I>Ps. </I>149. </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Let the Saints be joyful with glory, let them
      rejoice in their beds: let the praises of God be in their mouth.</FONT></P>

      in thy sight. Through.</FONT></P>
