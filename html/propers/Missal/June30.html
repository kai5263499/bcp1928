      O GOD, who through the preaching of thy blessed Apostle Saint
      Paul hast caused the light of the Gospel to shine forth upon
      the Gentiles: grant, we beseech thee; that we, who this day call
      him to remembrance, may feel the effectual succour of his intercession.
      Through.</P>

      <B>The Epistle. <FONT COLOR="#000000">Galatians 1:11-20</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      11 I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached
      of me is not after man.<BR />
      12 For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it,
      but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.<BR />
      13 For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews'
      religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of
      God, and wasted it:<BR />
      14 And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in
      mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions
      of my fathers.<BR />
      15 But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's
      womb, and called me by his grace,<BR />
      16 To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the
      heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:<BR />
      17 Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles
      before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.<BR />
      18 Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter,
      and abode with him fifteen days.<BR />
      19 But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's
      brother.<BR />
      20 Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God,
      I lie not.<BR />

      <P><B>The Gospel. St Matthew 10:16-2</B><BR />
      16 Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves:
      be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.<BR />
      17 But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils,
      and they will scourge you in their synagogues;<BR />
      18 And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my
      sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.<BR />
      19 But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what
      ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what
      ye shall speak.<BR />
      20 For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father
      which speaketh in you.<BR />
      21 And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and
      the father the child: and the children shall rise up against
      their parents, and cause them to be put to death.<BR />
      22 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he
      that endureth to the end shall be saved.</P>
