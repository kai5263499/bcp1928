      INTROIT. <I>Misereris amnium. Wisdom </I>II<I>.<BR />
      </I><IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>THOU hast mercy upon all,
      O Lord, and abhorrest nothing which thou hast made, and winkest
      at the sins of men, because they should amend, and sparest them:
      for thou art the Lord our God. Ps. 57. Be merciful unto me, O
      God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee. V. Glory
      be.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>COLLECT</B>.<BR />
      Almighty and everlasting God, who hatest nothing that thou hast
      made, and dost forgive the sins of all those who are penitent:
      create and make in us new and contrite hearts, that we worthily
      lamenting our sins and acknowledging our wretchedness, may obtain
      of thee, the God of all mercy, perfect remission and forgiveness.
      [Through.] <BR />
<BR />
<BR />
      <B>FOR EPISTLE. <I>Joel </I>2:12-17</B><BR />
      12 TURN ye even to me with all your heart, and with fasting,
      and with weeping, and with mourning: <BR />
      13 And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto
      the LORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger,
      and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil. <BR />
      14 Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing
      behind him; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the
      LORD your God? <BR />
      15 Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly:
<BR />
      16 Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the
      elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts:
      let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out
      of her closet. <BR />
      17 Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the
      porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O LORD,
      and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should
      rule over them: wherefore should they say among the people, Where
      is their God? <BR />
<BR />
      <B>GRADUAL</B>.<B> <I>Ps</I>. 57. </B>Be merciful unto me, O
      God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee. V. He
      shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproof of him that
      would eat me up.<BR />
<BR />
      <I>&para; And this Tract is said on Mondays, Wednesdays, and
      Fridays, from today on until Monday in Holy Week, unless a proper
      Tract be appointed.<BR />
<BR />
      </I><B>TRACT. <I>Ps</I>. 103. </B>O Lord, deal not with us after
      our sins; nor reward us according to wickednesses. V. Ps. 79.
      Lord, remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and
      that soon: for we are come to great misery. V. <I>(Here genuflect.)</I>
      Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name, O
      Lord: O deliver us and be merciful unto our sins, for thy Name's
      sake.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>St. Matthew </I>6:16-21<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>16 AT that time; Jesus
      said unto his disciples: when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites,
      of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they
      may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have
      their reward. <BR />
      17 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy
      face; <BR />
      18 That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father
      which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall
      reward thee openly. <BR />
      19 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth
      and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:
<BR />
      20 But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither
      moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through
      nor steal: <BR />
      21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
<BR />
<BR />
      <B>OFFERTORY</B>.<B><I> Ps. </I>30. </B>I will magnify thee,
      O Lord, for thou hast set me up, and not made my foes to triumph
      over me: O Lord, my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed
      me.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>SECRET</B><I>.<BR />
      </I>Grant, we beseech thee, O Lord, that like as we do by these
      our oblations bring to remembrance the institution of this holy
      Sacrament, so we may by thee be enabled to offer the same according
      to thy will. Through.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>COMMUNION. <I>Ps</I>. 1. </B>He who doth meditate on the law
      of the Lord day and night will bring forth his fruit in due season.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION</B>.<BR />
      We beseech thee, Lord, mercifully to protect us who have now
      received this holy Sacrament: that this our fast may be acceptable
      in thy sight, and profitable unto us for the healing of our souls.
      through.<BR />
<BR />
      <I>&para; Then the Priest without any other Salutation to the
      People, shall say: </I>Let us pray. <I>And the Deacon, if any
      be ministering in the office of Deacon, shall turn about to the
      People with hands joined and say, </I>Bow down before the Lord.
      <I>Else shall the Priest himself say thus, standing in the same
      place afore the book and not turning about to the people.<BR />
<BR />
      </I><B>COLLECT</B>.<BR />
      Look down in mercy, O Lord, upon us now kneeling before thy majesty:
      that we which have been partakers of thy heavenly gifts may evermore
      be strengthened with thy heavenly succour. Through.<BR />
<BR />
      <I>&para; And this manner of saying the Prayer over the People
      is to be observed, in ferial Masses only, until the Wednesday
      in Holy Week.<BR />
      </I><BR />
      Afterwards.<BR />
      V. Let us bless the Lord.<BR />
      <I>R. </I>Thanks be to God.<BR />
