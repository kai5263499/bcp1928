      </B>Right dear are thy friends unto me, O God, and held in highest
      honour: their rule and governance is exceeding stedfast. <I>Ps.
      ibid. </I>O Lord, thou hast searched me out and known me: thou
      knowest my downsitting and mine uprising.V. Glory be.</P>

      <P><B>COLLECT.<BR />
      </B>ALMIGHTY and everliving God, who for the greater confirmation
      of the faith didst suffer thy holy Apostle Thomas to be doubtful
      in thy Son's resurrection: grant us so perfectly, and without
      all doubt, to believe in thy Son Jesus Christ; that our faith
      in thy sight may never be reproved. Hear us, O Lord, through
      the same Jesus Christ, to whom, with thee, and the Holy Ghost,
      be all honour and glory, now and for evermore. Amen.</P>

      35 Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great
      recompence of reward. <BR />
      36 For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the
      will of God, ye might receive the promise. <BR />
      37 For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come,
      and will not tarry. <BR />
      38 Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back,
      my soul shall have no pleasure in him. <BR />
      39 But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of
      them that believe to the saving of the soul. <BR />
      1 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence
      of things not seen.</FONT></P>

      <P><B>GOSPEL. <I>St John</I> 20:24-31<BR />
      </B><FONT COLOR="#000000">24 AT that time: Thomas, one of the
      twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. <BR />
      25 The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen
      the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands
      the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the
      nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.
<BR />
      26 And after eight days again his disciples were within, and
      Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and
      stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you. <BR />
      27 Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold
      my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side:
      and be not faithless, but believing. <BR />
      28 And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.
<BR />
      29 Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou
      hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have
      believed. <BR />
      30 And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his
      disciples, which are not written in this book: <BR />
      31 But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is
      the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have
      life through his name.</FONT></P>
