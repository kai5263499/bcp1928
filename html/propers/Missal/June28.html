      <B>INTROIT. <I>Lex veritatis. Mal. 2<BR />
      </I></B>THE law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not
      found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and
      did turn many away from iniquity. <I>Ps. </I>120. My soul hath
      long dwelt among them that are enemies unto peace: I labour for
      peace, but when I speak unto them thereof, they make them ready
      to battle.</P>

      O GOD, who didst bestow upon blessed Irenaeus thy Martyr and
      Bishop grace to overcome false doctrine by the teaching of the
      truth, and to stablish thy Church in peace and prosperity: we
      beseech thee, that thou wouldest give thy people constancy in
      thy true religion; and grant us thy peace all the days of our
      life. Through.</P>

      <P><BR />
      <B>The Epistle. <FONT COLOR="#000000">2 Timothy 3:14-4:5</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      14 Continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast
      been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;<BR />
      15 And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures,
      which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith
      which is in Christ Jesus.<BR />
      16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable
      for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
      righteousness:<BR />
      17 That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto
      all good works.<BR />
      1 I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ,
      who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his
      kingdom;<BR />
      2 Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove,
      rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.<BR />
      3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine;
      but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers,
      having itching ears;<BR />
      4 And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall
      be turned unto fables.<BR />
      5 But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work
      of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.</FONT></P>

      <P><B>The Gospel. St John 10:11-16</B><BR />
      11 I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life
      for the sheep.<BR />
      12 But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own
      the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep,
      and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.<BR />
      13 The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth
      not for the sheep.<BR />
      14 I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of
      mine.<BR />
      15 As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I
      lay down my life for the sheep.<BR />
      16 And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also
      I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be
      one fold, and one shepherd.</P>

      </B>O GOD, who sufferest not any terror to confound the nations
      that put their trust in thee: vouchsafe to accept the prayers
      and oblations of the people of thine inheritance; that by thy
      mercy all Christian lands may be stablished in peace, and preserved
      from the fear of their enemies. Through.</P>

      laboured for myself only, but for all them that seek wisdom.</P>

      <P><B>POSTCOMMUNION.<BR />
      </B>O GOD, who art the author of peace and lover of concord,
      in knowledge of whom standeth our eternal life, whose service
      is perfect freedom: defend us, thy humble servants, in all assaults
      of our enemies; that, at the intercession of blessed Irenaeus
      thy Martyr and Bishop, we, surely trusting in thy defence, may
      not fear the power of any adversaries. Through.</P>
