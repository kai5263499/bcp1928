      <P><B>EPISTLE. <I>Additions to Esther </I>13:8-17</B><BR>
      8 IN those days: Mardocheus thought upon all the works of the
      Lord, and made his prayer unto him,<BR>
      9 Saying, O Lord, Lord, the King Almighty: for the whole world
      is in thy power, and if thou hast appointed to save Israel, there
      is no man that can gainsay thee:<BR>
      10 For thou hast made heaven and earth, and all the wondrous
      things under the heaven.<BR>
      11 Thou art Lord of all things, and and there is no man that
      can resist thee, which art the Lord.<BR>
      12 Thou knowest all things, and thou knowest, Lord, that it was
      neither in contempt nor pride, nor for any desire of glory, that
      I did not bow down to proud Aman.<BR>
      13 For I could have been content with good will for the salvation
      of Israel to kiss the soles of his feet.<BR>
      14 But I did this, that I might not prefer the glory of man above
      the glory of God: neither will I worship any but thee, O God,
      neither will I do it in pride.<BR>
      15 And now, O Lord God and King, spare thy people: for their
      eyes are upon us to bring us to nought; yea, they desire to destroy
      the inheritance, that hath been thine from the beginning.<BR>
      16 Despise not the portion, which thou hast delivered out of
      Egypt for thine own self.<BR>
      17 Hear my prayer, and be merciful unto thine inheritance: turn
      our sorrow into joy, that we may live, O Lord, and praise thy
      name: and destroy not the mouths of them that praise thee, O
      Lord.</P>

      <P><B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps</I>. 28.</B> O Lord, save thy people, and
      give thy blessing unto thine inheritance. V. Unto thee will I
      cry, O Lord my strength : think no scorn of me, lest I become
      like unto them that go down into the pit.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>TRACT. <I>Ps</I>. 103. </B>O Lord, deal not with us after
      our sins; nor reward us according to wickednesses. V. Ps. 79.
      Lord, remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and
      that soon: for we are come to great misery. V. <I>(Here genuflect.)</I>
      Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name, O
      Lord: O deliver us and be merciful unto our sins, for thy Name's
      sake.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>GOSPEL. St. <I>Matthew</I> 20:17-28<BR>
      <FONT SIZE="-1"><IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></FONT></B>17
      AT that time: Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples
      apart in the way, and said unto them, <BR>
      18 Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be
      betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they
      shall condemn him to death, <BR>
      19 And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge,
      and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again. <BR>
      20 Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children with her
      sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him. <BR>
      21 And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him,
      Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand,
      and the other on the left, in thy kingdom. <BR>
      22 But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are
      ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be
      baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto
      him, We are able. <BR>
      23 And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and
      be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to
      sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but
      it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.
<BR>
      24 And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation
      against the two brethren. <BR>
      25 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the
      princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they
      that are great exercise authority upon them. <BR>
      26 But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great
      among you, let him be your minister; <BR>
      27 And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:
<BR>
      28 Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but
      to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</P>

      <P><B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps</I>. 25.</B> Unto thee, O Lord will I
      lift up my soul: my God, I have put my trust in thee, O let me
      not be confounded: neither let mine enemies triumph over me:
      for all they that hope in thee shall not be ashamed.</P>

      <P><B>SECRET.</B><BR>
      We pray thee, O Lord, look down in mercy on the sacrifice, which
      we here present unto thee : that we, drawing near unto thee in
      these holy mysteries, may by the same be delivered from the chains
      of the sins which we have committed. Through.</P>

      <P><B>COMMUNION. <I>Ps</I>. 11. </B>The righteous Lord loveth
      righteousness: his countenance will behold the thing that is
      just.</P>

      <P><B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR>
      O Lord, who here hast fed us with thy holy sacraments : grant,
      we pray thee : that we may thereby grow and increase toward the
      attainment of everlasting salvation. through.</P>

      <P><I>Over the people. </I>Let us pray. Bow down before the Lord.</P>

      <P><B>COLLECT.</B><BR>
      O God, the restorer and lover of innocency, we beseech thee to
      direct unto thyself the hearts of us thy servants : that being
      kindled with the fire of thy Spirit, we may be found stedfast
      in faith, and effectually given to all good works. through. <BR>
