          THE 19TH SUNDAY AFTER TRINITY<br />
        </font></b>

    </p>
    <p><br />
        <b>INTROIT. </b><i>Salus populi.<br />
        </i> I AM the salvation of my
      people, saith the Lord: in whatsoever tribulation they shall
      call upon me, I will hear them: and I will be their Lord for
      ever. <i>Ps. 78</i> Hear my law, O my people: incline your ears
      unto the words of my mouth. V. Glory be.<br />
        <br />
        <b>COLLECT.</b><br />
      O GOD, forasmuch as without thee we are not able to please thee:
      mercifully grant that thy Holy Spirit may in all things direct
      and rule our hearts; Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<br />
        <br />
        <b>EPISTLE. </b>Ephesians 4:17-32<br />
      17 This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth
      walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,<br />
      18 Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the
      life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of
      the blindness of their heart:<br />
      19 Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness,
      to work all uncleannesswith greediness.<br />
      20 But ye have not so learned Christ;<br />
      21 If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him,
      as the truth is in Jesus:<br />
      22 That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old
      man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;<br />
      23 And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;<br />
      24 And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created
      in righteousness and true holiness.<br />
      25 Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his
      neighbour: for we are members one of another.<br />
      26 Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your
      wrath:<br />
      27 Neither give place to the devil.<br />
      28 Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour,
      working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have
      to give to him that needeth.<br />
      29 Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but
      that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister
      grace unto the hearers.<br />
      30 And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed
      unto the day of redemption.<br />
      31 Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and
      evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:<br />
      32 And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one
      another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.<br />
        <br />
        <b>GRADUAL</b>. <i>Ps. 141 </i>Let my prayer be set forth in
      thy sight, as the incense, O Lord. V. And let the lifting up
      of my hands be an evening sacrifice.<br />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <i>Ps. 105</i> O give thanks unto thee
      Lord, and call upon his Name: tell the people what things he
      hath done. Alleluia.<br />
        <br />
        <b>GOSPEL.</b><i> St. </i>Matthew 9:1-8<br />
      1 And he entered into a ship,
      and passed over, and came into his own city.<br />
      2 And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying
      on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of
      the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.<br />
      3 And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves,
      This man blasphemeth.<br />
      4 And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil
      in your hearts?<br />
      5 For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or
      to say, Arise, and walk?<br />
      6 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth
      to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise,
      take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.<br />
      7 And he arose, and departed to his house.<br />
      8 But when the multitude saw it, they marvelled, and glorified
      God, which had given such power unto men.<br />
        <br />
        <b>OFFERTORY. </b><i>Ps. 138 </i>Though I walk in the midst of
      trouble, yet shalt thou refresh me, O Lord: thou shalt stretch
      forth thy hand upon the furiousness of mine enemies, and thy
      right hand shall save me.<br />
        <br />
        <b>SECRET.</b><br />
      O GOD, who by the wondrous operation of this sacrifice, dost
      make us partakers of thy glorious Godhead: grant, we beseech
      thee, that we which are taught the knowledge of thy truth, may
      in all our conversation walk worthily of the same. Through.<br />
        <br />
        <b>COMMUNION.</b> <i>Ps. 119 </i>Thou hast charged that we shall
      diligently keep thy commandments: O that my ways were made so
      direct, that I might keep thy statutes.<br />
        <br />
      POSTCOMMUNION.<br />
      WE render unto thee, O Lord, our hearty thanks, for that thou
      hast vouchsafed to quicken us with thy heavenly gifts: and we
      humbly beseech thy mercy, that thou wouldest make us worthy of
      those things which we have received. Through.</p>
