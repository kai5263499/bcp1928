      IN the midst of the congregation he opened his mouth: and the
      Lord filled him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding:
      he clothed him with a robe of glory (alleluia, alleluia). <I>Ps.
      </I>92. It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord: and
      to sing praises unto thy Name, O Most Highest. V. Glory be.</P>

      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      O GOD, who hast enlightened thy Church with the wondrous learning
      of thy blessed Confessor Saint Thomas, and enriched the same
      with his holiness of life: grant, we beseech thee; that we may
      both understand aright the doctrine that he taught, and also
      follow in all things the pattern of his conversation. Through.</P>

      <P><BR />
      <B>For the Epistle. <FONT COLOR="#000000">Wisdom 7:7-14<BR />
      </FONT></B>7 Wherefore I prayed, and understanding was given
      me: I called upon God, and the spirit of wisdom came to me.<BR />
      8 I preferred her before sceptres and thrones, and esteemed riches
      nothing in comparison of her.<BR />
      9 Neither compared I unto her any precious stone, because all
      gold in respect of her is as a little sand, and silver shall
      be counted as clay before her.<BR />
      10 I loved her above health and beauty, and chose to have her
      instead of light: for the light that cometh from her never goeth
      out.<BR />
      11 All good things together came to me with her, and innumerable
      riches in her hands.<BR />
      12 And I rejoiced in them all, because wisdom goeth before them:
      and I knew not that she was the mother of them.<BR />
      13 I learned diligently, and do communicate her liberally: I
      do not hide her riches.<BR />
      14 For she is a treasure unto men that never faileth: which they
      that use become the friends of God, being commended for the gifts
      that come from learning.</P>

      <P><B>GRADUAL. </B><I>Ps. </I>37. The Mouth of the righteous
      is exercised in wisdom: and his tongue will be talking of judgement.
      V. The law of his God is in his heart: and his goings shall not
      slide<BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>Ecclus </I>45. The Lord loved him and
      adorned him: he clothed him with a robe of glory. Alleluia.<BR />
<BR />
      <I>After Septuagesima, instead of the </I>Alleluia, <I>and verse
      following, is said:<BR />
<BR />
      </I><B>TRACT. </B><I>Ps. </I>112. Blessed is the man that feareth
      the Lord: he hath great delight in his commandments. V. His seed
      shall be mighty upon earthy: the generation of the faithful shall
      be blessed. V. Riches and plenteousness shall be in his housed:
      and his righteousness endureth for ever.<BR />
<BR />
      <I>In Eastertide, instead of the Gradual, is said:<BR />
<BR />
      </I>Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>Ecclus. </I>45. The Lord loved
      him and adorned him: he clothed him with a rob of glory. Alleluia.
      V. <I>Hosea </I>14. The righteous shall grow as the lily: and
      flourish for ever before the Lord. Alleluia.<BR />

      <P><B>The Gospel. St Matthew 5:13-20<BR />
      </B><FONT SIZE="-1">[From Mass 13, In medio]</FONT><BR />
      13 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his
      savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good
      for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot
      of men.<BR />
      14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill
      cannot be hid.<BR />
      15 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel,
      but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in
      the house.<BR />
      16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your
      good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.<BR />
      17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets:
      I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.<BR />
      18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one
      jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all
      be fulfilled.<BR />
      19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments,
      and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom
      of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall
      be called great in the kingdom of heaven.<BR />
      20 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed
      the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no
      case enter into the kingdom of heaven.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>OFFERTORY. </B><I>Ps. </I>92. The righteous shall flourish
      like a palm-tree: and shall spread abroad like a cedar in Libanus.
      (alleluia).<BR />
<BR />
      <B>SECRET.</B><BR />
      GRANT, O Lord, we pray thee that the devout prayers of the blessed
      Thomas thy Bishop and Doctor, may never fail to succour and defend
      us: that these our oblations may be rendered acceptable in thy
      sight; and that we may be made worthy to obtain for our sins
      the pardon of thy mercy. Through.<BR />
      <B><BR />
      COMMUNION. </B><I>St. Luke </I>12. A faithful and wise steward,
      whom his Lord hath made ruler over his household: to give them
      their portion of meat in due season (alleluia).<BR />
<BR />
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      GRANT, we beseech thee, O Lord, that thy holy Bishop and most
      excellent Doctor, blessed Thomas, may ever stand before thee
      as our advocate; that this sacrifice of thy ordinance may effectually
      avail for our salvation. Through.</P>

      <P><B>The Epistle. <FONT COLOR="#000000">Ecclesiasticus 39:5-10</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      5. The righteous will give his heart to resort early to the LORD
      that made him, and will pray before the Most High, and will open
      his mouth in prayer, and make supplication for his sins.<BR />
      6 When the great Lord will, he shall be filled with the spirit
      of understanding: he shall pour out wise sentences, and give
      thanks unto the Lord in his prayer.<BR />
      7 He shall direct his counsel and knowledge, and in his secrets
      shall he meditate.<BR />
      8 He shall shew forth that which he hath learned, and shall glory
      in the law of the covenant of the Lord.<BR />
      9 Many shall commend his understanding; and so long as the world
      endureth, it shall not be blotted out: his memorial shall not
      depart away, and his Name shall live from generation to generation.<BR />
      10 Nations shall shew forth his wisdom, and the congregation
      shall declare his praise.</FONT></P>
