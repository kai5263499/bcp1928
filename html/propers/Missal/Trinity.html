      BLESSED be the holy Trinity,
      and the undivided Unity: we will confess him, because he hath
      shewed his mercy upon us. <i>Ps. 8. </i>O Lord our Governour:
      how excellent is thy Name in all the world. V. Glory be.</p>
    <p><b>COLLECT</b>.<br />
      ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, who hast given unto us thy servants
      grace, by the confession of a true faith, to acknowledge the
      glory of the eternal Trinity, and in the power of the Divine
      Majesty to worship the Unity: we beseech thee; that thou wouldest
      keep us stedfast in this faith, and evermore defend us from all
      adversities. [Who.]</p>
    <p><b>FOR EPISTLE.<i> Revelation 4:1-11</i></b><br />
      1 After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven:
      and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet
      talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will show
      thee things which must be hereafter.<br />
      2 And immediately I was in the spirit; and, behold, a throne
      was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.<br />
      3 And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine
      stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight
      like unto an emerald.<br />
      4 And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and
      upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed
      in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.<br />
      5 And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings
      and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before
      the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.<br />
      6 And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal:
      and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were
      four beasts full of eyes before and behind.<br />
      7 And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like
      a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth
      beast was like a flying eagle.<br />
      8 And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and
      they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night,
      saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is,
      and is to come.<br />
      9 And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him
      that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,<br />
      10 The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on
      the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and
      cast their crowns before the throne, saying,<br />
      11 Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power:
      for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are
      and were created.</p>
    <p><b>GRADUAL. <i>Dan. 3. </i></b>Blessed art thou, that beholdest
      the depths, and sittest upon the Cherubim. V. Blessed art thou,
      O Lord, in the firmament of heaven,: and above all to be praised
      and glorified for ever.<br />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers:
      and to be praised and exalted above all for ever. Alleluia.</p>
    <p><b>GOSPEL. <i>St. John 3:1-15</i></b><br />
      At that time: 1 There was
      a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:<br />
      2 The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi,
      we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can
      do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.<br />
      3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto
      thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of
      God.<br />
      4 Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is
      old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and
      be born?<br />
      5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man
      be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the
      kingdom of God.<br />
      6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is
      born of the Spirit is spirit.<br />
      7 Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.<br />
      8 The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound
      thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it
      goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.<br />
      9 Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things
      be?<br />
      10 Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel,
      and knowest not these things?<br />
      11 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know,
      and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.<br />
      12 If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how
      shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?<br />
      13 And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down
      from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.<br />
      14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the<br />
      wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:<br />
      15 That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
      eternal life.<br />
        <br />
        <b>OFFERTORY. <i>Tob. 12 </i></b>Blessed be God the Father, and
      the only-begotten Son of God, and likewise the Holy Spirit: for
      he hath shewed his mercy upon us.</p>
    <p><b>SECRET.</b><br />
      O LORD GOD ALMIGHTY, we humbly beseech thee, that by the power
      of thy holy Name, thou wouldest vouchsafe to sanctify this oblation
      of our sacrifice: that we may thereby be enabled evermore to
      present ourselves unto thee to be an oblation acceptable in thy
      sight. [Through.]</p>
    <p><b>PREFACE</b> of the Most Holy Trinity.</p>
    <p><b>COMMUNION. <i>Tobit. 12 </i></b>We bless the God of heaven,
      and extol him before all the living: for he hath shewed his mercy
      upon us.</p>
    <p><b>POSTCOMMUNION.</b><br />
      O ETERNAL LORD GOD, who hast given unto us to acknowledge the
      holy and eternal Trinity to be likewise one undivided Unity:
      mercifully grant, that we, who have now received thy holy sacraments,
      may thereby be defended from all adversities which may happen
      to the body and from all evil thoughts which may assault and
      hurt the soul. [Through.]</p>
