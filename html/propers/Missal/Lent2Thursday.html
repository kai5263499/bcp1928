      <B>LESSON. <I>Jeremiah </I>17:5-10</B><BR>
      5 Thus saith the LORD; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man,
      and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the
      LORD. <BR>
      6 For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not
      see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in
      the wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited. <BR>
      7 Blessed is the man that trusteth in the LORD, and whose hope
      the LORD is. <BR>
      8 For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth
      out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh,
      but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the
      year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit. <BR>
      9 The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked:
      who can know it? <BR>
      10 I the LORD search the heart, I try the reins, even to give
      every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of
      his doings, saith the Lord Almighty.</P>

      <P><B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps</I>. 79.</B> Be merciful unto our sins,
      O Lord; wherefore do the heathen say: Where is now their God?
      V. Help us, O God of our salvation: for the glory of thy Name
      deliver us, O Lord.</P>

      <B>GOSPEL. <I>St. Luke </I>16:19-31<BR>
      <FONT SIZE="-1"><IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></FONT></B>19
      AT that time: Jesus said unto the Pharisees: There was a certain
      rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared
      sumptuously every day: <BR>
      20 And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid
      at his gate, full of sores, <BR>
      21 And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the
      rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.
<BR>
      22 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried
      by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and
      was buried; <BR>
      23 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth
      Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. <BR>
      24 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and
      send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water,
      and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. <BR>
      25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime
      receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things:
      but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented. <BR>
      26 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf
      fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot;
      neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence. <BR>
      27 Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest
      send him to my father's house: <BR>
      28 For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest
      they also come into this place of torment. <BR>
      29 Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets;
      let them hear them. <BR>
      30 And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them
      from the dead, they will repent. <BR>
      31 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets,
      neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.</P>

      <P><B>OFFERTORY. <I>Exod</I>. 32. </B>Moses besought the Lord
      his God, and said: Why, O Lord, doth thy wrath wax hot against
      thy people? Turn from thy fierce wrath; remember Abraham, Isaac,
      and Jacob, to whom thou swarest to give a land flowing with milk
      and honey; and the Lord repented of the evil which he thought
      to do unto his people.</P>

      <P><B>SECRET.</B><BR>
      Grant, O Lord, we pray thee, that the fast, which we have dedicated
      to the honour of thy Name, may by our present sacrifice be sanctified
      in thy sight: that this profession of our outward observance
      may inwardly work in us to good effect. Through.</P>

      <P><B>COMMUNION. <I>St. John.</I> 6.</B> He that eateth my Flesh
      and drinketh my Blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him, saith the
      Lord.</P>

      <P><B>POSTCOMMUNION</B>.<BR>
      We beseech thee, O Lord, that we thy servants, never failing
      of the succour of thy grace, may in all things be devoutly given
      to thy holy service and stablished by thy continual help. Through.</P>

      <P><I>Over the people.</I> Let us pray. Bow down before the Lord.</P>

      <P><B>COLLECT.</B><BR>
      Assist, O Lord, we pray thee, us thy servants, who call on the
      perpetual bounty of thy loving kindness : and, forasmuch as we
      do glory in thee alone, our author and our governour, vouchsafe
      that we may be in all things united and restored by thee, and
      evermore preserved in that state, whereunto thou dost restore
      us. through.</P>
