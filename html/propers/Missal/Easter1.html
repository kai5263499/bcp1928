        <b>INTROIT <i>Quasi modo. </i>1 <i>St. Peter </i>2</b><br />
        AS newborn babes, alleluia:
      desire the sincere milk of the word, alleluia, alleluia, alleluia. <i>Ps. </i>81 Sing we merrily unto God our strength: make a cheerful
      noise unto the God of Jacob. V. Glory be. <br />
        <br />
        <b>COLLECT.</b><br />
      ALMIGHTY FATHER, who hast given thine only Son to die for our
      sins, and to rise again for our justification: grant us so to
      put away the leaven of malice and wickedness, that we may always
      serve thee in pureness of living and truth; through the merits
      of the same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. <br />
        <br />
        <b>EPISTLE. 1 <i>Saint John</i> 5:4-12<br />
        </b>4 Whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and
      this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. <br />
      5 Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth
      that Jesus is the Son of God? <br />
      6 This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ;
      not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit
      that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth. <br />
      7 For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father,
      the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one. <br />
      8 And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit,
      and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one. <br />
      9 If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater:
      for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his
      Son. <br />
      10 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself:
      he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth
      not the record that God gave of his Son. <br />
      11 And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal
      life, and this life is in his Son. <br />
      12 He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son
      of God hath not life. <br />
        <br />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <i>St. Mt. </i>28 In the day of my Resurrection,
      saith the Lord, I will go before you into Galilee. Alleluia.
      V. <i>St. John 20.</i> After eight days, the door being shut,
      Jesus stood in the midst of his disciples and said: Peace be
      unto you. Alleluia.<br />
        <br />
        <b>GOSPEL. <i>Saint John</i> 20:19-23</b><br />
        19 Then the same day at evening,
      being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where
      the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus
      and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. <br />
      20 And when he had so said, he showed unto them his hands and
      his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord. <br />
      21 Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father
      hath sent me, even so send I you. <br />
      22 And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith
      unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost: <br />
      23 Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and
      whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained. <br />
        <br />
        <b>OFFERTORY. <i>St. Matthew </i>28<i>.</i> </b>The Angel of
      the Lord descended from heaven, and said unto the women: He whom
      ye seek is risen, as he said. Alleluia. <br />
        <br />
        <b>SECRET.</b><br />
      WE beseech thee, O Lord, mercifully to accept the prayers and
      oblations ACCEPT, O Lord, we pray thee, the gifts which in her
      gladness the Church doth offer unto thee: that they on whom thou
      hast bestowed the cause of so great a gladness may thereby be
      profited unto everlasting felicity. [Through.]<br />
        <br />
        <b>COMMUNION.</b> <i>St. John </i>20<i>.</i> Reach hither thy
      hand, and behold the print of the nails, alleluia: and be not
      faithless but believing, alleluia, alleluia. <br />
        <br />
        <b>POSTCOMMUNION</b>.<br />
      GRANT, we beseech thee, O Lord our God: that these holy mysteries
      which thou hast given unto us for the assurance of our salvation,
      may both in this life and that which is to come be profitable
      unto us for the healing of our souls. [Through.] <br />
