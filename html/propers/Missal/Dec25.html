      <P><B>INTROIT. <I>Dominus dixit. Ps. </I>2.<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B> THE Lord said unto me:
      Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. <I>Ps. ibid.
      </I>Why do the heathen so furiously rage together: and why do
      the people imagine a vain thing? V. Glory be. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>COLLECT.<BR />
      </B>O GOD, who makest us glad with the yearly remembrance of
      the Birth of thine only Son Jesus Christ: grant that as we joyfully
      receive him for our Redeemer, so we may with sure confidence
      behold him when he shall come to be our Judge. Who liveth and
      reigneth with thee and the Holy Ghost, one God, world without
      end. <BR />
<BR />
      O GOD, who hast enlightened this most holy night with the beams
      of thy one true light: grant, we beseech thee; that we, who have
      known the mystery of his light on earth, may also attain to the
      fruition of his joys in heaven. [Who.]<BR />
<BR />
      <B>EPISTLE. <I>Titus </I>2:11-15<BR />
      </B>11 For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared
      to all men, <BR />
      12 Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we
      should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present
      world; <BR />
      13 Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing
      of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; <BR />
      14 Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all
      iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous
      of good works. <BR />
      15 These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority.
      Let no man despise thee. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps.</I> 110. </B>In the day of thy power shall
      the people offer thee free-will offerings with an holy worship:
      the dew of thy Birth is of the womb of the morning. V. The Lord
      said unto my Lord: Sit thou on my right hand until I make thine
      enemies thy footstool.<BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>Ps. </I>2. The Lord said unto me: thou
      art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. Alleluia. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>St. Luke</I> 2:1-14<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B> 1 And it came to pass
      in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus,
      that all the world should be taxed. <BR />
      2 (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor
      of Syria.) <BR />
      3 And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city. <BR />
      4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth,
      into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem;
      (because he was of the house and lineage of David:) <BR />
      5 To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.
<BR />
      6 And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished
      that she should be delivered. <BR />
      7 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in
      swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was
      no room for them in the inn. <BR />
      8 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the
      field, keeping watch over their flock by night. <BR />
      9 And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory
      of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.<BR />
      10 And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring
      you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.
<BR />
      11 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour,
      which is Christ the Lord. <BR />
      12 And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe
      wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. <BR />
      13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly
      host praising God, and saying, <BR />
      14 Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will
      toward men. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps. </I>96. </B>Let the heavens rejoice and
      let the earth be glad before the Lord: for he is come. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>SECRET.<BR />
      </B>GRANT, O Lord, we pray thee, that the offerings, which on
      this day's festival we present unto thee, may be acceptable in
      thy sight: that by thy bounteous goodness vouchsafed unto us
      in this holy Communion, we may be found in the likeness of him
      in who our substance is united unto thee: And who liveth and
      reigneth with thee. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>COMMUNION. <I>Ps. </I>110. </B>With an holy worship: the dew
      of thy birth is of the womb of the morning.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      GRANT, we beseech thee, O Lord our God, that we who in a mystery
      have drawn near with gladness unto the Birth of Jesus Christ
      our Lord: may so walk in godliness of life, that we may be found
      worthy to attain unto his fellowship in heaven. [Who.]</P>

      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B> LIGHT shall shine today
      upon us: for unto us the Lord is born: and his Name shall be
      called Wonderful, Mighty God, the Prince of peace, Father of
      the world to come: of whose kingdom there shall be no end. <I>Ps.
      </I>93. The Lord is King and hath put on glorious apparel: the
      Lord hath put on his apparel and girded himself with strength.
      V. Glory be.</P>

      <P><B>COLLECT</B>.<BR />
      GRANT, we beseech thee, Almighty God: that, as thou hast poured
      forth upon us the new light of thine incarnate Word; so he, who
      doth illuminate our hearts by faith, may likewise in all our
      works shew forth his brightness. Through the same.</P>

      <P><B>EPISTLE. <I>Titus </I>3:4-7<BR />
      </B>4 DEARLY BELOVED: the kindness and love of God our Saviour
      toward man appeared, <BR />
      5 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according
      to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and
      renewing of the Holy Ghost; <BR />
      6 Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;
<BR />
      7 That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs
      according to the hope of eternal life.</P>

      <P><B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps. </I>118. </B>Blessed is he that cometh
      in the Name of the Lord: God is the Lord, who hath shewed us
      light. V. This is the Lord's doing: and it is marvellous in our
      eyes.<BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>Ps. </I>93. The Lord is King, and hath
      put on glorious apparel: the Lord hath put on his apparel, and
      girded himself with strength. Alleluia.</P>

      <P><B>GOSPEL. <I>St. Luke</I> 2:15-20<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B> 15 AT THAT TIME: the
      shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem,
      and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath
      made known unto us. <BR />
      16 And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and
      the babe lying in a manger. <BR />
      17 And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying
      which was told them concerning this child. <BR />
      18 And all they that heard it wondered at those things which
      were told them by the shepherds. <BR />
      19 But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.
<BR />
      20 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for
      all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto
      them. <I>The Creed is said.</I></P>

      <P><B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps. </I>93. </B>God hath made the round world
      so sure, that it cannot be moved: ever since the world began
      hath thy seat, O God, been prepared: thou art from everlasting.</P>

      <P><B>SECRET</B>.<BR />
      WE pray thee, O Lord, that these our oblations may be worthy
      of the mysteries which we celebrate on the Birth of thy Son,
      and may evermore shed forth thy peace within our hearts: that,
      even as he who was born in the substance of our manhood did shew
      forth therein the glory of the Godhead, so we, in these thy earthly
      creatures, may be made partakers of that which is heavenly. Through
      the same.</P>

      <P><B>COMMUNION. <I>Zech. </I>9.</B> Rejoice greatly, O daughter
      of Sion, shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh
      unto thee, he is just, and having salvation.</P>

      <P><B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      O LORD, who by thy wondrous Birth hast put off from us the old
      nature of our manhood: grant, we beseech thee; that by this new
      Sacrament of thy Nativity we may ever be inwardly renewed in
      our souls. Who liveth and reigneth with thee.</P>

      marvellous things. V. Glory be. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>COLLECT. <BR />
      </B>ALMIGHTY God, who hast given us thy only-begotten Son to
      take our nature upon him, and as at this time to be born of a
      pure Virgin: grant that we, being regenerate, and made thy children
      by adoption and grace, may daily be renewed by thy Holy Spirit.

<BR />
      <B>EPISTLE. <I>Hebrews</I> 1:1-12<BR />
      </B>1 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in
      time past unto the fathers by the prophets, <BR />
      2 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he
      hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;
<BR />
      3 Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image
      of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power,
      when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right
      hand of the Majesty on high; <BR />
      4 Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance
      obtained a more excellent name than they. <BR />
      5 For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art
      my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to
      him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son? <BR />
      6 And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world,
      he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him. <BR />
      7 And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits,
      and his ministers a flame of fire. <BR />
      8 But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and
      ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.
<BR />
      9 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore
      God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness
      above thy fellows. <BR />
      10 And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation
      of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands: <BR />
      11 They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall
      wax old as doth a garment; <BR />
      12 And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be
      changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.
<BR />
<BR />
<BR />
      <B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps. </I>98. </B>All the ends of the world have
      seen the salvation of our God: O be joyful in God, all ye lands.
      V. The Lord hath declared his salvation: in the sight of the
      heathen his righteousness hath he openly shewed.<BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. A hallowed day hath dawned upon us: come,
      all ye nations, and worship the Lord: for on this day a great
      light hath descended upon the earth. Alleluia. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>St. John</I> 1:1-14<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B> 1 In the beginning was
      the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. <BR />
      2 The same was in the beginning with God. <BR />
      3 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing
      made that was made. <BR />
      4 In him was life; and the life was the light of men. <BR />
      5 And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended
      it not. <BR />
      6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. <BR />
      7 The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light,
      that all men through him might believe. <BR />
      8 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that
      Light. <BR />
      9 That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh
      into the world. <BR />
      10 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the
      world knew him not. <BR />
      11 He came unto his own, and his own received him not. <BR />
      12 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become
      the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: <BR />
      13 Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh,
      nor of the will of man, but of God. <BR />
      14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld
      his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,)
      full of grace and truth. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps. </I>89. </B>The heavens are thine, the earth
      also is thine: thou hast laid the foundation of the round world,
      and all that therein is: righteousness and equity are the habitation
      of thy seat. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>SECRET.<BR />
      </B>WE beseech thee, O Lord, that by this new Birth of thy only-begotten
      Son thou wouldest vouchsafe to sanctify these our oblations:
      and to cleanse us from the defilement of all our iniquities.
      Through the same. <BR />

      <B>COMMUNION. <I>Ps. </I>98. </B>All the ends of the world have
      seen the salvation of our God.<BR />

      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.<BR />
      </B>GRANT, we beseech thee, Almighty God: that like as thy Son,
      born this day the Saviour of the world, hath been made the author
      of our heavenly birth; so he may bestow upon us the gift of everlasting
      life. [Who.]</P>
