          THE SEVENTH SUNDAY AFTER TRINITY<br />

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>INTROIT. <i>Omnes gentes. Ps. 47<br />
      </i></b>O CLAP your hands together,
      all ye people: O sing unto God with the voice of melody. <i>Ps.
        ibid. </i>For the Lord is high and to be feared: he is the great
      king upon all the earth. V. Glory be.</p>
    <p><b>COLLECT.</b><br />
      LORD of all power and might, who art the author and giver of
      all good things: graft in our hearts the love of thy Name, increase
      in us true religion; nourish us with all goodness, and of thy
      great mercy keep us in the same; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
      AMEN.</p>
    <p><b>EPISTLE. </b><i>Romans 6:19-23<br />
      </i>19 I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity
      of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to
      uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield
      your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.<br />
      20 For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.<br />
      21 What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now
      ashamed? for the end of those things is death.<br />
      22 But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God,
      ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.<br />
      23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal
      life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
    <p><b>GRADUAL. <i>Ps. </i></b>34<i> </i>Come, ye children, and
      hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord. V. They
      had an eye unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were
      not ashamed.<br />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <i>Ps. </i>47<i> </i>O clap your hands
      together, all ye people: sing unto God with the voice of melody.
      Alleluia</p>
    <p><b>GOSPEL. <i>St. Mark 8:1-9<br />
      </i></b>1 In those days the multitude
      being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his
      disciples unto him, and saith unto them,<br />
      2 I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been
      with me three days, and have nothing to eat:<br />
      3 And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will
      faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.<br />
      4 And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy
      these men with bread here in the wilderness?<br />
      5 And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said,
      Seven.<br />
      6 And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and
      he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave
      to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before
      the people.<br />
      7 And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded
      to set them also before them.<br />
      8 So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken
      meat that was left seven baskets.<br />
      9 And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent
      them away.</p>
    <p><b>OFFERTORY. <i>Ps</i></b><i>. <b>18</b></i><b> </b>Thou
      shalt save the people that are in adversity, O Lord, and shalt
      bring down the high looks of the proud: for who is God, but the
      Lord?</p>
    <p><b>SECRET.<br />
      </b>WE BESEECH thee, O Lord, to have compassion on our prayers,
      and graciously to accept the oblations of thy faithful people:
      and to the intent that none may ask amiss or fail in his petitions,
      grant, we beseech thee, that what we ask faithfully, we may obtain
      effectually. [Through.]</p>
    <p><b>COMMUNION. <i>Ps</i></b><i>. <b>31</b></i><b> </b>Bow down
      thine ear: make haste to deliver us.</p>
    <p><b>POSTCOMMUNION.</b><br />
      O LORD, who hast vouchsafed to satisfy us with these thy gifts:
      grant, we beseech thee; that the same may ever cleanse us by
      their operation, and defend us by their succour. [Through.]</p>
