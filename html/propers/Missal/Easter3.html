      <P><B>INTROIT. <I>Jubilate Deo. Psalm 66</I></B><BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" />O BE joyful in God, all ye
      lands, alleluia: sing praises unto the honour of his Name, alleluia:
      make his praise to be glorious, alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.
      <I>Ps. ibid. </I>Say unto God, O how wonderful art thou in thy
      works, O Lord: through the greatness of thy power shall thine
      enemies be found liars unto thee. V. Glory be.</P>

      <P><B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      ALMIGHTY GOD, who shewest to them that are in error the light
      of thy truth, to the intent that they may return into the way
      of righteousness: grant unto all those who are admitted into
      the fellowship of Christ's Religion that they may avoid those
      things that are contrary to their profession, and follow all
      such things as are agreeable to the same. [Through.]</P>

      <P><I>Seasonal Prayers as given after Low Sunday.</I></P>

      <P><B>EPISTLE.<I> 1 Saint Peter 2:11-17<BR />
      </I></B>11 Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims,
      abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;<BR />
      12 Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that,
      whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your
      good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of
      visitation.<BR />
      13 Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's
      sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;<BR />
      14 Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the
      punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.<BR />
      15 For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put
      to silence the ignorance of foolish men:<BR />
      16 As free, and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness,
      but as the servants of God.<BR />
      17 Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the
      king.</P>

      <P>Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>Psalm 111 </I>The Lord hath sent
      redemption unto his people. Alleluia. V. <I>St. Luke 24</I> Ought
      not Christ to have suffered these things: and to enter into his
      glory? Alleluia.</P>

      <P><B>GOSPEL. <I>Saint John 16:16-22</I></B><BR />
       16 A little while, and ye
      shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see
      me, because I go to the Father.<BR />
      17 Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is
      this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not
      see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and,
      Because I go to the Father?<BR />
      18 They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little
      while? we cannot tell what he saith.<BR />
      19 Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said
      unto them, Do ye inquire among yourselves of that I said, A little
      while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and
      ye shall see me?<BR />
      20 Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament,
      but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your
      sorrow shall be turned into joy.<BR />
      21 A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour
      is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth
      no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.<BR />
      22 And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again,
      and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from
      you.</P>

      <P><B>OFFERTORY.</B> <I>Ps. 146 </I>Praise the Lord, O my soul:
      while I live will I praise the Lord: yea, as long as I have any
      being, I will sing praises unto my God, alleluia.</P>

      <P><B>SECRET.</B><BR />
      O LORD, we pray thee, that from these mysteries we may obtain
      such succour of thy grace, that refraining ourselves from the
      desire of all things earthly, we may learn to love all such things
      as are heavenly. [Through.]</P>

      <P><B>COMMUNION. <I>St. John 16</I></B> A little while, and ye
      shall not see me, alleluia: and again a little while, and you
      shall see me, because I go to the Father, alleluia, alleluia.</P>

      <P><B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      O LORD our God, who hast made us partakers of this holy Sacrament:
      grant, we beseech thee; that we may be thereby inwardly satisfied
      with heavenly food, and outwardly defended against all adversities.
      Through.</P>
