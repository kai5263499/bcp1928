      <B>For the EPISTLE.</B> <I>Bel and the Dragon 29-42, Daniel 6:26-27</I><BR>
      29 So they came to the king, and said, Deliver us Daniel, or
      else we will destroy thee and thine house.<BR>
      30 Now when the king saw that they pressed him sore, being constrained,
      he delivered Daniel unto them:<BR>
      31 Who cast him into the lions' den: where he was six days.<BR>
      32 And in the den there were seven lions, and they had given
      them every day two carcases, and two sheep: which then were not
      given to them, to the intent they might devour Daniel.<BR>
      33 Now there was in Jewry a prophet, called Habbacuc, who had
      made pottage, and had broken bread in a bowl, and was going into
      the field, for to bring it to the reapers.<BR>
      34 But the angel of the Lord said unto Habbacuc, Go, carry the
      dinner that thou hast into Babylon unto Daniel, who is in the
      lions' den.<BR>
      35 And Habbacuc said, Lord, I never saw Babylon; neither do I
      know where the den is.<BR>
      36 Then the angel of the Lord took him by the crown, and bare
      him by the hair of his head, and through the vehemency of his
      spirit set him in Babylon over the den.<BR>
      37 And Habbacuc cried, saying, O Daniel, Daniel, take the dinner
      which God hath sent thee.<BR>
      38 And Daniel said, Thou hast remembered me, O God: neither hast
      thou forsaken them that seek thee and love thee.<BR>
      39 So Daniel arose, and did eat: and the angel of the Lord set
      Habbacuc in his own place again immediately.<BR>
      40 Upon the seventh day the king went to bewail Daniel: and when
      he came to the den, he looked in, and behold, Daniel was sitting.<BR>
      41 Then cried the king with a loud voice, saying, Great art Lord
      God of Daniel, and there is none other beside thee.<BR>
      42 And he drew him out, and cast those that were the cause of
      his destruction into the den: and they were devoured in a moment
      before his face.<BR>
      25 Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages,
      that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.<BR>
      26 I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men
      tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living
      God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall
      not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end.
      27 He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders
      in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power
      of the lions.</FONT></P>

      for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill
      him.<BR>
      2 Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.<BR>
      3 His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go
      into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou
      doest.<BR>
      4 For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he
      himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things,
      show thyself to the world.<BR>
      5 For neither did his brethren believe in him.<BR>
      6 Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your
      time is always ready.<BR>
      7 The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify
      of it, that the works thereof are evil.<BR>
      8 Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast;
      for my time is not yet full come.<BR>
      9 When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.<BR>
      10 But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto
      the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.<BR>
      11 Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is
      he?<BR>
      12 And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him:
      for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth
      the people.<BR>
      13 Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>OFFERTORY.</B> <I>Ps. 9. </I>They that know thy Name shall
      put their trust in thee: for thou, Lord, hast never failed them
      that seek thee: O praise the Lord which dwelleth in Sion: for
      he forgetteth not the complain of the poor.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>SECRET.</B><BR>
      Accept, O Lord, we pray thee, the sacrifice, which we here do
      offer and present unto thee: humbly beseeching thee, that it
      may in such wise be profitable unto us for our comfort in this
      present life, that we may ever hold fast the promises which thou
      hast given us of life eternal. Through.<BR>

      diligently after things eternal, may be found worthy to attain
      unto the gifts of thy heavenly bounty. Through.<BR>

      service increased. Through.<BR>
