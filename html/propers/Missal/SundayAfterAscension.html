      </I></B><IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" />HEARKEN unto my voice, O Lord,
      when I cry unto thee, alleluia: my heart hath talked of thee,
      Seek ye my face; thy face, Lord will I seek: O hide not thou
      thy face from me, alleluia, alleluia. <I>Ps. ibid. </I>The Lord
      is my light and my salvation: whom then shall I fear? V. Glory
      be.</P>

      <P><B>COLLECT</B>.<BR />
      O GOD, the King of glory, who hast exalted thine only Son Jesus
      Christ with great triumph unto thy kingdom in heaven; We beseech
      thee, leave us not comfortless; but send to us thine Holy Ghost
      to comfort us, and exalt us unto the same place whither our Saviour
      Christ is gone before, who liveth and reigneth with thee and
      the same Holy Ghost, one God, world without end. AMEN.</P>

      <P><I>Commemoration of the Ascension only.</I></P>

      <P><B>EPISTLE.<I> 1 St. Peter 4:7-11<BR />
      </I></B>7 THE end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober,
      and watch unto prayer.<BR />
      8 And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves:
      for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.<BR />
      9 Use hospitality one to another without grudging.<BR />
      10 As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the
      same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of
      God.<BR />
      11 If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if
      any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth:
      that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ,
      to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</P>

      <P>Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>Ps. 47 </I>GOD reigneth over the
      heathen: God sitteth upon his holy seat. Alleluia. V. <I>St.
      John 14 </I>I will not leave you comfortless: I go away and come
      again unto you, and your heart shall rejoice. Alleluia.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>Saint John 15: 26-16:4a<BR />
      </I></B><IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /> 26 WHEN the Comforter is
      come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit
      of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify
      of me:<BR />
      27 And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with
      me from the beginning.<BR />
      1 These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be
      offended.<BR />
      2 They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh,
      that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.<BR />
      3 And these things will they do unto you, because they have not
      known the Father, nor me.<BR />
      4 But these things have I told you, that when the time shall
      come, ye may remember that I told you of them.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>OFFERTORY.</B> <B><I>Ps. 47</I> </B>GOD is gone up with a
      merry noise: and the Lord with the sound of the trump, alleluia.</P>

      <P><B>SECRET.<BR />
      </B>GRANT, O Lord, that this spotless sacrifice may cleanse us
      from all our sins: and shed forth within our souls the strength
      of thy heavenly grace. [Through.]</P>

      <P><B>COMMUNION.</B> <B><I>St. John 17</I> </B>FATHER, while
      I was with them in the world, I kept those that thou gavest me,
      alleluia: and now I come to thee: I pray not that thou shouldest
      take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them
      from the evil, alleluia, alleluia.</P>

      <P><B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      O LORD, who hast vouchsafed to satisfy us with the sacred gifts
      of thy bounty: grant, we beseech thee, that we may ever continue
      to render thanks unto thee for the same. [Through.]<BR />
