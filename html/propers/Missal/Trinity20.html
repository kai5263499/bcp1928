      </i><b>INTROIT. <i>Omnia quae facisti - Song of the Three Children<br />
      </i></b>EVERYTHING that thou hast
      done to us O Lord, thou hast done in true judgement, for we have
      trespassed, and not obeyed thy commandments: but give glory to
      thy Name, and deal with us after thy loving-kindness. <i>Ps. </i>119<i> </i>Blessed are those that are undefiled in the way:
      and walk in the law of the Lord. V. Glory be.</p>
    <p><b>COLLECT.</b><br />
      O ALMIGHTY and most merciful God, of thy bountiful goodness keep
      us, we beseech thee, from all things that may hurt us; that we,
      being ready both in body and soul, may cheerfully accomplish
      those things which thou commandest; through Jesus Christ our
      Lord. AMEN</p>

      15 See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as
      wise, <br />
      16 Redeeming the time, because the days are evil. <br />
      17 Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will
      of the Lord is. <br />
      18 And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled
      with the Spirit; <br />
      19 Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,
      singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; <br />
      20 Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father
      in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; <br />
      21 Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.</p>
    <p><b>GRADUAL. <i>Ps. 145. </i></b>The eyes of all wait upon
      thee, O Lord: and thou givest them their meat in due season.
      V. Thou openest thine hand, and fillest all things living with
      plenteousness.<br />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V.<i> Ps. 108</i> O God, my heart is ready,
      my hear is ready: I will sing and give praise with the best member

    <p><a name="anchor121616" id="anchor121616"></a><b>GOSPEL. St. <i>Matthew 22:1-14</i></b><br />
      JESUS said, The kingdom of
      heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for
      his son, <br />
      3 And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to
      the wedding: and they would not come. <br />
      4 Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which
      are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my
      fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the
      marriage. <br />
      5 But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his
      farm, another to his merchandise: <br />
      6 And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully,
      and slew them. <br />
      7 But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent
      forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up
      their city. <br />
      8 Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they
      which were bidden were not worthy. <br />
      9 Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall
      find, bid to the marriage. <br />
      10 So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered
      together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the
      wedding was furnished with guests. <br />
      11 And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there
      a man which had not on a wedding garment: <br />
      12 And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not
      having a wedding garment? And he was speechless. <br />
      13 Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot,
      and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall
      be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <br />
      14 For many are called, but few are chosen.</p>
    <p><b>OFFERTORY. <i>Ps. </i>137.</b> By the waters of Babylon
      we sat down, and wept: when we remember thee, O Sion.</p>
    <p><b>SECRET.</b><br />
      GRANT, we beseech thee, O Lord, that these gifts, which we offer
      in the sight of thy majesty, may be profitable unto us for our
      salvation. [Through.]</p>
    <p><b>COMMUNION. <i>Ps. 119.</i></b> O think upon thy servant,
      as concerning thy word, O LORD, wherein thou hast caused me to
      put my trust: the same is my comfort in my trouble.</p>
    <p><b>POSTCOMMUNION.</b><br />
      GRANT, O LORD, that the power of thy healing may mercifully cleanse
      us from all our perversities: and make us ever to cleave stedfastly
      unto thy commandments. [Through.]</p>
