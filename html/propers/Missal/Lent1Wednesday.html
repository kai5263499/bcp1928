      <B>LESSON. <I>Exodus</I>&nbsp; 24:12-17</B><BR>
      12 IN those days: the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into
      the mount, and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone,
      and a law, and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest
      teach them. <BR>
      13 And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went
      up into the mount of God. <BR>
      14 And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we
      come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you:
      if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them. <BR>
      15 And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the
      mount. <BR>
      16 And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the
      cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto
      Moses out of the midst of the cloud. <BR>
      17 And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring
      fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.<BR>
      18 And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up
      into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty
      nights. <BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>GRADUAL.&nbsp; <I>Ps</I>. 25.&nbsp;</B> The sorrows of my
      heart are enlarged : O bring thou me out of my troubles, O Lord,
      V. Look upon my adversity and misery : and forgive me all my
      sin.<BR>

      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR>
      We beseech thee, O Lord, graciously to regard the devout prayers
      of thy people: that they, who by abstinence do mortify the deeds
      of the flesh, may by the fruit of good works be renewed in the
      spirit of their minds.&nbsp;&nbsp; Through<BR>

      <B>EPISTLE. I <I>Kings </I>19:3-8</B><BR>
      3 IN those days: Elijah came to Beer-sheba, which belongeth to
      Judah, and left his servant there. <BR>
      4 But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and
      came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for
      himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD,
      take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers. <BR>
      5 And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then
      an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat. <BR>
      6 And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baked on the coals,
      and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and
      laid him down again. <BR>
      7 And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched
      him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great
      for thee. <BR>
      8 And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength
      of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount
      of God. <BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>TRACT.&nbsp; <I>Ps</I>. 25.&nbsp;&nbsp;</B> O bring thou me
      out of my troubles, O Lord : look upon my adversity and misery:
      and forgive me all my sin.&nbsp; V.&nbsp; Unto thee, O Lord,
      will I lift up my soul, my God, I have put my trust in thee:
      O let me not be confounded: neither let mine enemies triumph
      over me.&nbsp; V.&nbsp; For all they that hope in thee shall
      not be ashamed: but such as do vain things shall be put to confusion.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>GOSPEL.<I> St. Matthew 12</I>:38-50</B><BR>
      &nbsp;<B><FONT SIZE="-1"><IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></FONT></B>38
      AT that time: certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered,
      saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee. <BR>
      39 But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous
      generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given
      to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas: <BR>
      40 For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's
      belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights
      in the heart of the earth. <BR>
      41 The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation,
      and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching
      of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here. <BR>
      42 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with
      this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the
      uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and,
      behold, a greater than Solomon is here. <BR>
      43 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through
      dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none. <BR>
      44 Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came
      out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.
<BR>
      45 Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits
      more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there:
      and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even
      so shall it be also unto this wicked generation. <BR>
      46 While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and
      his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him. <BR>
      47 Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren
      stand without, desiring to speak with thee. <BR>
      48 But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my
      mother? and who are my brethren? <BR>
      49 And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and
      said, Behold my mother and my brethren! <BR>
      50 For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven,
      the same is my brother, and sister, and mother. <BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>OFFERTORY.&nbsp; <I>Ps</I>. 119.</B>&nbsp; My delight shall
      be in thy commandments, which I have loved exceedingly: my hands
      also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>SECRET</B>.<BR>
      Accept, O Lord, we pray thee, this sacrifice, which we offer
      unto thee for the propitiation of our sins: that we, which have
      gone astray by reason of our frailty, may be pardoned by thy
      mercy and guided by thy power.&nbsp;&nbsp; Through.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>COMMUNION.&nbsp; Ps. 6.</B>&nbsp; Consider my meditation:
      O hearken thou unto the voice of my calling, my King and my God:
      for unto thee will I make my prayer, O Lord.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR>
      We beseech thee, O Lord, that this holy Sacrament, which we have
      received, may effectually cleanse us from our secret offences,
      and deliver us from all the assaults of our enemies.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Through.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <I>over the people.&nbsp; </I>Let us pray.&nbsp; Bow down before
      the Lord.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR>
      We beseech thee, O Lord, that thou wouldest in such wise enlighten
      our minds with the bright beams of thy light: that we may both
      see and know these things that we ought to do, and also by thee
      be enabled to perform the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; Through.<BR>
