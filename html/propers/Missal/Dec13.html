      <B>INTROIT. <I>Delexisti. Ps. </I>45.</B><BR />
      THOU hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity: therefore
      God even thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness
      above thy fellows (Alleluia, alleluia). <I>Ps. ibid. </I>My heart
      is inditing of a good matter: I speak of the things which I have
      made unto the King. V. Glory be.</P>

      <P><B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      GRACIOUSLY hear us, O God of our salvation: that, like as we
      do rejoice in the festival of blessed Lucy thy holy Virgin; so
      we may learn to follow her in all godly and devout affections.

      <B>The Epistle. 2 Corinthians 10:17-11:2</B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      17 BRETHREN: he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.<BR />
      18 For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the
      Lord commendeth.<BR />
      1 Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and
      indeed bear with me.<BR />
      2 For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused
      you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin
      to Christ.</FONT></P>

      <P><B>The Gospel. St Matthew 13:44-52</B><BR />
      44 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in
      a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for
      joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that
      field.<BR />
      45 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man,
      seeking goodly pearls:<BR />
      46 Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and
      sold all that he had, and bought it.<BR />
      47 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was
      cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:<BR />
      48 Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down,
      and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.<BR />
      49 So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come
      forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,<BR />
      50 And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall
      be wailing and gnashing of teeth.<BR />
      51 Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things?
      They say unto him, Yea, Lord.<BR />
      52 Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed
      unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder,
      which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.</P>

      <P><B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps. </I>45. </B>The virgins that be her fellows
      shall bear her company: they shall be brought unto thee with
      joy and gladness; and shall enter into the king's palace.</P>

      <P><B>SECRET</B>. <BR />
      GRANT, O Lord, we pray thee, that like as we thy faithful people
      do acknowledge that in the time of our tribulation we have been
      succoured by the merits of thy Saints: so this oblation, which
      we here do offer and present unto thee in their honour, may be
      acceptable in thy sight. Through.</P>

      <P><B>COMMUNION. <I>Ps. </I>119. </B>Princes have persecuted
      me without a cause, but my heart standeth in awe of thy word:
      I am as glad of thy word as one that findeth great spoils.</P>

      <P><B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      O LORD, who hast vouchsafed to feed us thy household with thy
      heavenly gifts: mercifully grant that we, who celebrate the feast
      of blessed Saint Lucy, thy Virgin, may at all times be comforted
      by her intercession. Through.</P>
