      <B>INTROIT. <I>Benedicite Dominum. Ps. </I>103.</B><BR />
      O PRAISE the Lord, ye Angles of his, ye that excel in strength:
      ye that fulfil his commandment, and hearken unto the voice of
      his words. <I>Ps. ibid. </I>Praise the Lord, O my soul: and all
      that is within me, praise his holy Name. V. Glory be.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      O EVERLASTING God, who hast ordained and constituted the services
      of Angels and men in a wonderful order; Mercifully grant that,
      as thy holy Angels always do thee service in heaven, so, by thy
      appointment, they may succour and defend us on earth; through
      Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><B>For the Epistle. Revelation xii. 7.</B><BR />
      IN those days: There was war in heaven: Michael and his angels
      fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,
      and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in
      heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent,
      called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world:
      he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out
      with him. And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come
      salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the
      power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast
      down, which accused them before our God day and night. And they
      overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their
      testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. Therefore
      rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters
      of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto
      you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but
      a short time.</P>

      <P><B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps. </I>103. </B>O praise the Lord, ye Angels
      of his, ye that excel in strength: ye that fulfil his commandment.
      V. O praise the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, praise
      his holy Name.<BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. Holy Michael Archangel, defend us in the
      day of battle: that we perish not in the dreadful judgement.
      Alleluia.</P>

      <P><I>In Eastertide, instead of the Gradual, is said </I>Alleluia
      <I>as above, to which is added,</I></P>

      <P>V. The sea was moved, and the earth trembled, when the Archangel
      Michael descended from heaven. Alleluia.</P>

      <P><I>After Septuagesima, the Gradual and Tract from Votive Mass
      2, of the Holy Angels.</I></P>

      <P><BR />
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>St. Matthew</I> 18:1.</B></P>

      <P>AT the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who
      is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? And Jesus called a
      little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, and
      said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become
      as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.
      Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child,
      the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And whoso shall
      receive one such little child in my name receiveth me. But whoso
      shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it
      were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck,
      and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. Woe unto the
      world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences
      come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh! Wherefore
      if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them
      from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed,
      rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting
      fire. And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it
      from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one
      eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell-fire. Take
      heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say
      unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face
      of my Father which is in heaven.</P>

      <P><I>The Creed is said.</I></P>

      <P><B>OFFERTORY. <I>Rev. </I>8, </B>An Angel stood at the altar
      of the temple, having a golden censer in his hand, and there
      was given unto him much incense: and the smoke of the incense
      ascended up before God, alleluia.</P>

      <P><B>SECRET.</B><BR />
      We humbly beseech thee, O Lord, that the prayers of thy holy
      Angels may assist us thy servants who offer unto thee this sacrifice
      of praise: that this our offering may be acceptable in thy sight,
      and profitable unto us for our salvation. Through.</P>

      <P><B>COMMUNION. <I>Song of the Three Children. </I></B>O ye
      Angels of the Lord, bless ye the Lord: sing ye praises, and magnify
      him above all for ever.</P>

      <P><B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      O LORD, who seest that we do trust in the intercession of blessed
      Michael thy Archangel: we humbly beseech thee; that as we have
      with our outward lips been made partakers of this holy Sacrament,
      so we may inwardly receive the benefit of the same. Through.</P>

      <P><I>&para; In Votive Masses all is said as above.</I></P>
