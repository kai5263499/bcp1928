      </I><B>EPISTLE. &nbsp;<I>Ezekiel</I> 34:11-16</B><BR>
      &nbsp;11 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, will both
      search my sheep, and seek them out. <BR>
      12 As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is
      among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep,
      and will deliver them out of all places where they have been
      scattered in the cloudy and dark day. <BR>
      13 And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them
      from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and
      feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in
      all the inhabited places of the country. <BR>
      14 I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains
      of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good
      fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains
      of Israel. <BR>
      15 I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith
      the Lord GOD. <BR>
      16 I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which
      was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and
      will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat
      and the strong; I will feed them with judgment, saith the Lord
      Almighty.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>GRADUAL.&nbsp; <I>Ps</I>. 84.&nbsp;</B> Behold, O God our
      defender: and look upon they servants.&nbsp;&nbsp; V. O Lord
      God of hosts, hear the prayers of they servants.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>TRACT. <I>Ps</I>. 103. </B>O Lord, deal not with us after
      our sins; nor reward us according to wickednesses. V. Ps. 79.
      Lord, remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and
      that soon: for we are come to great misery. V. <I>(Here genuflect.)</I>
      Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name, O
      Lord: O deliver us and be merciful unto our sins, for thy Name's
      sake.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>Matthew</I> 25:31-46<BR>
      <FONT SIZE="-1"><IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></FONT></B>31
      AT that time: Jesus said unto his disciples: When the Son of
      man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him,
      then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: <BR>
      32 And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall
      separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep
      from the goats: <BR>
      33 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats
      on the left. <BR>
      34 Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come,
      ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you
      from the foundation of the world: <BR>
      35 For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty,
      and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: <BR>
      36 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I
      was in prison, and ye came unto me. <BR>
      37 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw
      we thee an hungered, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee
      drink? <BR>
      38 When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and
      clothed thee? <BR>
      39 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?
<BR>
      40 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say
      unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of
      these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. <BR>
      41 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart
      from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil
      and his angels: <BR>
      42 For I was an hungered, and ye gave me no meat; I was thirsty,
      and ye gave me no drink: <BR>
      43 I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed
      me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. <BR>
      44 Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we
      thee an hungered, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick,
      or in prison, and did not minister unto thee? <BR>
      45 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you,
      Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did
      it not to me. <BR>
      46 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the
      righteous into life eternal. <BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps</I>. 119.</B>&nbsp; I will lift up mine eyes,
      O Lord, that I may see the wondrous things of thy law, that I
      may learn thy judgements: O give me understanding that I may
      learn they commandments.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>SECRET.</B><BR>
      We beseech&nbsp; thee, O Lord, that thou wouldest vouchsafe to
      sanctify these our oblations : and to cleanse us from the defilement
      of all our iniquities.&nbsp;&nbsp; through.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>COMMUNION.&nbsp; <I>St. Matt.</I> 25.&nbsp;</B> Verily I say
      unto you : Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least
      of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me : come ye blessed
      of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning
      of the world.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR>
      O Lord, who hast vouchsafed to bestow upon us the healing gifts
      of thy bounty : grant, we beseech thee; that, like as we do rejoice
      in the partaking of the same, so they may be inwardly profitable
      to the renewing of our souls.&nbsp; Through.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <I>Over the people.&nbsp; </I>Let us pray.&nbsp; Bow down before
      the Lord.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR>
<BR>
      We beseech thee, O Lord, absolve thy people from their offences
      : and of thy great mercy turn aside from us the punishment, which
      for the same we have most righteously deserved.&nbsp; through.<FONT SIZE="+1"><BR>
