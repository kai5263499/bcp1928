      I WILL speak of thy testimonies also even before kings, and will
      not be ashamed: and my delight shall be in thy commandments,
      which I have loved exceedingly. <I>Ps. </I>92. It is a good thing
      to give thanks unto the Lord: and to sing praises unto thy Name,
      O most highest. V. Glory be.</P>

      </B>WE PRAY thee, O Lord, that this solemn festival of John Baptist
      thy blessed Forerunner and Martyr: may effectually bestow upon
      us thy succour, to the attainment of everlasting salvation. Who
      livest and reignest with the Father.</P>

      <B>The Epistle. <FONT COLOR="#000000">Jeremiah 1:17-19</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      17 In those days: the word of the Lord came unto me, saying:
      gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I
      command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound
      thee before them.<BR />
      18 For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and
      an iron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against
      the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the
      priests thereof, and against the people of the land.<BR />
      19 And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail
      against thee; for I am with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver
      thee.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">GRADUAL. <I>Ps. </I>19. </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000">The righteous shall flourish like a palm-tree:
      and shall spread abroad like a cedar in Libanus in the house
      of the Lord. V. To tell of thy loving-kindness in the morning,
      and of thy truth in the night-season.<BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>Hosea </I>14. The righteous shall grow
      as the lily: and flourish for ever before the Lord. Alleluia.</FONT></P>

      <P><B>The Gospel. St Mark 6:17-29</B><BR />
      17 At that time: Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon
      John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother
      Philip's wife: for he had married her.<BR />
      18 For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to
      have thy brother's wife.<BR />
      19 Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have
      killed him; but she could not:<BR />
      20 For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and
      an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many
      things, and heard him gladly.<BR />
      21 And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday
      made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates
      of Galilee;<BR />
      22 And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced,
      and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto
      the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it
      thee.<BR />
      23 And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I
      will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.<BR />
      24 And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I
      ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.<BR />
      25 And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and
      asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger
      the head of John the Baptist.<BR />
      26 And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake,
      and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.<BR />
      27 And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded
      his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,<BR />
      28 And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel:
      and the damsel gave it to her mother.<BR />
      29 And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up
      his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.</P>

      <P><B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps. </I>21. </B>The righteous shall rejoice
      in thy strength, O Lord: exceeding glad shall he be of thy salvation:
      thou hast given him his heart's desire.</P>

      <P><B>SECRET.<BR />
      </B>WE pray thee, O Lord, that the gifts which we offer unto
      thee for the remembrance of the passion of thy blessed Martyr
      John Baptist: may, by his intercession, be rendered profitable
      unto us for our salvation. Through.</P>

      <P><B>COMMUNION. <I>Ps. </I>21. </B>Thou hast set a crown of
      pure gold upon his head, O Lord.</P>

      <P><B>POSTCOMMUNION.<BR />
      </B>WE pray thee, O Lord, that the observance of this festival
      of blessed John the Baptist: may enable us to venerate aright
      the meaning of the wondrous sacraments which we have received;
      and to rejoice abundantly in the fruits that they bring forth
      in us. Through.</P>
