      </I><B>LESSON. <I>I Kings </I>17:17-24</B><BR>
      17 IN those days: the son of the woman, the mistress of the house,
      fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath
      left in him. <BR>
      18 And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou
      man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance,
      and to slay my son? <BR>
      19 And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out
      of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode,
      and laid him upon his own bed. <BR>
      20 And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast
      thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by
      slaying her son? <BR>
      21 And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried
      unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this
      child's soul come into him again. <BR>
      22 And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the
      child came into him again, and he revived. <BR>
      23 And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the
      chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and
      Elijah said, See, thy son liveth. <BR>
      24 And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou
      art a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth
      is truth. <BR>
<BR>
      <B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps</I>. 118.</B> It is better to trust in the
      Lord, than to put any confidence in man. V. It is better to trust
      in the Lord, than to put any confidence in princes.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>TRACT. <I>Ps</I>. 103. </B>O Lord, deal not with us after
      our sins; nor reward us according to wickednesses. V. Ps. 79.
      Lord, remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and
      that soon: for we are come to great misery. V. <I>(Here genuflect.)</I>
      Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name, O
      Lord: O deliver us and be merciful unto our sins, for thy Name's
      sake.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>St. John </I>11:1-45<BR>
      </B><A HREF="mailto:apostle@episcopalnet.org"><IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>1
      AT that time: a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany,
      the town of Mary and her sister Martha. <BR>
      2 (It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and
      wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)
<BR>
      3 Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold,
      he whom thou lovest is sick. <BR>
      4 When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death,
      but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified
      thereby. <BR>
      5 Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. <BR>
      6 When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two
      days still in the same place where he was. <BR>
      7 Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea
      again. <BR>
      8 His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought
      to stone thee; and goest thou thither again? <BR>
      9 Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any
      man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light
      of this world. <BR>
      10 But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there
      is no light in him. <BR>
      11 These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our
      friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of
      sleep. <BR>
      12 Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.
<BR>
      13 Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he
      had spoken of taking of rest in sleep. <BR>
      14 Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead. <BR>
      15 And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the
      intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him. <BR>
      16 Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples,
      Let us also go, that we may die with him. <BR>
      17 Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave
      four days already. <BR>
      18 Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs
      off: <BR>
      19 And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them
      concerning their brother. <BR>
      20 Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went
      and met him: but Mary sat still in the house. <BR>
      21 Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here,
      my brother had not died. <BR>
      22 But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God,
      God will give it thee. <BR>
      23 Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again. <BR>
      24 Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in
      the resurrection at the last day. <BR>
      25 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life:
      he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:
<BR>
      26 And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.
      Believest thou this? <BR>
      27 She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the
      Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world. <BR>
      28 And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary
      her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth
      for thee. <BR>
      29 As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto
      him. <BR>
      30 Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that
      place where Martha met him. <BR>
      31 The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted
      her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out,
      followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.
<BR>
      32 Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she
      fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been
      here, my brother had not died. <BR>
      33 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping
      which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,
<BR>
      34 And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord,
      come and see. <BR>
      35 Jesus wept. <BR>
      36 Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him! <BR>
      37 And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the
      eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not
      have died? <BR>
      38 Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave.
      It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. <BR>
      39 Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of
      him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh:
      for he hath been dead four days. <BR>
      40 Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou
      wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God? <BR>
      41 Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead
      was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank
      thee that thou hast heard me. <BR>
      42 And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the
      people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou
      hast sent me. <BR>
      43 And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus,
      come forth. <BR>
      44 And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with
      graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus
      saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go. <BR>
      45 Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the
      things which Jesus did, believed on him. <BR>
<BR>
      OFFERTORY. <I>Ps</I>. 18. Thou shalt save the people that are
      in adversity, O Lord, and shalt bring down the high looks of
      the proud: for who is God, but the Lord?<BR>
<BR>
      <B>SECRET. </B><BR>
      Grant, O Lord, we pray thee, that these our oblations may in
      such wise purify us from all our iniquities, that we may ever
      be found an acceptable people in thy sight. Through.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>COMMUNION. <I>St. John </I>11. </B>The Lord, seeing the sisters
      of Lazarus weeping at the tomb, wept before the Jews, and cried:
      Lazarus, come forth : and he that had been dead four days came
      forth, bound hand and foot.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR>
      Grant, O Lord, that we which have here received this holy Sacrament,
      may thereby be delivered evermore from the bonds of our sins,
      and defended against all adversities. Through.<BR>
<BR>
      <I>Over the people. </I>Let us pray. Bow down before the Lord.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR>
      Almighty God, who seest that we, knowing ourselves to be compassed
      about by many and great infirmities, do put our whole trust and
      confidence in thy mighty power, may evermore rejoice in the abundance
      of thy loving-kindness. Through.<BR>
