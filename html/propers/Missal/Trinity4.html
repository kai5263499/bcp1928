          THE FOURTH SUNDAY AFTER TRINITY<br />

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>INTROIT. <i>Dominus illuminatio mea. Ps. 27.<br />
      </i></b> THE LORD is my light, and
      my salvation, whom then shall I fear? The LORD is the strength
      of my life, of whom then shall I be afraid? When mine enemies
      came upon me, they stumbled and fell. <i>Ps. ibid. </i>Though
      an host of men were laid against me: yet shall not my heart be
      afraid. V. Glory be.</p>
    <p><b>COLLECT</b>.<br />
      O GOD the protector of all that trust in thee, without whom nothing
      is strong, nothing is holy: increase and multiply upon us thy
      mercy; that, thou being our ruler and guide, we may so pass through
      things temporal, that we finally lose not the things eternal:
      Grant this, O heavenly Father, for the sake of Jesus Christ our
      Lord. <i>Amen.</i></p>
    <p><b>EPISTLE<i>.</i> <i>Romans</i> 8:18-23</b><br />
      18 I RECKON that the sufferings of this present time are not
      worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed
      in us.<br />
      19 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the
      manifestation of the sons of God.<br />
      20 For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly,
      but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,<br />
      21 Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the
      bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children
      of God.<br />
      22 For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth
      in pain together until now.<br />
      23 And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits
      of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting
      for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.</p>
    <p><b>GRADUAL.<i> Ps. 79.</i></b> Be merciful unto our sins,
      O Lord: wherefore do the heathen say: Where is now their God?
      V. Help us, O God of our salvation: and for the glory of thy
      Name, deliver us, O Lord.<br />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <i>Ps. 9.</i> thou O God, are set in the
      throne that judgest right: be thou the refuge of the opprest
      in due time of trouble. Alleluia.</p>
    <p><b>GOSPEL. <i>St. Luke </i>6:36-42</b><br />
      36 AT that time; Jesus said
      to his disciples: Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also
      is merciful.<br />
      37 Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye
      shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:<br />
      38 Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed
      down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into
      your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it
      shall be measured to you again.<br />
      39 And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind?
      shall they not both fall into the ditch?<br />
      40 The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is
      perfect shall be as his master.<br />
      41 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye,
      but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?<br />
      42 Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me
      pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest
      not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out
      first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see
      clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.</p>
    <p><b>OFFERTORY</b>. <i>Ps. 13.</i> Lighten mine eyes, that I
      sleep not in death : lest mine enemy say: I have prevailed against
      him.</p>
    <p><b>SECRET.</b><br />
      REGARD, O Lord, we pray thee, the prayers and oblations of thy
      Church: and grant that they may ever be profitable for the salvation
      and sanctification of us thy faithful people. through.</p>
    <p><b>COMMUNION</b>. <i>Ps. 18.</i> The Lord is my stony rock,
      and my defence: my Saviour, my god, and my might.</p>
    <p><b>POSTCOMMUNION</b>.<br />
      WE PRAY thee, O Lord, that we being quickened by these mysteries
      which we have received: may thereby be cleansed from all our
      sins; and made ready for the obtaining of thy everlasting mercy.
      [Through.]<br />
