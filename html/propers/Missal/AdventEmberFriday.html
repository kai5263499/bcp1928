      <B>The Lesson. <I>Isaiah </I>11:1-5. <I>Vulgate.</I></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 THUS saith the Lord God: there shall come forth a rod out of
      the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:
<BR />
      2 And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit
      of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might,
      the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD; <BR />
      3 And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the
      LORD: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither
      reprove after the hearing of his ears: <BR />
      4 But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove
      with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the
      earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips
      shall he slay the wicked. <BR />
      5 And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness
      the girdle of his reins.</FONT></P>

      <P><B>GOSPEL.<I> St Luke</I> 1:39-47</B><BR />
      39 AT that time: Mary arose in those days, and went into the
      hill country with haste, into a city of Judah; <BR />
      40 And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.
<BR />
      41 And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation
      of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled
      with the Holy Ghost: <BR />
      42 And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art
      thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. <BR />
      43 And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should
      come to me? <BR />
      44 For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in
      mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. <BR />
      45 And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance
      of those things which were told her from the Lord. <BR />
      46 And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord, <BR />
      47 And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.</P>

      <P><B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps. </I>85. </B>Wilt thou not turn again
      and quicken us, O God, that thy people may rejoice in thee: shew
      us thy mercy, O Lord, and grant us thy salvation.</P>

      <P><B>SECRET</B>. <BR />
      WE beseech thee, O Lord,graciously to accept these our prayers
      and oblations: that we, being cleansed by these heavenly mysteries,
      may obtain of thy great mercy the fulfilment of all our desires.
      Through.</P>

      <P><B>COMMUNION. <I>Zech. </I>14. </B>Behold the Lord shall come,
      and all his Saints with him: and in that day there shall be a
      great light.</P>

      <P><B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      GRANT, O Lord, that this holy Sacrament which we have received
      may in such wise deliver us from the sins of our former nature:
      that we may be worthy to enter into the fellowship of thy saving
      mysteries. Through.</P>
