      </I><B>LESSON. <I>The story of Susanna.</I> 1-62.<BR>
      </B>1 IN those days: There dwelt a man in Babylon, called Joacim:<BR>
      2 And he took a wife, whose name was Susanna, the daughter of
      Chelcias, a very fair woman, and one that feared the Lord.<BR>
      3 Her parents also were righteous, and taught their daughter
      according to the law of Moses.<BR>
      4 Now Joacim was a great rich man, and had a fair garden joining
      unto his house: and to him resorted the Jews; because he was
      more honourable than all others.<BR>
      5 The same year were appointed two of the ancients of the people
      to be judges, such as the Lord spake of, that wickedness came
      from Babylon from ancient judges, who seemed to govern the people.<BR>
      6 These kept much at Joacim's house: and all that had any suits
      in law came unto them.<BR>
      7 Now when the people departed away at noon, Susanna went into
      her husband's garden to walk.<BR>
      8 And the two elders saw her going in every day, and walking;
      so that their lust was inflamed toward her.<BR>
      9 And they perverted their own mind, and turned away their eyes,
      that they might not look unto heaven, nor remember just judgments.<BR>
      10 And albeit they both were wounded with her love, yet durst
      not one shew another his grief.<BR>
      11 For they were ashamed to declare their lust, that they desired
      to have to do with her.<BR>
      12 Yet they watched diligently from day to day to see her.<BR>
      13 And the one said to the other, Let us now go home: for it
      is dinner time.<BR>
      14 So when they were gone out, they parted the one from the other,
      and turning back again they came to the same place; and after
      that they had asked one another the cause, they acknowledged
      their lust: then appointed they a time both together, when they
      might find her alone.<BR>
      15 And it fell out, as they watched a fit time, she went in as
      before with two maids only, and she was desirous to wash herself
      in the garden: for it was hot.<BR>
      16 And there was no body there save the two elders, that had
      hid themselves, and watched her.<BR>
      17 Then she said to her maids, Bring me oil and washing balls,
      and shut the garden doors, that I may wash me.<BR>
      18 And they did as she bade them, and shut the garden doors,
      and went out themselves at privy doors to fetch the things that
      she had commanded them: but they saw not the elders, because
      they were hid.<BR>
      19 Now when the maids were gone forth, the two elders rose up,
      and ran unto her, saying,<BR>
      20 Behold, the garden doors are shut, that no man can see us,
      and we are in love with thee; therefore consent unto us, and
      lie with us.<BR>
      21 If thou wilt not, we will bear witness against thee, that
      a young man was with thee: and therefore thou didst send away
      thy maids from thee.<BR>
      22 Then Susanna sighed, and said, I am straitened on every side:
      for if I do this thing, it is death unto me: and if I do it not
      I cannot escape your hands.<BR>
      23 It is better for me to fall into your hands, and not do it,
      than to sin in the sight of the Lord.<BR>
      24 With that Susanna cried with a loud voice: and the two elders
      cried out against her.<BR>
      25 Then ran the one, and opened the garden door.<BR>
      26 So when the servants of the house heard the cry in the garden,
      they rushed in at the privy door, to see what was done unto her.<BR>
      27 But when the elders had declared their matter, the servants
      were greatly ashamed: for there was never such a report made
      of Susanna.<BR>
      28 And it came to pass the next day, when the people were assembled
      to her husband Joacim, the two elders came also full of mischievous
      imagination against Susanna to put her to death;<BR>
      29 And said before the people, Send for Susanna, the daughter
      of Chelcias, Joacim's wife. And so they sent.<BR>
      30 So she came with her father and mother, her children, and
      all her kindred.<BR>
      31 Now Susanna was a very delicate woman, and beauteous to behold.<BR>
      32 And these wicked men commanded to uncover her face, (for she
      was covered) that they might be filled with her beauty.<BR>
      33 Therefore her friends and all that saw her wept.<BR>
      34 Then the two elders stood up in the midst of the people, and
      laid their hands upon her head.<BR>
      35 And she weeping looked up toward heaven: for her heart trusted
      in the Lord.<BR>
      36 And the elders said, As we walked in the garden alone, this
      woman came in with two maids, and shut the garden doors, and
      sent the maids away.<BR>
      37 Then a young man, who there was hid, came unto her, and lay
      with her.<BR>
      38 Then we that stood in a corner of the garden, seeing this
      wickedness, ran unto them.<BR>
      39 And when we saw them together, the man we could not hold:
      for he was stronger than we, and opened the door, and leaped
      out.<BR>
      40 But having taken this woman, we asked who the young man was,
      but she would not tell us: these things do we testify.<BR>
      41 Then the assembly believed them as those that were the elders
      and judges of the people: so they condemned her to death.<BR>
      42 Then Susanna cried out with a loud voice, and said, O everlasting
      God, that knowest the secrets, and knowest all things before
      they be:<BR>
      43 Thou knowest that they have borne false witness against me,
      and, behold, I must die; whereas I never did such things as these
      men have maliciously invented against me.<BR>
      44 And the Lord heard her voice.<BR>
      45 Therefore when she was led to be put to death, the Lord raised
      up the holy spirit of a young youth whose name was Daniel:<BR>
      46 Who cried with a loud voice, I am clear from the blood of
      this woman.<BR>
      47 Then all the people turned them toward him, and said, What
      mean these words that thou hast spoken?<BR>
      48 So he standing in the midst of them said, Are ye such fools,
      ye sons of Israel, that without examination or knowledge of the
      truth ye have condemned a daughter of Israel?<BR>
      49 Return again to the place of judgment: for they have borne
      false witness against her.<BR>
      50 Wherefore all the people turned again in haste, and the elders
      said unto him, Come, sit down among us, and shew it us, seeing
      God hath given thee the honour of an elder.<BR>
      51 Then said Daniel unto them, Put these two aside one far from
      another, and I will examine them.<BR>
      52 So when they were put asunder one from another, he called
      one of them, and said unto him, O thou that art waxen old in
      wickedness, now thy sins which thou hast committed aforetime
      are come to light.<BR>
      53 For thou hast pronounced false judgment and hast condemned
      the innocent and hast let the guilty go free; albeit the Lord
      saith, The innocent and righteous shalt thou not slay.<BR>
      54 Now then, if thou hast seen her, tell me, Under what tree
      sawest thou them companying together? Who answered, Under a mastick
      tree.<BR>
      55 And Daniel said, Very well; thou hast lied against thine own
      head; for even now the angel of God hath received the sentence
      of God to cut thee in two.<BR>
      56 So he put him aside, and commanded to bring the other, and
      said unto him, O thou seed of Chanaan, and not of Juda, beauty
      hath deceived thee, and lust hath perverted thine heart.<BR>
      57 Thus have ye dealt with the daughters of Israel, and they
      for fear companied with you: but the daughter of Juda would not
      abide your wickedness.<BR>
      58 Now therefore tell me, Under what tree didst thou take them
      companying together? Who answered, Under an holm tree.<BR>
      59 Then said Daniel unto him, Well; thou hast also lied against
      thine own head: for the angel of God waiteth with the sword to
      cut thee in two, that he may destroy you.<BR>
      60 With that all the assembly cried out with a loud voice, and
      praised God, who saveth them that trust in him.<BR>
      61 And they arose against the two elders, for Daniel had convicted
      them of false witness by their own mouth:<BR>
      62 And according to the law of Moses they did unto them in such
      sort as they maliciously intended to do to their neighbour: and
      they put them to death. Thus the innocent blood was saved the
      same day.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      <B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps</I>. 23. </B>Though I walk through the valley
      of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with
      me, O Lord. V. Thy rod and thy staff comfort me.<BR>

      AT that time: Jesus went unto the mount of Olives. <BR>
      2 And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and
      all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.
<BR>
      3 And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken
      in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst, <BR>
      4 They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery,
      in the very act. <BR>
      5 Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned:
      but what sayest thou? <BR>
      6 This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse
      him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the
      ground, as though he heard them not. <BR>
      7 So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and
      said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first
      cast a stone at her. <BR>
      8 And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. <BR>
      9 And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience,
      went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last:
      and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.
<BR>
      10 When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman,
      he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath
      no man condemned thee? <BR>
      11 She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do
      I condemn thee: go, and sin no more. <BR>
<BR>
      <B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps</I>. 119. </B>Order my steps in thy word:
      and so shall no wickedness have dominion over me, O Lord.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>SECRET</B>.<BR>
      Grant, we beseech thee, Almighty God: that this oblation of our
      sacrifice may in all things purify the fraility of our mortal
      nature from all evil, and be our defence against all temptations.
      Through.<BR>
      <B><BR>
      COMMUNION. <I>St. John </I>8. </B>Woman, hath no man condemned
      thee? No man, Lord. Neither do I condemn thee: go and sin no
      more.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR>
      We humbly beseech thee, Almighty God: that we who have duly received
      the Body and Blood of thy son Jesus Christ our Lord, may thereby
      be made very members incorporate in him. Through the same.<BR>
<BR>
      <I>Over the people. </I>Let us pray. Bow down before the Lord<BR>
<BR>
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR>
      Stretch forth, O Lord, we pray thee, on thy faithful people the
      right hand of thy heavenly succour: that they, diligently seeking
      thee with all their hearts, may be found worthy to obtain those
      things that they have asked according to thy will. Through.</P>
