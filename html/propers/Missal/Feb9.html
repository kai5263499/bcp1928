      be.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>COLLECT.<BR />
      </B>O GOD, who didst strengthen thy blessed Confessor and Bishop
      Saint Cyril, invincibly to maintain the divine motherhood of
      the blessed Virgin Mary: vouchsafe that at his intercession we,
      believing her to be indeed the Mother of God; may as her children
      rejoice in her protection. [Through]</P>

      <B>EPSTLE. <I><FONT COLOR="#000000">Ecclesiasticus</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#000000"> 39:5-10</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      5. The righteous will give his heart to resort early to the LORD
      that made him, and will pray before the Most High, and will open
      his mouth in prayer, and make supplication for his sins.<BR />
      6 When the great Lord will, he shall be filled with the spirit
      of understanding: he shall pour out wise sentences, and give
      thanks unto the Lord in his prayer.<BR />
      7 He shall direct his counsel and knowledge, and in his secrets
      shall he meditate.<BR />
      8 He shall shew forth that which he hath learned, and shall glory
      in the law of the covenant of the Lord.<BR />
      9 Many shall commend his understanding; and so long as the world
      endureth, it shall not be blotted out: his memorial shall not
      depart away, and his Name shall live from generation to generation.<BR />
      10 Nations shall shew forth his wisdom, and the congregation
      shall declare his praise.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps. </I>132. </B>I will deck her priests with
      health: and her Saints shall rejoice and sing. V. There shall
      I make the horn of David to flourish: I have ordained a lantern
      for mine Anointed.<BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>Ps. </I>110. The Lord sware and will
      not repent: thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedech.
      l Alleluia.<BR />
<BR />
      <I>After Septuagesima, instead of the </I>Alleluia, <I>and verse
      following, is said:<BR />
<BR />
      </I><B>TRACT. <I>Ps. </I>112</B>. Blessed is the man that feareth
      the Lord: he hath great delight in his commandments. V. His seed
      shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the faithful shall
      be blessed. V. Riches and plenteousness shall be in his house:
      and his righteousness endureth for ever.<BR />
<BR />
      <I>In Eastertide, instead off the Gradual, is said:<BR />
<BR />
      </I>Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>Ps. </I>110. The Lord sware and
      will not repent: thou art a priest for ever after the order of
      Melchisedech. Alleluia. V. <I>Ecclus. </I>45. The Lord loved
      him and adorned him: he clothed him with a robe of glory. Alleluia.</FONT></P>

      <P><B>GOPEL. St Matthew 5:13-20</B><BR />
      13 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his
      savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good
      for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot
      of men.<BR />
      14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill
      cannot be hid.<BR />
      15 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel,
      but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in
      the house.<BR />
      16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your
      good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.<BR />
      17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets:
      I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.<BR />
      18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one
      jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all
      be fulfilled.<BR />
      19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments,
      and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom
      of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall
      be called great in the kingdom of heaven.<BR />
      20 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed
      the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no
      case enter into the kingdom of heaven.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>SECRET.<BR />
      </B>ALMIGHTY GOD, look down in mercy upon these our offerings:
      and grant that we may be found worthy to receive within our hearts
      thine only-begotten Son, co-eternal with thee in thy glory, even
      Jesus Christ our Lord. Who liveth and reigneth with Thee.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>COMMUNION. <BR />
      </B><I>St. Matthew </I>24. Blessed is that servant whom his lord
      when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that
      he shall make him ruler over all his goods (alleluia).<B><BR />
<BR />
      POSTCOMMUNION.<BR />
      </B>O LORD, who hast refreshed us with these heavenly mysteries:
      we humbly beseech thee; that by the merits and example of blessed
      Cyril thy Bishop, we may be enabled worthily to serve the mot
      holy Mother of thine only begotten Son. Who liveth and reigneth
      with thee.</P>
