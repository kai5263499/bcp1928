      <P><BR />
      <B>INTROIT <I>Misericordia Domini. Ps. </I>33.</B><BR />
      The earth is full of the goodness
      of the Lord, alleluia: by the word of the Lord were the heaven
      made, alleluia, alleluia. <I>Ps. ibid. </I>Rejoice in the Lord,
      O ye righteous: for it becometh well the just to be thankful
      V. Glory be. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      ALMIGHTY GOD, who hast given thine only Son to be unto us both
      a sacrifice for sin, and also an ensample of godly life: give
      us grace that we may always most thankfully receive that his
      inestimable benefit, and also daily endeavour ourselves to follow
      the blessed steps of his most holy life; through the same thy
      Son Jesus Christ our Lord. AMEN. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>EPISTLE. 1<I> Saint Peter</I> 2:19-25<BR />
      </B>19 THIS is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God
      endure grief, suffering wrongfully. <BR />
      20 For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults,
      ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer
      for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God. <BR />
      21 For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered
      for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:
<BR />
      22 Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: <BR />
      23 Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered,
      he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth
      righteously: <BR />
      24 Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree,
      that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness:
      by whose stripes ye were healed. <BR />
      25 For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto
      the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls. <BR />
<BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>St. Luke </I>24 The disciples knew
      the Lord Jesus in the breaking of bread. Alleluia. V. <I>St.
      John 10.</I> I am the Good Shepherd: and know my sheep, and am
      known of mine. Alleluia.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>GOSPEL.<I> Saint John </I>10:11-16</B><BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" />11 I am the good shepherd:
      the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. <BR />
      12 But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own
      the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep,
      and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.
<BR />
      13 The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth
      not for the sheep. <BR />
      14 I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of
      mine. <BR />
      15 As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I
      lay down my life for the sheep. <BR />
      16 And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also
      I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be
      one fold, and one shepherd. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>OFFERTORY.</B> <B><I>Ps. </I>63.<I> </I></B>O God, thou art
      my God, early will I seek thee: and I will lift up my hands in
      thy Name, alleluia.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>SECRET.</B><BR />
      WE PRAY thee, O Lord, that this holy oblation may ever obtain
      for us thy heavenly blessing: that those things which we shew
      forth in an outward mystery may effectually be accomplished in
      our inward souls. [Through.] <BR />
<BR />
      <B>COMMUNION. <I>St. John </I>10<I>.</I> </B>I am the Good Shepherd,
      alleluia: and know my sheep, and am known of mine, alleluia,
      alleluia.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      GRANT, we beseech thee, Almighty God, that we receiving the quickening
      of thy grace, may ever glory in the gift which thou bestowest.
      [Through.] <BR />
