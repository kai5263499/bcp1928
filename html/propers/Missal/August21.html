      <B>INTROIT. </B><I>Cognovi. Ps. </I>119<BR />
      I know, O Lord, that thy judgements are right, and that thou
      of very faithfulness hast cause me to be troubled: my flesh trembleth
      for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy judgements (alleluia,
      alleluia). <I>Ps. ibid. </I>Blessed are those that are undefiled
      in the way: and walk in the law of the Lord. V. Glory be.</P>

      <P><BR />
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      ALMIGHTY and most merciful God, who didst enkindle blessed Jane
      Frances with the fire of thy love, and endue her with wondrous
      constancy to walk stedfastly in all the paths of her life on
      the way of perfection, and who through here didst vouchsafe to
      glorify thy Church with a new offspring: grant, we pray thee,
      by her merits and intercession; that we, who, knowing the frailty
      of our mortal nature do put our trust and confidence in thy mighty
      power, may, by the help of thy heavenly grace, overcome all things
      that are contrary to our salvation. Through.</P>

      <B>For the Epistle. <FONT COLOR="#000000">Proverbs 31:10-31</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      10 Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above
      rubies.<BR />
      11 The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that
      he shall have no need of spoil.<BR />
      12 She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.<BR />
      13 She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her
      hands.<BR />
      14 She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from
      afar.<BR />
      15 She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to
      her household, and a portion to her maidens.<BR />
      16 She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of
      her hands she planteth a vineyard.<BR />
      17 She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her
      arms.<BR />
      18 She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth
      not out by night.<BR />
      19 She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the
      distaff.<BR />
      20 She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth
      forth her hands to the needy.<BR />
      21 She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her
      household are clothed with scarlet.<BR />
      22 She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is
      silk and purple.<BR />
      23 Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the
      elders of the land.<BR />
      24 She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles
      unto the merchant.<BR />
      25 Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice
      in time to come.<BR />
      26 She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the
      law of kindness.<BR />
      27 She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth
      not the bread of idleness.<BR />
      28 Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also,
      and he praiseth her.<BR />
      29 Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them
      all.<BR />
      30 Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that
      feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.<BR />
      31 Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works
      praise her in the gates.</FONT></P>

      <P><B>Gradual. </B><I>Ps. </I>45 Full of grace are thy lips:

      forth, ride prosperously, and reign. Alleluia.<BR />
<BR />
      <I>After Septuagesima, instead of the </I>Alleluia, <I>and verse
      following, is said:<BR />
<BR />
      </I><B>TRACT</B>. Come, thou bride of Christ, receive the crown,
      which the Lord hath prepared for thee for ever. V. <I>Ps. </I>45.
      Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity: therefore
      God, even thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness
      above thy fellows. V. In thy comliness and in thy beauty go forth,
      ride prosperously, and reign.<BR />
<BR />
      <I>In Eastertide, instead of the Gradual, is said:<BR />
<BR />
      </I>Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>Ibid. </I>In thy comliness and
      in thy beauty go forth, ride prosperously, and reign. Alleluia.
      V. Because of the word of truth and meekness and righteousness:

      <P><B>GOSPEL. St Matthew 13:44-52<BR />
      </B><FONT COLOR="#000000">44 AT that time: Jesus spake this parable
      unto his disciples: The kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure
      hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and
      for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth
      that field.<BR />
      45 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man,
      seeking goodly pearls:<BR />
      46 Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and
      sold all that he had, and bought it.<BR />
      47 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was
      cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:<BR />
      48 Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down,
      and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.<BR />
      49 So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come
      forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,<BR />
      50 And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall
      be wailing and gnashing of teeth.<BR />
      51 Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things?
      They say unto him, Yea, Lord.<BR />
      52 Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed
      unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder,
      which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.<BR />

      because God hath blessed thee for ever, and world without end
      (Alleluia).</P>

      <P><B>SECRET.</B><BR />
      GRANT, O Lord, we pray thee, that like as we thy faithful people
      do acknowledge that in the time of our tribulation we have been
      succoured by the merits of thy Saints: so this oblation, which
      we here do offer and present unto thee in their honour, may be
      acceptable in thy sight. Through.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>COMMUNION.<BR />
      </B><I>Ibid. </I>Thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity:
      therefore God, even thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of
      gladness above thy fellows.<BR />

      O LORD, who hast vouchsafed to fed us thy household with thy
      heavenly gifts: mercifully grant, that we, who celebrate the
      feast of thy blessed Monica, may at all times be comforted by
      her intercession. Through.</P>
