        <b><font color="#7f0000" size="+1">MISSAL PROPERS:<br />
          THE TENTH SUNDAY AFTER TRINITY<br />
        </font></b>
      </center>
    </p>
    <p><b>INTROIT. <i>Cum clamarem. Ps. 55. </i></b><br />
      WHEN I called upon the Lord,
      he heard my voice, even from the battle that was against me:
      yea, even God that endureth for ever shall hear me, and bring
      them down: O cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall nourish
      thee. <i>Ps. ibid. </i>Hear my prayer, O Lord, and hide not thyself
      from my petition: take heed unto me, and hear me. V. Glory be.</p>
    <p><b>COLLECT.</b><br />
      LET thy merciful ears, O Lord, be open to the prayers of thy
      humble servants: and that they may obtain their petitions, make
      them to ask such things as shall please thee; through Jesus Christ
      our Lord. Amen.</p>
    <p><b>EPISTLE.<i> 1 Corinthians 12:1-11</i></b><br />
      1 BRETHREN: concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not
      have you ignorant.<br />
      2 Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb
      idols, even as ye were led.<br />
      3 Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by
      the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can
      say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.<br />
      4 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.<br />
      5 And there are differences of administrations, but the same
      Lord.<br />
      6 And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same
      God which worketh all in all.<br />
      7 But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to
      profit withal.<br />
      8 For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another
      the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;<br />
      9 To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of
      healing by the same Spirit;<br />
      10 To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to
      another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues;
      to another the interpretation of tongues:<br />
      11 But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing
      to every man severally as he will.</p>
    <p><b>GRADUAL. <i>Ps. 7. </i></b>Keep me, O Lord, as the apple
      of an eye: hide me under the shadow of thy wings. V. Let my sentence
      come forth from thy presence: and let thine eyes look upon the
      thing that is equal.<br />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <i>Ps. 65. </i>Thou, O God, art praised
      in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed in Jerusalem.
      Alleluia.</p>
    <p><b>GOSPEL. St. Luke 19:41-47</b><br />
      41 AT that time: When Jesus
      was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,<br />
      42 Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy
      day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are
      hid from thine eyes.<br />
      43 For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall
      cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee
      in on every side,<br />
      44 And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children
      within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon
      another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.<br />
      45 And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that
      sold therein, and them that bought;<br />
      46 Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of
      prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves.<br />
      47 And he taught daily in the temple.</p>
    <p><b>OFFERTORY. <i>Ps. </i>25<i>. </i></b>Unto thee, O Lord,
      will I lift up my soul: my God, I have put my trust in thee,
      O let me not be confounded: neither let mine enemies triumph
      over me: for all they that hop in thee shall not be ashamed.</p>
    <p><b>SECRET.<br />
      </b>O LORD, who hast instituted this sacrifice to be a remembrance
      of the effectual continuance of the work of our redemption: grant,
      we pray thee, that we may ever be enabled by thee to draw near
      in worthiness unto these thy mysteries. [Through.]</p>
    <p><b>COMMUNION. <i>Ps. 51.</i></b><i> </i>Thou shalt be pleased
      with the sacrifice of righteousness, with the burnt offerings
      and oblations upon thine altar, O Lord.</p>
    <p><b>POSTCOMMUNION.</b><br />
      GRANT, O Lord, we pray thee: that this holy Communion, which
      we have received, may cleanse us from all our sins, and bestow
      upon us unity and concord. [Through.]<br />
