      2 In those days : The children of Israel gathered themselves
      together against Moses and against Aaron. <BR>
      3 And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God
      that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD! <BR>
      4 And why have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into
      this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there? <BR>
      5 And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring
      us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs,
      or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to
      drink. <BR>
      6 And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly
      unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they
      fell upon their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto
      them. <BR>
      7 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <BR>
      8 Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou,
      and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their
      eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring
      forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation
      and their beasts drink. <BR>
      9 And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded
      him. <BR>
      10 And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before
      the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we
      fetch you water out of this rock? <BR>
      11 And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the
      rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation
      drank, and their beasts also. <BR>
      12 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed
      me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel,
      therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land
      which I have given them. <BR>
      13 This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel
      strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them. <BR>
<BR>
      <B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps</I>. 28. </B>My heart hath trusted in God,
      and I am helped: therefore my heart danceth for joy and in my
      song will I praise him. V. Unto thee will I cry, O Lord my strength
      : think no scorn of me: my God, go not far from me.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>TRACT. <I>Ps</I>. 103. </B>O Lord, deal not with us after
      our sins; nor reward us according to wickednesses. V. Ps. 79.
      Lord, remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and
      that soon: for we are come to great misery. V. <I>(Here genuflect.)</I>
      Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name, O
      Lord: O deliver us and be merciful unto our sins, for thy Name's
      sake.<BR>

      At that time : Jesus cometh to a city of Samaria, which is called
      Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son
      Joseph. <BR>
      6 Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied
      with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the
      sixth hour. <BR>
      7 There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith
      unto her, Give me to drink. <BR>
      8 (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)
<BR>
      9 Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou,
      being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria?
      for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. <BR>
      10 Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift
      of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou
      wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living
      water. <BR>
      11 The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with,
      and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living
      water? <BR>
      12 Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the
      well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?
<BR>
      13 Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this
      water shall thirst again: <BR>
      14 But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him
      shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall
      be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.
<BR>
      15 The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I
      thirst not, neither come hither to draw. <BR>
      16 Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.
<BR>
      17 The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said
      unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband: <BR>
      18 For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast
      is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly. <BR>
      19 The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a
      prophet. <BR>
      20 Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that
      in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. <BR>
      21 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh,
      when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem,
      worship the Father. <BR>
      22 Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for
      salvation is of the Jews. <BR>
      23 But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers
      shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father
      seeketh such to worship him. <BR>
      24 God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him
      in spirit and in truth. <BR>
      25 The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which
      is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.
<BR>
      26 Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he. <BR>
      27 And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked
      with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest
      thou with her? <BR>
      28 The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the
      city, and saith to the men, <BR>
      29 Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did:
      is not this the Christ? <BR>
      30 Then they went out of the city, and came unto him. <BR>
      31 In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master,
      eat. <BR>
      32 But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not
      of. <BR>
      33 Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man
      brought him aught to eat? <BR>
      34 Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that
      sent me, and to finish his work. <BR>
      35 Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest?
      behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields;
      for they are white already to harvest. <BR>
      36 And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto
      life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may
      rejoice together. <BR>
      37 And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.
<BR>
      38 I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other
      men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours. <BR>
      39 And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for
      the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that
      ever I did. <BR>
      40 So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him
      that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days. <BR>
      41 And many more believed because of his own word; <BR>
      42 And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy
      saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is
      indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world. <BR>
<BR>
      <B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps</I>. 5. </B>O hearken thou unto the voice
      of my calling, my King, and my God: for unto thee, O Lord, will
      I make my prayer.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>SECRET.</B><BR>
      Look favourably, O Lord, we pray thee, on the gifts which here
      we offer and present unto thee : humbly beseeching thee, that
      they may be an acceptable offering in thy sight, and profitable
      unto us for our salvation. Through.<BR>
      <B><BR>
      COMMUNION. <I>St. John</I> 4. </B>Whosoever drinketh of the water
      that I shall give him, saith the Lord, it shall be in him a well
      of water, springing up into everlasting life.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR>
      Grant, we beseech thee, O Lord, that this holy Sacrament, whereof
      we have been made partakers, may cleanse us from all our sins
      : and bring us in the end unto thy heavenly kingdom. Through.<BR>

      <I>Over the people.</I> Let us pray. Bow down before the Lord.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR>
      Grant, we beseech thee, Almighty God: that we, who put our trust
      and confidence in thy mercy, may by thee be enabled to overcome
      all adversities. Through.</P>
