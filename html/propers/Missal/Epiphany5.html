      INTROIT. <I>Adorate Deum. Ps. </I>97.<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>All ye Angels of God,
      fall down, and worship before him: Sion heard of it, and rejoiced:
      and the daughters of Judah were glad. Ps. <I>ibid.</I> The Lord
      is King, the earth may be glad thereof. yea, the multitude of
      the isles may be glad thereof. V. Glory be.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>COLLECT</B>.<BR />
      O Lord, we beseech thee to keep thy Church and household continually
      in thy true religion: that they who do lean only upon the hope
      of thy heavenly grace, may evermore be defended by thy mighty
      power. [Through]<BR />
<BR />
      <B>EPISTLE. <I>Colossians </I>3:12-17</B><BR />
      12 Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels
      of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;
<BR />
      13 Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any
      man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so
      also do ye. <BR />
      14 And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond
      of perfectness. <BR />
      15 And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which
      also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful. <BR />
      16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom;
      teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and
      spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.
<BR />
      17 And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of
      the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>GRADUAL</B>.<B> <I>Ps</I>. 102.</B> The heathen shall fear
      thy Name, O Lord: and all the kings of the earth thy majesty.
      V. When the Lord shall build up Sion: and when his glory shall
      appear. <BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V.<I> Ps.</I> 97. The Lord is King, the earth
      may be glad thereof; yea, the multitude of the isles may be glad
      thereof. Alleluia.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>St. Matthew </I>13:24-30<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>24 AT that time; Jesus
      spake this parable unto the multitudes: The kingdom of heaven
      is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: <BR />
      25 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among
      the wheat, and went his way. <BR />
      26 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit,
      then appeared the tares also. <BR />
      27 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him,
      Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then
      hath it tares? <BR />
      28 He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said
      unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? <BR />
      29 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root
      up also the wheat with them. <BR />
      30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time
      of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first
      the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather
      the wheat into my barn. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps. </I>118. </B>The right hand of the Lord
      hath the pre-eminence, the right hand of the Lord bringeth mighty
      things to pass: I shall not die, but live, and declare the works
      of the Lord.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>SECRET</B>.<BR />
      Accept, O Lord, we pray thee, this sacrifice which we offer unto
      thee for the propitiation of our sins: that we, which have gone
      astray by reason of our frailty, may be pardoned by thy mercy
      and guided by thy power. [Through.]<BR />
<BR />
      <B>COMMUNION</B>. <B><I>St. Luke </I>4.</B> All wondered at the
      gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION</B>.<BR />
      Grant, we beseech thee, Almighty God; that as in these holy mysteries
      we have received the token of our redemption, so we may effectually
      be brought to the fulfilment of the same. [Through.]<BR />
