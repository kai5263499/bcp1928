      O LORD, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be ashamed,
      and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because
      they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of living waters.<BR>
      14 Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall
      be saved: for thou art my praise.<BR>
      15 Behold, they say unto me, Where is the word of the LORD? let
      it come now.<BR>
      16 As for me, I have not hastened from being a pastor to follow
      thee: neither have I desired the woeful day; thou knowest: that
      which came out of my lips was right before thee.<BR>
      17 Be not a terror unto me: thou art my hope in the day of evil.<BR>
      18 Let them be confounded that persecute me, but let not me be
      confounded: let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed:
      bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double
      destruction.</FONT></P>

      <I>Ps. 35</I>. Their communing is not for peace: but they imagine

      the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What
      do we? for this man doeth many miracles.<BR>
      48 If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and
      the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.<BR>
      49 And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that
      same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,<BR>
      50 Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should
      die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.<BR>
      51 And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that
      year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;<BR>
      52 And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather
      together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.<BR>
      53 Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to
      put him to death.<BR>
      54 Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but
      went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city
      called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.</FONT></P>
