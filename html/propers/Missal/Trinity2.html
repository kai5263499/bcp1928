    <p><br />
        <b>INTROIT. <i>Factus est Dominus. Ps. 18</i></b><br />
      THE LORD was my upholder,
      he brought me forth also into a place of liberty: he brought
      me forth, even because he had a favour unto me. <i>Ps. Ibid.</i> I will love thee, O Lord, my strength: the Lord is my stony rock,
      my defence, and my Saviour. V. Glory be.</p>
    <p><b>COLLECT.<br />
      </b>O LORD, who never failest to help and govern those whom thou
      dost bring up in thy stedfast fear and love; Keep us, we beseech
      thee, under the protection of thy good providence, and make us
      to have a perpetual fear and love of thy holy Name; through Jesus
      Christ our Lord. AMEN.</p>
    <p><b>EPISTLE.<i> 1 John 3:13-24</i></b><br />
      13 Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you. <br />
      14 We know that we have passed from death unto life, because
      we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth
      in death. <br />
      15 Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that
      no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. <br />
      16 Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his
      life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. <br />
      17 But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have
      need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how
      dwelleth the love of God in him? <br />
      18 My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue;
      but in deed and in truth. <br />
      19 And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure
      our hearts before him. <br />
      20 For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart,
      and knoweth all things. <br />
      21 Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence
      toward God. <br />
      22 And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep
      his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his
      sight. <br />
      23 And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the
      name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave
      us commandment. <br />
      24 And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and
      he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit
      which he hath given us.</p>
    <p><b>GRADUAL. <i>Ps. 120 </i></b>When I was in trouble I called
      upon the Lord: and he heard me. V. Deliver my soul, O Lord, from
      lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue. <br />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. Ps. 7. O Lord my God, in thee have I put
      my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver
      me. Alleluia.</p>
    <p><b>GOSPEL. <i>St. Luke 14:16-24<br />
      </i></b>16 AT that time: Jesus spake unto the Pharisees this
      parable: A certain man made a great supper, and bade many: <br />
      17 And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were
      bidden, Come; for all things are now ready. <br />
      18 And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first
      said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs
      go and see it: I pray thee have me excused. <br />
      19 And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go
      to prove them: I pray thee have me excused. <br />
      20 And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot
      come. <br />
      21 So that servant came, and showed his lord these things. Then
      the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out
      quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in
      hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind. <br />
      22 And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded,
      and yet there is room. <br />
      23 And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways
      and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be
      filled. <br />
      24 For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden
      shall taste of my supper.</p>
    <p><b>OFFERTORY. <i>Ps. 6. </i></b>Turn thee, O Lord, and deliver
      my soul: O save me for thy mercy's sake.</p>
    <p><b>SECRET.</b><br />
      GRANT, O Lord, that the oblation which we consecrate unto thy
      Name may cleanse us from all our sins: and daily renew us to
      the attainment of heavenly life. [Through.]</p>
    <p><b>COMMUNION. <i>Ps. 13.</i></b> I will sing of the Lord,
      because he hath dealt so lovingly with me: yea, I will praise
      the Name of the Lord Most Highest.</p>
    <p><b>POSTCOMMUNION.<br />
      </b>O LORD, who hast here vouchsafed unto us to be partakers
      of thy bounty: grant, we beseech thee, that we may so continue
      to draw near unto the same, that, growing more and more in grace,
      we may attain in the end to everlasting life. [Through.]<br />
