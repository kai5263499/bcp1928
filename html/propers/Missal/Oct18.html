      <P><B>INTROIT. <I>Mihi autem nimis. Ps.</I> 139</B><BR />
      Right dear are thy friends unto me, O God, and held in highest
      honour: their rule and governance is exceeding stedfast. <I>Ps.
      ibid. </I>Lord, thou hast searched me out and known me: thou
      knowest my downsitting and mine uprising. V. Glory be.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      ALMIGHTY GOD, who didst inspire thy servant Saint Luke the Physician,
      to set forth in the Gospel the love and healing power of thy
      Son; Manifest in thy Church the like power and love, to the healing
      of our bodies and our souls; through the same thy Son Jesus Christ
      our Lord. [Who.]<BR />
      </P>

      <P><B>EPISTLE. <I>2 Timothy 4:5-15</I></B><BR />
      5 DEARLY BELOVED: watch thou in all things, endure afflictions,
      do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.
<BR />
      6 For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure
      is at hand. <BR />
      7 I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have
      kept the faith: <BR />
      8 Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,
      which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day:
      and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.
<BR />
      9 Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me: <BR />
      10 For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world,
      and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus
      unto Dalmatia. <BR />
      11 Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee:
      for he is profitable to me for the ministry. <BR />
      12 And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus. <BR />
      13 The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest,
      bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments.
<BR />
      14 Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward
      him according to his works: <BR />
      15 Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our
      words. <BR />
      </P>

      <P><B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps. 19<BR />
      </I></B>Their sound is gone out into all lands: and their words
      into the ends of the world. V. The heaven declare the glory of
      God: and the firmament sheweth his handy-work. <BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>St. John 15.</I> I have chosen you,
      and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit: and
      that your fruit should remain. Alleluia.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><B>GOSPEL. <I>St Luke 10:1-7a<BR />
      </I></B>1 After these things the Lord appointed other seventy
      also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city
      and place, whither he himself would come. <BR />
      2 Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but
      the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest,
      that he would send forth labourers into his harvest. <BR />
      3 Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.
<BR />
      4 Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man
      by the way. <BR />
      5 And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to
      this house. <BR />
      6 And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon
      it: if not, it shall turn to you again. <BR />
      7 And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things
      as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire.</P>

      <P><B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps. </I>139. </B>Right dear are thy friends
      unto me, O God, and held in highest honour: their rule and governance
      is exceeding stedfast. <BR />
      </P>

      <P><B>SECRET.<BR />
      </B>GRANT, O Lord, we pray thee, that by thy heavenly gifts we
      may be enabled to serve thee in perfect freedom: that, by the
      intercession of thy blessed Evangelist Saint Luke, the oblations
      which we offer may effectually work in us for the healing of
      our souls, and for the attainment of everlasting glory. Through.
<BR />
<BR />
      <B>COMMUNION. <I>St. Matthew </I>19. 28.</B><I> </I>Ye which
      have followed me shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve
      tribes of Israel. <BR />
      </P>

      <P><B>POSTCOMMUNION.<BR />
      </B>GRANT, we beseech thee, Almighty God: that, by the prayers
      of thy blessed Evangelist Saint Luke; the gifts which we have
      received from thy holy altar may sanctify our souls to their
      salvation. Through.</P>
