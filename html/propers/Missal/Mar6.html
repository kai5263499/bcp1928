      ungodly laid wait for me to destroy me: but I will consider thy
      testimonies, O Lord: I see that all things come to an end: but
      thy commandment is exceeding broad (alleluia). <I>Ps. ibid. </I>Blessed

      O GOD, who among the manifold works of thine almighty power has
      bestowed even upon the weakness of women strength to win the
      victory of martyrdom: grant, we beseech thee, that we, who on
      this day recall the heavenly birth of blessed Perpetua and Felicity,
      thy martyrs, may so follow in their footsteps, that we may likewise
      attain unto the. Through.</P>

      <B>EPISTLE. <FONT COLOR="#000000">Ecclesiasticus 51:1-8<BR />
      </FONT></B>1 I will thank thee, O Lord and King, and praise thee,
      O God my Saviour: I do give praise unto thy name:<BR />
      2 For thou art my defender and helper, and has preserved my body
      from destruction, and from the snare of the slanderous tongue,
      and from the lips that forge lies, and has been mine helper against
      mine adversaries:<BR />
      3 And hast delivered me, according to the multitude of they mercies
      and greatness of thy name, from the teeth of them that were ready
      to devour me, and out of the hands of such as sought after my
      life, and from the manifold afflictions which I had;<BR />
      4 From the choking of fire on every side, and from the midst
      of the fire which I kindled not;<BR />
      5 From the depth of the belly of hell, from an unclean tongue,
      and from lying words.<BR />
      6 By an accusation to the king from an unrighteous tongue my
      soul drew near even unto death, my life was near to the hell
      beneath.<BR />
      7 They compassed me on every side, and there was no man to help
      me: I looked for the succour of men, but there was none.<BR />
      8 Then thought I upon thy mercy, O Lord, and upon thy acts of
      old, how thou deliverest such as wait for thee, and savest them
      out of the hands of the enemies.<BR />

      AT that time, Jesus spake this parable unto his disciples: the
      kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which
      when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and
      selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.<BR />
      45 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man,
      seeking goodly pearls:<BR />
      46 Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and
      sold all that he had, and bought it.<BR />
      47 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was
      cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:<BR />
      48 Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down,
      and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.<BR />
      49 So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come
      forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,<BR />
      50 And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall
      be wailing and gnashing of teeth.<BR />
      51 Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things?
      They say unto him, Yea, Lord.<BR />
      52 Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed
      unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder,
      which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.</P>

      <P><B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps. </I>45.</B> Full of grace are thy lips:
      because God hath blessed thee for ever, and world without end
      (alleluia).</P>

      <P><B>SECRET.</B><BR />
      O LORD, who seest that we do trust for our deliverance in the
      advocacy of blessed Perpetua and Felicity, thy Martyrs: grant,
      we beseech thee, that the gifts which we offer unto thee of this
      their festival may be acceptable in thy sight. Through.</P>

      <P><B>COMMUNION. <I>Ps. </I>119.</B> Princes have persecuted
      me without a cause, but my hearth standeth in awe of thy word:
      I am as glad of thy word, as one that findeth great spoils (alleluia).</P>

      <P><B>POSTCOMMUNION. </B><BR />
      O LORD, who hast fulfilled us with gladness in these wondrous
      mysteries: grant, we pray thee; that by the intercession of thy
      blessed Martyrs Perpetua and Felicity, we which have offered
      unto thee our temporal worship may in our ouls receive the benefits
      of the same. Though.</P>
