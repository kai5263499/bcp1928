      RIGHTEOUS art thou, O Lord,
      and true is thy judgement: O deal with thy servant according
      unto thy loving mercy. <i>Ps</i> 119<i> </i>Blessed are those
      that are undefiled in the way: and walk in the law of the Lord.
      V. Glory be.<br />

    <p><b>COLLECT.<br />
      </b>LORD, we pray thee that thy grace may always prevent and

    <p><b>EPISTLE. <i>Ephesians 4:1-6<br />
      </i></b>1 I THEREFORE, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you
      that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,<br />
      2 With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing
      one another in love;<br />
      3 Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of
      peace.<br />
      4 There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in
      one hope of your calling;<br />
      5 One Lord, one faith, one baptism,<br />
      6 One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all,
      and in you all.<br />
        <b><br />
          GRADUAL. <i>Ps. </i>33.</b><i> </i>Blessed are the people, whose
      God is the Lord JEHOVAH: and blessed are the folk that he hath
      chosen to him to be his inheritance. V. By the word of the LORD
      were the heavens made: and all the hosts of them by the breath
      of his mouth.<br />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <i>Ps. </i>102<i> </i>Hear my prayer,
      O Lord, and let my crying come unto thee. Alleluia.<br />

    <p><b>GOSPEL. <i>St Luke 14:1-11<br />
      </i></b> 1 And it came to pass, as
      he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread
      on the sabbath day, that they watched him.<br />
      2 And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the
      dropsy.<br />
      3 And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying,
      Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?<br />
      4 And they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him,
      and let him go;<br />
      5 And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or
      an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out
      on the sabbath day?<br />
      6 And they could not answer him again to these things.<br />
      7 And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when
      he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them,<br />
      8 When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down
      in the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be
      bidden of him;<br />
      9 And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this
      man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room.<br />
      10 But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room;
      that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend,
      go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of
      them that sit at meat with thee.<br />
      11 For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that
      humbleth himself shall be exalted.<br />
        <b><br />
          OFFERTORY<i>. Dan. 9:17,19 </i></b>I, Daniel, prayed unto the
      Lord my God, and said: Hear, O Lord, the prayer of thy servant:
      cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary: and mercifully behold
      this thy people, which is called by thy Name, O God.<br />
        <br />
    </p>
    <p><b>SECRET.</b><br />
      CLEANSE us, O Lord, we pray thee, by the effectual working of
      this our sacrifice: and so accomplish in us the work of thy mercy,
      that we may be found worthy to be made partakers of the same.
      Through.<br />
        <br />
        <b>COMMUNION. Ps. 76. </b>Promise unto the LORD your God, and
      keep it, all ye that are round about him: bring presents unto
      him that ought to be feared: he shall refrain the spirit of princes:
      and is wonderful among the kings of the earth.<br />
    </p>
    <p><b>POSTCOMMUNION.<br />
      </b>WE beseech thee, O Lord, that the operation of thy heavenly
      bounty may in such wise prevail upon us both in body and soul;
      that the desires of our hearts being done away; we may in all
      things be governed by the effectual working of the same. [Through.]
