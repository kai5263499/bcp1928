      me, O Lord, and be merciful unto me : my foot standeth right,
      I will praise the Lord in the congregation.&nbsp; Ps. ibid.&nbsp;
      Be thou my judge, O Lord, for I have walked innocently : my trust
      hath been also in the Lord, therefore I shall not fail.&nbsp;
      V. Glory be.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR>
      GRANT, we beseech thee, Almighty God: that, like as we thy family
      do abstain from food to the mortifying of the flesh; so we may
      likewise fast from sin to the following after righteousness.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Through.<BR>

      <I>Seasonal Prayers as on Ash Wednesday.</I><BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>FOR THE EPISTLE. <I>Daniel</I> 9:15-19</B><BR>
      15 IN those days: Daniel prayed unto the Lord, saying: O Lord
      our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of
      Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at
      this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly. <BR>
      16 O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee,
      let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem,
      thy holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities
      of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach
      to all that are about us. <BR>
      17 Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant,
      and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary
      that is desolate, for the Lord's sake. <BR>
      18 O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and
      behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name:
      for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses,
      but for thy great mercies. <BR>
      19 O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer
      not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people
      are called by thy name, O Lord, our God.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>GRADUAL.&nbsp; <I>Ps</I>. 70.&nbsp;</B>&nbsp; Thou art my
      helper and redeemer : O Lord, make no long tarrying.&nbsp; V.
      Let mine enemies be ashamed and confounded, that seek after my
      soul.&nbsp;<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>TRACT. <I>Ps</I>. 103. </B>O Lord, deal not with us after
      our sins; nor reward us according to wickednesses. V. Ps. 79.
      Lord, remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and
      that soon: for we are come to great misery. V. <I>(Here genuflect.)</I>
      Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name, O
      Lord: O deliver us and be merciful unto our sins, for thy Name's
      sake.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>St. John </I>8:21-29<BR>
      <FONT SIZE="-1"><IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></FONT></B>&nbsp;21
      AT that time; Jesus said unto the multitude of the Jews: I go
      my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither
      I go, ye cannot come. <BR>
      22 Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith,
      Whither I go, ye cannot come. <BR>
      23 And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above:
      ye are of this world; I am not of this world. <BR>
      24 I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins:
      for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.
<BR>
      25 Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto
      them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.
<BR>
      26 I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that
      sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which
      I have heard of him. <BR>
      27 They understood not that he spake to them of the Father. <BR>
      28 Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son
      of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing
      of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.
<BR>
      29 And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me
      alone; for I do always those things that please him.</P>

      <P><BR>
      <B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps</I>. 16.&nbsp;</B> I will thank the Lord
      for giving me warning: I have set God always before me: for he
      is on my right hand, therefore I shall not fail.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>SECRET.</B><BR>
      Grant, we beseech thee, O Lord, that this our sacrifice of atonement
      and thanksgiving may render us in all things worthy of thy succour.&nbsp;&nbsp;Through.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>COMMUNION.&nbsp; <I>Ps</I>. 8. </B>O Lord our Governour, how
      excellent is thy Name in all the world.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION</B><BR>
      &nbsp;Grant, O Lord, that this holy Communion may cleanse us
      from every guilty stain: and obtain for us thy healing unto life
      eternal.&nbsp; Through.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <I>Over the people.&nbsp;</I> Let us pray.&nbsp; Bow down before
      the Lord.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR>
      Assist us mercifully, O Lord, in these our supplications: that
      we, whom thou dost suffer to put our trust and confidence in
      thy mercy, may of thy goodness obtain the wonted effects of thy
      compassion.&nbsp;&nbsp; Through.<FONT SIZE="+1"><BR>
