        <b>INTROIT</b>.<i> Miserere mihi. Ps.</i> 86<br />
      BE MERCIFUL unto me O Lord,
      for I will call daily upon thee: for thou, O Lord, art good and
      gracious, and of great mercy unto all them that call upon thee. <i>Ps. ibid </i>Bow down thine ear, O Lord, and hear me: for
      I am poor and in misery. V. Glory be.<br />
    </p>
    <p><b>COLLECT.</b><br />
      O LORD, we beseech thee, let thy continual pity cleanse and defend
      thy Church: and, because it cannot continue in safety without
      thy succour, preserve it evermore by thy help and goodness. Through
      Jesus Christ our Lord.<br />
    </p>
    <p><b>EPISTLE. <i>Ephesians 3:13-21</i></b><br />
      13 I DESIRE that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which
      is your glory.<br />
      14 For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord
      Jesus Christ,<br />
      15 Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,<br />
      16 That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory,
      to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;<br />
      17 That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being
      rooted and grounded in love,<br />
      18 May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth,
      and length, and depth, and height;<br />
      19 And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that
      ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.<br />
      20 Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above
      all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh
      in us,<br />
      21 Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout
      all ages, world without end. Amen.<br />
    </p>
    <p><b>GRADUAL. <i>Ps. </i>102. </b>The heathen shall fear thy
      Name, O Lord, and all the kings of the earth thy majesty. V.
      When the Lord shall build up Sion: and when his glory shall appear.<br />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <i>Ps. </i>98 O sing unto the Lord a new
      song: for he hath done marvelous things. Alleluia.<br />

    <p><b>GOSPEL. <i>Saint Luke 7:11-17</i></b><br />
      11 AND it came to pass the
      day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of
      his disciples went with him, and much people.<br />
      12 Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there
      was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she
      was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.<br />
      13 And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said
      unto her, Weep not.<br />
      14 And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood
      still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.<br />
      15 And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered
      him to his mother.<br />
      16 And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying,
      That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath
      visited his people.<br />
      17 And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and
      throughout all the region round about.<br />

    <p><b>OFFERTORY. <i>Ps. </i>40.</b><i> </i>Make haste, O Lord,
      to help me: let them be ashamed and confounded together, that
      seek after my soul, to destroy it: make haste, O Lord, to help
      me.</p>
    <p><b>SECRET</b>.<br />
      GRANT, O Lord, we pray thee, that by the protection of thy holy
      sacraments, we may ever be defended against all the assaults
      off the devil. Through.<br />
        <br />
        <b>COMMUNION. <i>Ps</i>. 71.</b> O Lord, I will make mention
      of thy righteousness only: thou, O God, hast taught me from my
      youth up until now: forsake me not, O God, in mine old age, when
      I am grey-headed.<br />
    </p>
    <p><b>POSTCOMMUNION.</b><br />
      WE beseech thee, O Lord, that the operation of thy heavenly bounty
      may in such wise prevail upon us both in body and soul: that
      the desires of our hearts being done away; we may in all things
      be governed by the effectual working of the same. Through.</p>
