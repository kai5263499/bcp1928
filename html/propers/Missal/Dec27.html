      he opened his mouth: and the Lord filled him with the spirit
      of wisdom and understanding: he clothed him with a robe of glory.
      <I>Ps. 92.</I> It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord:
      and to sing praises unto thy Name, O Most Highest. V. Glory be.</P>

      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      Merciful Lord, we beseech thee to cast thy bright beams of light
      upon thy Church: that it being illumined by the doctrine of thy
      blessed Apostle and Evangelist Saint John may so walk in the
      light of thy truth, that it may at length attain to life everlasting.
      Through Jesus Christ our Lord. [Who.]</P>

      <P><B>COLLECT OF THE NATIVITY </B><I>as on Saint Stephen's Day.<BR />
<BR />
      </I><B>EPISTLE . <I>I St. John </I>I.<BR />
      </B>1 That which was from the beginning, which we have heard,
      which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon,
      and our hands have handled, of the Word of life; <BR />
      2 (For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear
      witness, and show unto you that eternal life, which was with
      the Father, and was manifested unto us;) <BR />
      3 That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that
      ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship
      is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. <BR />
      4 And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.
<BR />
      5 This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare
      unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
<BR />
      6 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness,
      we lie, and do not the truth: <BR />
      7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have
      fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his
      Son cleanseth us from all sin. <BR />
      8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the
      truth is not in us. <BR />
      9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive
      us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. <BR />
      10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and
      his word is not in us. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>GRADUAL. <I>St. John </I>21<I>. </I></B>Then went this saying
      abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die:
      yet Jesus said not unto him; He shall not die. V. But: If I will
      that he tarry till I come: follow thou me.<BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. This is the disciple which testifieth
      of these things: and we know that his testimony is true. Alleluia.</P>

      <P>&para; <I>In Votive Masses after Septuagesima, instead of
      the </I>Alleluia <I>and verse following, is said the Tract </I>Blessed
      is the man <I>as in the Common of Doctors. But in Eastertide,
      instead of the Gradual, is said the </I>Alleluia <I>as above,
      and then the verse, Ps. </I>92. The righteous shall flourish
      like a palm-tree: and shall spread abroad like a cedar in Libanus.
      Alleluia.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>St. John </I>21:19-25<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>19 Jesus saith unto Peter,
      Follow me. <BR />
      20 Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved
      following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said,
      Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee? <BR />
      21 Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this
      man do? <BR />
      22 Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come,
      what is that to thee? follow thou me. <BR />
      23 Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that
      disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall
      not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that
      to thee? <BR />
      24 This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and
      wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true. <BR />
      25 And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the
      which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even
      the world itself could not contain the books that should be written.
      <I>The Creed is said.<BR />
<BR />
      </I><B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps. </I>92<I>. </I></B>The righteous shall
      flourish like a palm-tree; and shall spread abroad like a cedar
      in Libanus.<BR />

      <B>SECRET.</B><BR />
      O Lord who seest that we do trust for our deliverance in the
      advocacy of thy blessed Apostle Saint John: grant, we beseech
      thee; that the gifts which we offer unto thee on this his festival
      may be acceptable in thy sight. Through.</P>
