      O GOD, who in a wonderful Sacrament hast ordained unto us a Memory
      of thy Passion: grant us, we beseech thee, so to worship the
      sacred mysteries of thy Body and Blood, that we may ever know
      within ourselves the fruits of thy redemption. Who livest and
      reignest with the Father.</P>

      <B>The Epistle. <FONT COLOR="#000000">1 Corinthians 11:23-29</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>
      23 BRETHREN: I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered
      unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was
      betrayed took bread:<BR>
      24 And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take,
      eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance
      of me.<BR>
      25 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped,
      saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye,
      as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.<BR>
      26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye
      do show the Lord's death till he come.<BR>
      27 Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup
      of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood
      of the Lord.<BR>
      28 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that
      bread, and drink of that cup.<BR>
      29 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh
      damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.</FONT></P>

      <P>Laud, O Sion, thy Salvation,<BR>
      Laud with hymns of exaltation<BR>
      Christ, thy King and Shepherd true:<BR>
<BR>
      Spend thyself, his honour raising,<BR>
      Who surpasseth all thy praising;<BR>
      Never canst thou reach his due.<BR>
<BR>
      Sing to-day, the mystery shewing<BR>
      Of the living, life-bestowing<BR>
      Bread from heaven before thee set;<BR>
<BR>
      E'en the same of old provided,<BR>
      Where the Twelve, divinely guided,<BR>
      At the holy Table met.<BR>
<BR>
      Full and clear ring out thy chanting,<BR>
      Joy nor sweetest grace be wanting<BR>
      To thy heart and soul today;<BR>
<BR>
      When we gather up the measure<BR>
      Of that Supper and its treasure,<BR>
      Keeping feast in glad array.<BR>
<BR>
      Lo, the new King's Table gracing,<BR>
      This new Passover of blessing<BR>
      Hath fulfilled the elder rite:<BR>
<BR>
      Now the new the old effaceth,<BR>
      Truth revealed the shadow chaseth,<BR>
      Day is breaking on the night.<BR>
<BR>
      What he did at Supper seated,<BR>
      Christ ordained to be repeated<BR>
      His memorial ne'er to cease:<BR>
<BR>
      And, His word for guidance taking,<BR>
      Bread and wine we hallow, making<BR>
      Thus our sacrifice of peace.<BR>
<BR>
      This the truth to Christians given -<BR>
      Bread becomes His Flesh from heaven,<BR>
      Wine becomes His Holy Blood.<BR>
<BR>
      Doth it pass thy comprehending?<BR>
      Yet by faith, thy sight transcending,<BR>
      Wondrous things are understood.<BR>
<BR>
      Yea, beneath these signs are hidden<BR>
      Glorious things to sight forbidden:<BR>
      Look not on the outward sign.<BR>
<BR>
      Wine is poured and Bread is broken,<BR>
      But in either sacred token<BR>
      Christ is here by power divine.<BR>
<BR>
      Whoso of this Food partaketh,<BR>
      Rendeth not the Lord nor breaketh:<BR>
      Christ is whole to all that taste.<BR>
<BR>
      Thousands are, as one, receivers;<BR>
      One as thousands of believers,<BR>
      Takes the Food that cannot waste.<BR>
<BR>
      Good and evil men are sharing<BR>
      One repast, a doom preparing<BR>
      Varied as the heart of man;<BR>
<BR>
      Doom of life or death awarded,<BR>
      As their days shall be recorded<BR>
      Which from one beginning ran.<BR>
<BR>
      When the Sacrament is broken,<BR>
      Doubt not in each severed token,<BR>
      Hallowed by the word once spoken,<BR>
      Resteth all the true content:<BR>
<BR>
      Nought the precious Gift divideth,<BR>
      Breaking but the sign betideth,<BR>
      He himself the same abideth,<BR>
      Nothing of His fulness spent.<BR>
<BR>
      Lo! the Angel's Food is given<BR>
      To the pilgrim who hath striven;<BR>
      See the children's Bread from heaven,<BR>
      Which to dogs may not be cast;<BR>
<BR>
      Truth the ancient types fulfilling;<BR>
      Isaac bound, a victim willing;<BR>
      Paschal lamb, its life-blood spilling;<BR>
      Manna sent in ages past.<BR>
<BR>
      O true Bread, good Shepherd, tend us,<BR>
      Jesu of thy love befriend us,<BR>
      Thou refresh us, thou defend us,<BR>
      Thine eternal goodness send us<BR>
      In the land of life to see;<BR>
<BR>
      Thou who all things canst and knowest,<BR>
      Who on earth such Food bestowest,<BR>
      Grant us with thy Saints though lowest,<BR>
      Where the heavenly Feast thou shewest,<BR>
      Fellow-heirs and guests to be.<BR>
<BR>
      Amen. Alleluia.<BR>

      <P><B>The Gospel. St John 6:55-58</B><BR>
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> 55 AT that time: Jesus said
      unto the multitude of the Jews: my flesh is meat indeed, and
      my blood is drink indeed.<BR>
      56 He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in
      me, and I in him.<BR>
      57 As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father:
      so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.<BR>
      58 This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your
      fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread
      shall live for ever.</P>

      <P><B>OFFERTORY. </B><I>Lev. </I>21. The priests of the Lord
      do offer the offerings of the Lord made by fire and the Bread
      of their God: therefore they shall be holy unto their God, and
      not profane the Name of their God. (<I>In Eastertide and Corpus
      Christi Tide: </I>Alleluia)</P>

      <P><B>SECRET.<BR>
      </B>We beseech thee, O Lord, that like as we in these our oblations
      do shew forth in a mystery the unity and concord of thy Church:
      so thou wouldest ever mercifully bestow upon her these thy blessings.
      Through.</P>

      <P><B>COMMUNION. </B>I <I>Cor </I>11. As often as ye do eat of
      this Bread, and drink of this Cup, ye do shew the Lord's death
      till he come: wherefore, whosoever shall eat of this Bread, and
      drink of this Cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of
      the Body and Blood of the Lord. (<I>In Eastertide and Corpus
      Christi Tide: </I>Alleluia.)</P>

      <P><B>POSTCOMMUNION.<BR>
      </B>Grant, we beseech thee, O Lord: that we who in these outward
      tokens have been made partakers of thy most precious Body and
      Blood; may after this life be replenished with the fruition of
      thy glorious Godhead. Who livest and reignest with the Father.</P>
