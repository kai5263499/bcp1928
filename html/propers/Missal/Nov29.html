      <P><B>INTROIT. <I>Dominus secus mare. St. Matt. </I>4.</B><BR />
      JESUS our Lord walking by the sea of Galilee saw two brethren,
      Peter and Andrew, and he called them saying: Follow me; and I
      will make you fishers of men. <I>Ps. </I>19. The heavens declare
      the glory of God: and the firmament sheweth his handy-work. V.
      Glory be.</P>

      <P><BR />
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      GRANT, we beseech thee, Almighty God: that as we do prevent the
      festival of thy holy Apostle Saint Andrew, so he may implore
      thy mercy for us; that we , being delivered from all our iniquities,
      may likewise be defended against all adversities. Through.</P>

      <P><BR />
      <B>For</B> <B>The Epistle. <FONT COLOR="#000000">Ecclesiasticus
      44:22-45:7<BR />
      </FONT></B>2 The blessing of the Lord was upon the head of the
      righteous. Therefore the Lord gave him an heritage, and divided
      his portions; among the twelve tribes did he part them.<BR />
      1 And he brought out of him a merciful man, which found favour
      in the sight of all flesh, even Moses, beloved of God and men,
      whose memorial is blessed.<BR />
      2 He made him like to the glorious saints, and magnified him,
      so that his enemies stood in fear of him.<BR />
      3 By his words he caused the wonders to cease, and he made him
      glorious in the sight of kings, and gave him a commandment for
      his people, and shewed him part of his glory.<BR />
      4 He sanctified him in his faithfulness and meekness, and chose
      him out of all men.<BR />
      5 He made him to hear his voice, and brought him into the dark
      cloud, and gave him commandments before his face, even the law
      of life and knowledge, that he might teach Jacob his covenants,
      and Israel his judgments.<BR />
      6 He exalted Aaron, an holy man like unto him, even his brother,
      of the tribe of Levi.<BR />
      7 An everlasting covenant he made with him and gave him the priesthood
      among the people; he beautified him with comely ornaments, and
      clothed him with a robe of glory.</P>

      <P><B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps. </I>139. </B>Right dear are thy friends,
      O God, and held in highest honour: their rule and governance
      is exceeding stedfast. V. If I should count them: they are more
      in number than the sand of the sea.</P>

      <P><B>The Gospel. St John 1:35-51<BR />
      </B><FONT COLOR="#000000">35 AT that time: John stood, and two
      of his disciples;<BR />
      36 And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the
      Lamb of God!<BR />
      37 And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.<BR />
      38 Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto
      them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say,
      being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?<BR />
      39 He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where
      he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth
      hour.<BR />
      40 One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was
      Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.<BR />
      41 He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him,
      We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.<BR />
      42 And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he
      said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas,
      which is by interpretation, A stone.<BR />
      43 The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth
      Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.<BR />
      44 Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.<BR />
      45 Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found
      him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus
      of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.<BR />
      46 And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come
      out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.<BR />
      47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold
      an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!<BR />
      48 Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered
      and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou
      wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.<BR />
      49 Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the
      Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.<BR />
      50 Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee,
      I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see
      greater things than these.<BR />
      51 And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter
      ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and
      descending upon the Son of man.</FONT></P>

      <P><B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps. </I>8. </B>Thou hast crowned him with
      glory and worship: thou hast made him to have dominion of the
      works of thy hands, O Lord.</P>

      <P><B>SECRET</B>.<BR />
      GRANT, O Lord, that this oblation, which we, remembering the
      festival of thy blessed Apostle Saint Andrew, do offer to be
      hallowed unto thee, may likewise avail to the cleansing of our
      souls from all evil. Through.</P>

      <P><B>COMMUNION. <I>St. John </I>1:41. </B>Andrew saith unto
      his brother Simon: We have found the Messias, which is, being
      interpreted, the Christ: and he brought him to Jesus.</P>

      <P><B>POSTCOMMUNION</B>.<BR />
      O LORD, who hast vouchsafed to feed us with these holy sacraments,
      we humbly pray thee: that, at the intercession of thy holy Apostle
      Saint Andrew, the mysteries which we have offered in remembrance
      of his glorious passion may be profitable unto us for the healing
      of our souls. Through.</P>
