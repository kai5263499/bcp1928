      10 In those days: the Lord spake unto Moses, saying: Speak unto
      all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying: I am
      the LORD your God.<BR>
      11 Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one
      to another.<BR>
      12 And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou
      profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.<BR>
      13 Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob him: the
      wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night
      until the morning.<BR>
      14 Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before
      the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD.<BR>
      15 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not
      respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the
      mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.<BR>
      16 Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people:
      neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour:
      I am the LORD.<BR>
      17 Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt
      in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.<BR>
      18 Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children
      of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself:
      I am the LORD.<BR>
      19 Ye shall keep my statutes.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>GRADUAL. </B><I>PS. 30.</I> I will magnify thee, O Lord, for
      thou hast set me up: and hast not made my foes to triumph over
      me. V. O Lord my God, I cried unto thee: and thou hast healed
      me: thou, Lord, hast brought my soul out of hell, thou hast kept
      my life from them that go down to the pit.<BR>

      dedication, and it was winter.<BR>
      23 And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.<BR>
      24 Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How
      long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell
      us plainly.<BR>
      25 Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the
      works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.<BR>
      26 But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said
      unto you.<BR>
      27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:<BR>
      28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish,
      neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.<BR>
      29 My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no
      man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.<BR>
      30 I and my Father are one.<BR>
      31 Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.<BR>
      32 Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shown you from
      my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?<BR>
      33 The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee
      not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest
      thyself God.<BR>
      34 Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said,
      Ye are gods?<BR>
      35 If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and
      the scripture cannot be broken;<BR>
      36 Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into
      the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of
      God?<BR>
      37 If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.<BR>
      38 But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works:
      that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and
      I in him.<BR>

      Grant, O most merciful God: that we, which here bring unto thee
      this sacrifice of propitiation and thanksgiving, may offer the
      same in all singleness and lowliness of heart. Through.<BR>

      <B>COMMUNION.</B> <I>Ps. 26. </I>I will wash my hands in innocency,
      O Lord, and so will I go to thine altar: that I may shew the
      voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR>
      O Lord, who hast vouchsafed to make us partakers of thy heavenly
      benediction: grant, we pray thee, that the pledge, which thou
      hast given us in this holy Sacrament, may be fulfilled in us
      unto everlasting salvation. Through.<BR>

      <I>Over the people. </I>Let us pray. Bow down before the Lord.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR>
      Assist us mercifully, O Lord, in these our supplications: that
      we, whom thou dost suffer to put our trust and confidence in
      thy mercy, may of thy goodness obtain the wonted effects of thy
      compassion. Through.<BR>
