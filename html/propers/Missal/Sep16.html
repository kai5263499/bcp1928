      <B>The Epistle. <FONT COLOR="#000000">2 Corinthians 1:3-7</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      3 BRETHREN: Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus
      Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;<BR />
      4 Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able
      to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith
      we ourselves are comforted of God.<BR />
      5 For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation
      also aboundeth by Christ.<BR />
      6 And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and
      salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings
      which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your
      consolation and salvation.<BR />
      7 And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers
      of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation: in
      Christ Jesus our Lord.</FONT></P>

      hath great delight in his commandments. V. His seed shall be
      mighty upon earth: the generation of the faithful shall be blessed.

      endureth for ever.</FONT></P>

      <P><B>The Gospel. St Matthew 16:24-27<BR />
      </B><FONT COLOR="#000000">24 Then said Jesus unto his disciples,
      If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take
      up his cross, and follow me.<BR />
      25 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever
      will lose his life for my sake shall find it.<BR />
      26 For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world,
      and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for
      his soul?<BR />
      27 For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with
      his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his
      works.</FONT></P>
