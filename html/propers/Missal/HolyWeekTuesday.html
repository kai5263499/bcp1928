      as for us, it behoveth us to glory in the Cross of our Lord Jesus
      Christ: in whom is our salvation, our life and resurrection:
      by whom we were saved and obtained our freedom Ps. 67. God be
      merciful unto us, and bless us: and shew us the light of his
      countenance, and be merciful unto us. But as for us.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>COLLECT</B>.<BR>
      O Lord God, whose blessed Son, our Saviour, gave his back to
      the smiters and hid not his face from shame: grant us grace to
      take joyfully the sufferings of the present time, in full assurance
      of the glory that shall be revealed. Through the same thy Son
      Jesus christ our Lord. [Who.]<BR>
<BR>
      <B>COLLECT 2</B>. Of Palm Sunday<BR>
      <B><BR>
      For the EPISTLE. </B>Isaiah 50:5-11<BR>
      5 The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious,
      neither turned away back.<BR>
      6 I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked
      off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.<BR>
      7 For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded:
      therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I
      shall not be ashamed.<BR>
      8 He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let
      us stand together: who is mine adversary? let him come near to
      me.<BR>
      9 Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who is he that shall condemn
      me? lo, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat
      them up.<BR>
      10 Who is among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice
      of his servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light?
      let him trust in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God.<BR>
      11 Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves
      about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the
      sparks that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand;
      ye shall lie down in sorrow.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>GRADUAL.</B> <I>Ps. 35. </I>Nevertheless, when they were sick,
      I put on sackcloth, and humbled myself with fasting: and my prayers
      shall turn into ,mine own bosom. V. Plead thou my cause, O Lord,
      with them that strive with me, and fight thou against them that
      fight against me: lay hand upon the shield and buckler, and stand
      up to help me.<BR>
<BR>
      The <B>PASSION</B> of our Lord Jesus Christ, according to Mark.
      St. Mark 15. 4.<BR>
      4 And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing?
      behold how many things they witness against thee.<BR>
      5 But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.<BR>
      6 Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever
      they desired.<BR>
      7 And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them
      that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder
      in the insurrection.<BR>
      8 And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as
      he had ever done unto them.<BR>
      9 But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto
      you the King of the Jews?<BR>
      10 For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.<BR>
      11 But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather
      release Barabbas unto them.<BR>
      12 And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye
      then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?<BR>
      13 And they cried out again, Crucify him.<BR>
      14 Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And
      they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.<BR>
      15 And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas
      unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to
      be crucified.<BR>
      16 And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium;
      and they call together the whole band.<BR>
      17 And they clothed him with purple, and plaited a crown of thorns,
      and put it about his head,<BR>
      18 And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!<BR>
      19 And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon
      him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.<BR>
      20 And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from
      him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify
      him.<BR>
      21 And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming
      out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear
      his cross.<BR>
      22 And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being
      interpreted, The place of a skull.<BR>
      23 And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he
      received it not.<BR>
      24 And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments,
      casting lots upon them, what every man should take.<BR>
      25 And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.<BR>
      26 And the superscription of his accusation was written over,
      THE KING OF THE JEWS.<BR>
      27 And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right
      hand, and the other on his left.<BR>
      28 And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered
      with the transgressors.<BR>
      29 And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads,
      and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest
      it in three days,<BR>
      30 Save thyself, and come down from the cross.<BR>
      31 Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves
      with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.<BR>
      32 Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross,
      that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with
      him reviled him.<BR>
      33 And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over
      the whole land until the ninth hour.<BR>
      34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,
      Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My
      God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<BR>
      35 And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said,
      Behold, he calleth Elias.<BR>
      36 And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar, and put it
      on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see
      whether Elias will come to take him down.<BR>
      37 And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.<BR>
      (Here genuflect and pause awhile). <I>That which follows is sung
      in the tone of the Gospel:</I><BR>
      38 And the veil of the temple was rent in twain, from the top
      to the bottom.<BR>
      39 And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw
      that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said: Truly this
      man was the Son of God.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>OFFERTORY.</B> <I>Ps. 140. </I>Keep me, O Lord, from the hands
      of the ungodly: preserve me from the wicked men.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>SECRET.<BR>
      </B>Grant, we beseech thee, O Lord, that this sacrifice which
      we offer unto thee in this time of fasting ordained for the healing
      of our souls, may powerfully avail for our salvation. Through.<BR>
