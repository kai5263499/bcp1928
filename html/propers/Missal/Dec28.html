      babes, O God, and of sucklings hast thou perfected praise: because

      Almighty God, who out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast
      ordained strength, and madest infants to glorify thee by their
      deaths: mortify and kill all vices in us; and so strengthen us
      by thy grace, that by the innocency of our lives, and constancy
      of our faith even unto death, we may glorify thy holy Name. Through
      Jesus Christ our Lord. [Who.]</P>

      </I><B>EPISTLE. Revelation 14:1-5</B><BR />
      1 And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and
      with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's
      name written in their foreheads. <BR />
      2 And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters,
      and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of
      harpers harping with their harps: <BR />
      3 And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and
      before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn
      that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which
      were redeemed from the earth. <BR />
      4 These are they which were not defiled with women; for they
      are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever
      he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits
      unto God and to the Lamb. <BR />
      5 And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without
      fault before the throne of God. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps. </I>124. </B>Our souls escaped: even as a
      bird out of the snare of the fowler. V. The snare is broken and
      we are delivered. Our help standeth in the name of the Lord,
      who hath made heaven and earth.</P>

      <P><I>&para; The following </I>Alleluia <I>with its verse is
      said whenever this Feast falls on a Sunday, or has the rank of
      Double of I Class. But it is always said on the Octave Day, and
      in Votive Masses before Septuagesima, and after Pentecost.</I></P>

      <P>Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>Ps. </I>113. Praise the Lord, ye
      children: O praise the Name of the Lord. Alleluia.</P>

      <P><I>The Tract is not said when </I>Alleluia is said as above.</P>

      <P><B>TRACT. <I>Ps. </I>79.</B> The blood of thy Saints have
      they shed like water on every side of Jerusalem. V. And there
      was no man to bury them. Avenge, O Lord, the blood of thy Saints,
      that is shed upon the earth.</P>

      <P><I>&para; In Votive Masses in Eastertide, instead of the Gradual
      is said the </I>Alleluia <I>as above, and then</I></P>

      <P>V. <I>Ecclus. </I>39. Thy Saints, O Lord, shall flourish like
      the lily, and shall be even as the odour of balsam before thee.
      Alleluia.<BR />

      <B>GOSPEL <I>St. Matthew </I>2:13-18<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>13 And when they were
      departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in
      a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother,
      and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word:
      for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him. <BR />
      14 When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night,
      and departed into Egypt: <BR />
      15 And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled
      which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt
      have I called my son. <BR />
      16 Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men,
      was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children
      that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two
      years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently
      inquired of the wise men. <BR />
      17 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet,
      saying, <BR />
      18 In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping,
      and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would
      not be comforted, because they are not. <I>The Creed is said
      on account of the Octave.<BR />
<BR />
      </I><B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps.</I> 124. </B>Our soul is escaped even
      as a bird out of the snare of the fowler: the snare is broken
      and we are delivered.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>SECRET.</B><BR />
      Grant, O Lord, we pray thee, that the devout prayers of thy Saints
      may never fail to succour and defend us: that these our oblations
      may be rendered acceptable in thy sight; and that we may be made
      worthy to obtain for our sins the pardon of thy mercy. Through.</P>

      <P>PREFACE <I>and </I>CANON <I>of Christmas.<BR />
<BR />
      </I><B>COMMUNION. <I>St. Matt. </I>2. </B>In Rama was there a

      weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because
      they are not.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      we beseech thee, O Lord, that the gifts which we have received
      in these holy mysteries: may at the intercession of thy Saints,
      effectually avail for our succour both in this life and in that
      which is to come. Through.</P>

      Day.</I></P>
