      <B>LESSON. <I>2 Kings </I>5:1-15</B><BR>
      1 IN those days: Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria,
      was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him
      the LORD had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty
      man in valour, but he was a leper. <BR>
      2 And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought
      away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she
      waited on Naaman's wife. <BR>
      3 And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with
      the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of his
      leprosy. <BR>
      4 And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said
      the maid that is of the land of Israel. <BR>
      5 And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter
      unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten
      talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes
      of raiment. <BR>
      6 And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now
      when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith
      sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him
      of his leprosy. <BR>
      7 And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter,
      that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to
      make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man
      of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he
      seeketh a quarrel against me. <BR>
      8 And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the
      king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king,
      saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now
      to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel. <BR>
      9 So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood
      at the door of the house of Elisha. <BR>
      10 And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash
      in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee,
      and thou shalt be clean. <BR>
      11 But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought,
      He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name
      of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and
      recover the leper. <BR>
      12 Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than
      all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean?
      So he turned and went away in a rage. <BR>
      13 And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said,
      My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest
      thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to
      thee, Wash, and be clean? <BR>
      14 Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan,
      according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came
      again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.
<BR>
      15 And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company,
      and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know
      that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel.</P>

      <P><B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps. </I>56.</B> Thou, O God, tellest my flittings:
      put my tears into thy bottle. V. Be merciful unto me, O God,
      for man goeth about to devour me : he is daily fighting, and
      troubling me.</P>

      <P><B>TRACT. <I>Ps</I>. 103. </B>O Lord, deal not with us after
      our sins; nor reward us according to wickednesses. V. Ps. 79.
      Lord, remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and
      that soon: for we are come to great misery. V. <I>(Here genuflect.)</I>
      Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name, O
      Lord: O deliver us and be merciful unto our sins, for thy Name's
      sake.</P>

      <B>GOSPEL. <I>St. Luke </I>4:23-30<BR>
      <FONT SIZE="-1"><IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></FONT></B>23
      At that time : Jesus said unto the Pharisees: Ye will surely
      say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever
      we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country.
<BR>
      24 And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted
      in his own country. <BR>
      25 But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the
      days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six
      months, when great famine was throughout all the land; <BR>
      26 But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a
      city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow. <BR>
      27 And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the
      prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian.
<BR>
      28 And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things,
      were filled with wrath, <BR>
      29 And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto
      the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they
      might cast him down headlong. <BR>
      30 But he passing through the midst of them went his way,</P>

      <P><B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps</I>. 55.</B> Hear my prayer, O God, and
      hide not thyself from my petition: take heed unto me, and hear
      me.</P>

      <P><B>SECRET.</B><BR>
      O Lord, we pray thee that this oblation, which of our bounden
      service we do offer unto thee, may by thee be made a sacrament
      effectual unto our salvation. Through.</P>

      <P><B>COMMUNION. <I>Ps</I>. 14. </B>Who shall give salvation
      unto Israel out of Sion? When the Lord turneth the captivity
      of his people, then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel shall be
      glad.</P>

      <P><B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR>
      Almighty and most merciful God, we humbly beseech thee: that
      those things which we have taken our outward lips, we may inwardly
      receive in purity of heart. Through.</P>

      <P><B>COLLECT.</B><BR>
      Assist us, O Lord, we pray thee, with the help of thy mercy:
      that whereas through our sins and wickedness, we are sore beset
      by many and great dangers, we may be found worthy to be defended
      from the same by thy protection and preserved by thy deliverance.
      Through.<BR>
