      INTROIT. <I>Gaudete. Philippians</I> 4:4-6<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B> REJOICE in the Lord alway:
      and again I say, Rejoice: let your moderation be known unto all
      men: the Lord is at hand. Be careful for nothing: but in every
      thing, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your
      requests be made known unto God. <I>Ps. 85:1 </I>Lord, thou art
      become gracious unto thy land: thou hast turned away the captivity
      of Jacob. V. Glory be. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      ALMIGHTY God, give us grace that we may cast away the works of
      darkness, and put upon us the armour of light, now in the time
      of this mortal life, in which thy Son, Jesus Christ, came to
      visit us in great humility: that in the last day, when he shall
      come again in his glorious majesty to judge both the quick and
      the dead; we may rise to the life immortal. Through the same
      Jesus Christ thy Son, our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with
      thee in the unity of the Holy Ghost, ever one God, world without
      end. AMEN.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      O LORD Jesus Christ, who at thy first coming didst send thy messenger
      to prepare thy way before thee: grant that the ministers and
      stewards of thy mysteries may likewise so prepare and make ready
      thy way, by turning the hearts of the disobedient to the wisdom
      of the just, that at thy second coming to judge the world we
      may be found an acceptable people in thy sight, Who livest and
      reignest with the Father and the Holy Spirit ever, one God, world
      without end. AMEN. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>EPISTLE. <I>1 Corinthians </I>4:1-5</B><BR />
      1 Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ,
      and stewards of the mysteries of God. <BR />
      2 Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.
<BR />
      3 But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged
      of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.
<BR />
      4 For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified:
      but he that judgeth me is the Lord. <BR />
      5 Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come,
      who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and
      will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall
      every man have praise of God. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps. </I>80.<I> </I></B>Shew thyself, O Lord, thou
      that sittest upon the Cherubims, stir up thy strength and come.
      V. Hear, O thou Shepherd of Israel: thou that leadest Joseph
      like a sheep. <BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V.<I> </I>Stir up thy strength, O Lord: and
      come and help us. Alleluia<BR />
<BR />
      <B>GOSPEL.<I> St. Matthew</I> 11:2-10<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B> 2 Now when John had heard
      in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,
<BR />
      3 And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look
      for another? <BR />
      4 Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and show John again those
      things which ye do hear and see: <BR />
      5 The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers
      are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and
      the poor have the gospel preached to them. <BR />
      6 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me. <BR />
      7 And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes
      concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see?
      A reed shaken with the wind? <BR />
      8 But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment?
      behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses. <BR />
      9 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto
      you, and more than a prophet. <BR />
      10 For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger
      before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps. </I>85.<I> </I></B>Lord, thou art become
      gracious unto thy land: thou hast turned away the captivity of
      Jacob: thou hast forgiven the offence of thy people.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>SECRET.</B><BR />
      GRANT, we beseech thee, O Lord, that the continual oblation of
      this our bounden duty and service: may evermore avail for the
      fulfilment of the institution of thine ordinance and for the
      accomplishment in us of the wondrous work of thy salvation. [Through.]<BR />
<BR />
      <B>COMMUNION. <I>Isa. </I>35.<I> </I></B>Say to them that are
      of a fearful heart: Be strong, fear not: behold your God will
      come and save you. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      HAVE mercy upon us, O Lord, we beseech thee: and grant that the
      heavenly assistance of thy holy mysteries may so cleanse us from
      all our iniquities, that we may be made ready worthily to keep
      thy coming festival. [Through.] <BR />
