      O God, who dost grant unto the righteous the reward of their

      <B>LESSON <I>Ezekiel </I>36:23-28</B><BR>
      23 THUS saith the Lord God: I will sanctify my great name, which
      was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the
      midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD,
      saith the Lord GOD, when I shall be sanctified in you before
      their eyes. <BR>
      24 For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you
      out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land.
<BR>
      25 Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be
      clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will
      I cleanse you. <BR>
      26 A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I
      put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your
      flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. <BR>
      27 And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk
      in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.
<BR>
      28 And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers;
      and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God. <BR>
<BR>
      <B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps</I>. 34.</B> Come, ye children, and hearken
      unto me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord. V. they had an
      eye unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed.<BR>
<BR>
      <I>Here is not said </I>Let us bow the knee, <I>but V. </I>The
      Lord be with you. Let us pray.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR>
      Grant, we beseech thee, Almighty God, that we duly mortifying
      the flesh by this our abstinence, may inwardly rejoice in holiness
      of spirit : that being delivered from all earthly and carnal
      affections we may speedily obtain thy heavenly promises. Through.<BR>

      </I><B>LESSON. <I>Isaiah </I>1:16-19</B><BR>
      16 THUS saith the Lord God: Wash you, make you clean; put away
      the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;
<BR>
      17 Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge
      the fatherless, plead for the widow. <BR>
      18 Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though
      your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though
      they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. <BR>
      19 If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the
      land: saith the Lord Almighty.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps</I>. 33.</B> Blessed are the people, whose
      God is the Lord Jehovah: and blessed are the folk that he hath
      chosen to him to be his inheritance. V. By the word of the Lord
      were the heavens made: and all the hosts of them by the breath
      of his mouth.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>TRACT. <I>Ps</I>. 103. </B>O Lord, deal not with us after
      our sins; nor reward us according to wickednesses. V. Ps. 79.
      Lord, remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and
      that soon: for we are come to great misery. V. <I>(Here genuflect.)</I>
      Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name, O
      Lord: O deliver us and be merciful unto our sins, for thy Name's
      sake.<BR>

      <B>GOSPEL <I>St. John </I>9:1-38<BR>
      </B><A HREF="mailto:apostle@episcopalnet.org"><IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>1
      AT that time: Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from
      his birth. <BR>
      2 And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this
      man, or his parents, that he was born blind? <BR>
      3 Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents:
      but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. <BR>
      4 I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day:
      the night cometh, when no man can work. <BR>
      5 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
<BR>
      6 When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay
      of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with
      the clay, <BR>
      7 And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is
      by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed,
      and came seeing. <BR>
      8 The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him
      that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?
<BR>
      9 Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he
      said, I am he. <BR>
      10 Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?
<BR>
      11 He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay,
      and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam,
      and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight. <BR>
      12 Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.
<BR>
      13 They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.
<BR>
      14 And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened
      his eyes. <BR>
      15 Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received
      his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and
      I washed, and do see. <BR>
      16 Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God,
      because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can
      a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division
      among them. <BR>
      17 They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him,
      that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet. <BR>
      18 But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been
      blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents
      of him that had received his sight. <BR>
      19 And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say
      was born blind? how then doth he now see? <BR>
      20 His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our
      son, and that he was born blind: <BR>
      21 But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened
      his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak
      for himself. <BR>
      22 These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews:
      for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess
      that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. <BR>
      23 Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him. <BR>
      24 Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto
      him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.
<BR>
      25 He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know
      not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.
<BR>
      26 Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened
      he thine eyes? <BR>
      27 He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not
      hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?
<BR>
      28 Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but
      we are Moses' disciples. <BR>
      29 We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we
      know not from whence he is. <BR>
      30 The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous
      thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened
      mine eyes. <BR>
      31 Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be
      a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. <BR>
      32 Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened
      the eyes of one that was born blind. <BR>
      33 If this man were not of God, he could do nothing. <BR>
      34 They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born
      in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out. <BR>
      35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found
      him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? <BR>
      36 He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe
      on him? <BR>
      37 And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is
      he that talketh with thee. <BR>
      38 And he said, Lord, I believe. <I>(Here Genuflect) </I>And
      he worshipped him. <BR>
<BR>
      <B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps</I>. 66. </B>O praise our God ye people,
      and make the voice of his praise to be heard: who holdeth our
      soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to slip: praised be
      God, who hath not cast out my prayer, not turned his mercy from
      me.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>SECRET. </B><BR>
      We humbly beseech thee, Almighty God: that by this sacrifice
      we may be cleansed from all our sins, and obtain of thee true
      healing both of body and soul. Through.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>COMMUNION. <I>St. John </I>9. </B>The Lord made clay of the
      spittle, and anointed mine eyes: and I went, and washed, and
      received sight, and believed in God.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION. </B><BR>
      O Lord, our God, who hast made us partakers of this holy Sacrament:
      grant, we beseech thee, that we may thereby inwardly be satisfied
      with heavenly food, and outwardly defended against all adversities.
      Through.<BR>
<BR>
      <I>Over the people </I>Let us pray. Bow down before the Lord.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR>
      Let thy merciful ears, O Lord, be open to the prayers of thy
      humble servants: and that they may obtain their petitions make
      them to ask such things as shall please thee. Through.<BR>
