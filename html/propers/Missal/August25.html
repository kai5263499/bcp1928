      </B>O GOD, who didst exalt blessed Louis thy Confessor from an
      earthly realm to the glory of thy heavenly Kingdom: grant, we
      pray thee, that by his merits and intercession; we may be made
      heirs of the King of kings, even Jesus Christ thy Son our Lord.
      Who liveth and reigneth with thee.</P>

      <B>For the Epistle. <FONT COLOR="#000000">Wisdom 10:10-14<BR />
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1">[From Mass 4, In virtute tua]</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      10 The Lord guided the righteous in right paths, shewed him the
      kingdom of God, and gave him knowledge of holy things: made him
      rich in his travels, and multiplied the fruit of his labours.<BR />
      11 In the covetousness of such as oppressed him he stood by him,
      and made him rich.<BR />
      12 He defended him from his enemies, and kept him safe from those
      that lay in wait, and in a sore conflict he gave him the victory;
      that he might know that godliness is stronger than all.<BR />
      13 When the righteous was sold, wisdom forsook him not, but delivered
      him from sin: she went down with him into the pit,<BR />
      14 and left him not in bonds, till she brought him the sceptre
      of the kingdom, and power against those that oppressed him: as
      for those that had accused him, she shewed them to be liars,
      and gave him perpetual glory, O Lord our God.</FONT></P>

      <P><B>The Gospel. St Luke 19:12-21<BR />
      </B><FONT SIZE="-1">[From Mass 15, Second Gospel]<BR />
      </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">12 At that time, Jesus spake this
      parable unto his disciples: A certain nobleman went into a far
      country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.<BR />
      13 And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds,
      and said unto them, Occupy till I come.<BR />
      14 But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him,
      saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.<BR />
      15 And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received
      the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto
      him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much
      every man had gained by trading.<BR />
      16 Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten
      pounds.<BR />
      17 And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou
      hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over
      ten cities.<BR />
      18 And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five
      pounds.<BR />
      19 And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.<BR />
      20 And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound,
      which I have kept laid up in a napkin:<BR />
      21 For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest
      up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not
      sow.<BR />
      22 And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge
      thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere
      man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not
      sow:<BR />
      23 Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that
      at my coming I might have required mine own with usury?<BR />
      24 And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound,
      and give it to him that hath ten pounds.<BR />
      25 (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)<BR />
      26 For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be
      given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be
      taken away from him.</FONT></P>

      <P><B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps. 89 </I></B>My truth also and my mercy
      shall be with him: and in my Name shall his horn be exalted.
      (alleluia)</P>

      <P><B>SECRET.<BR />
      </B>GRANT, we beseech thee, Almighty God,: that, like as blessed
      Louis thy Confessor, despising all the pleasures of this world,
      swought only to be acceptable unto Christ our King; so, by his
      intercession, we may be rendered aqcceptable in thy sight. Through
      the same.</P>

      <P><B>COMMUNION. <I>St. Matthew 24 </I></B>Blessed is that servant
      whom his lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say
      unto you, that he shall make him ruler over all his goods. (Alleluia).</P>

      <P><B>POSTCOMMUNION.<BR />
      &nbsp;</B>O GOD, who didst make blessed Louis thy Confessor to
      be wondrous upon earth and glorious in heaven: vouchsafe, we
      pray thee; that he may ever be the effectual defender of thy
      Church. Through.</P>
