      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" />I AM risen, and am present
      with thee, alleluia: thou hast laid thine hand upon me, alleluia;
      such knowledge is too wonderful and excellent for me, alleluia,
      alleluia. <I>Ps. ibid.</I> O Lord, thou hast searched me out
      and known me: thou knowest my down sitting and mine uprising.
      V. Glory be.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>COLLECT.<BR />
      </B>ALMIGHTY God, who through thine only begotten Son Jesus Christ
      hast overcome death, and opened unto us the gate of everlasting
      life : we humbly beseech thee, that, as by thy special grace
      preventing us thou dost put into our minds good desires, so by
      thy continual help we may bring the same to good effect. Through
      the same Jesus Christ our Lord. Who liveth and reigneth with
      thee and the Holy Ghost ever, one God, world without end.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>EPISTLE. <I>Colossians</I> 3:1-4</B><BR />
      1 If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are
      above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. <BR />
      2 Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.
<BR />
      3 For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. <BR />
      4 When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also
      appear with him in glory. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps</I>. 118.</B> This is the day which the Lord
      hath made: we will rejoice and be glad in it. V. O give thanks
      unto the Lord, for he is gracious: and his mercy endureth for
      ever.<BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. I <I>Cor.</I> 5. Christ our Passover is
      sacrificed for us.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>SEQUENCE. <I>Victimae Paschali.<BR />
      </I></B>Christians to the Paschal Victim offer your thankful
      praises.<BR />
      The Lamb the sheep redeemeth: Christ by sin undefiled, reconcileth
      sinners to the Father.<BR />
      Death and life joined together in that conflict stupendous :
      the King of Life who died deathless reigneth.<BR />
      Declare to us, Mary, the vision of thy journey.<BR />
      &quot;I saw the Tomb of Christ living: and likewise the glory
      of the Risen:<BR />
      Bright Angels attesting, the shroud and napkin resting.<BR />
      Yea, Christ my hope is arisen : to Galilee he now goes before
      you.&quot;<BR />
      Christ indeed from death is risen, so we know most surely: O
      King and Conqueror, grant to us mercy, Amen. Alleluia.<BR />
<BR />
      <I>The Sequence is said until Low Sunday exclusive.<BR />
<BR />
      </I><B>GOSPEL. <I>St. John </I>20:1-10</B><BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" />1 The first day of the week
      cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre,
      and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre. <BR />
      2 Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other
      disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken
      away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they
      have laid him. <BR />
      3 Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came
      to the sepulchre. <BR />
      4 So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun
      Peter, and came first to the sepulchre. <BR />
      5 And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes
      lying; yet went he not in. <BR />
      6 Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre,
      and seeth the linen clothes lie, <BR />
      7 And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the
      linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself. <BR />
      8 Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to
      the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed. <BR />
      9 For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again
      from the dead. <BR />
      10 Then the disciples went away again unto their own home. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps</I>. 76. </B>The earth trembled and was still,
      when God arose to judgement, alleluia.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>SECRET</B>.<BR />
      WE BESEECH thee, O Lord, mercifully to accept the prayers and
      oblations of thy people: that this beginning of thy Paschal Mysteries
      may by the operation of thy grace be unto us a wholesome medicine
      unto everlasting life. Through.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>COMMUNION. I <I>Cor. </I>5.</B> Christ our Passover is sacrificed
      for us, alleluia: therefore let us keep the feast with the unleavened
      bread of sincerity and truth, alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      WE BESEECH thee, O Lord, put into our hearts the love of thy
      Holy Spirit: that as thou hast now fulfilled us with this Paschal
      Sacrament, so thou wouldest make us to continue in all godly
      concord. [Through .] <BR />
<BR />
      V. Depart in peace, alleluia, alleluia.<BR />
      R. Thanks be to God, alleluia, alleluia.<BR />
      <I>and thus is said the Dismissal unto Saturday in Easter Week
      inclusive.<BR />

      <P><CENTER><B>ANOTHER COLLECT, EPISTLE, AND GOSPEL.</B></CENTER></P>

      <P><BR />
<BR />
      <I>If in any Church the Holy Communion be twice celebrated on
      Easter Day, the following Collect, Epistle, and Gospel may be
      used at the first Communion.<BR />
<BR />
      </I><B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      O GOD, who for our redemption didst give thine only begotten
      Son to the death of the Cross, and by his glorious Resurrection
      hast delivered us from the power of our enemy : grant us so to
      die daily from sin, that we may evermore live with him in the
      joy of his Resurrection. Through the same thy Son Christ our
      Lord. [Who.]<BR />
<BR />
      <B>EPISTLE. <I>I Corinthians </I>5:6-8</B><BR />
      6 BRETHREN; Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole
      lump? <BR />
      7 Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump,
      as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed
      for us: <BR />
      8 Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither
      with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened
      bread of sincerity and truth. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>St. Mark </I>16:1-8</B><BR />
      1 And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the
      mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they
      might come and anoint him. <BR />
      2 And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they
      came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun. <BR />
      3 And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the
      stone from the door of the sepulchre? <BR />
      4 And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away:
      for it was very great. <BR />
      5 And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting
      on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they
      were affrighted. <BR />
      6 And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of
      Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold
      the place where they laid him. <BR />
      7 But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth
      before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto
      you. <BR />
      8 And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for
      they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to
      any man; for they were afraid. <BR />
<BR />
      <I>&para; Within the Octave of Easter, Mass is not said of any
      double or semidouble Feast, but Doubles which can be transferred
      are celebrated after the Octave. But of Doubles which cannot
      be transferred or Semidoubles and Simples occurring after this
      triduum, a Commemoration only is made.<BR />
