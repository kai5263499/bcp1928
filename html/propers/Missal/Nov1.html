      O ALMIGHTY God, who hast knit together thine elect in one communion
      and fellowship, in the mystical body of thy Son Christ our Lord;
      Grant us grace so to follow thy blessed Saints in all virtuous
      and godly living, that we may come to those unspeakable joys
      which thou hast prepared for those who unfeignedly love thee;
      through the same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</P>

      <P><BR />
      <B>For the Epistle. <I>Revelation</I> 7:2</B></P>

      <P>AND I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the
      seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the
      four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,
      saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till
      we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads. And
      I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were
      sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes
      of the children of Israel. After this I beheld, and, lo, a great
      multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds,
      and peoples, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before
      the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;
      and cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which
      sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb. And all the angels
      stood round about the throne, and about the elders and the four
      living creatures, and fell before the throne on their faces,
      and worshipped God, saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom,
      and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our
      God for ever and ever. Amen. And one of the elders answered,
      saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes?
      and whence came they? And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest.
      And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation,
      and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood
      of the Lamb. Therefore are they before the throne of God, and
      serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on
      the throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more,
      neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them,
      nor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne
      shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of
      waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.</P>

      <P><B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps. </I>34. </B>Fear the Lord, ye that are
      his Saints: for they that fear him lack nothing. V. they who
      seek the Lord shall want no manner of thing that is good.<BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>St. Matt. </I>11. Come unto me all
      ye that labour and are heavy laden: and I will give you rest.
      Alleluia. <BR />
      </P>

      <P><B>The Gospel. <I>St. Matthew </I>5:1</B><BR />
      JESUS seeing the multitudes, went up into a mountain: and when
      he was set, his disciples came unto him: and he opened his mouth,
      and taught them, saying, Blessed are the poor in spirit: for
      their's is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn:
      for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek: for they shall
      inherit the earth. Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst
      after righteousness: for they shall be filled. Blessed are the
      merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in
      heart: for they shall see God. Blessed are the peacemakers: for
      they shall be called the children of God. Blessed are they which
      are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for their's is the kingdom
      of heaven. Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute
      you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for
      my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward
      in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before
      you.</P>
