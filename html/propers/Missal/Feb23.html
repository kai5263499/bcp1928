      <B>For the Epistle. <I><FONT COLOR="#000000">Ecclesiasticus</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#000000"> 44:22-45:5, 7</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      22 THE blessing of the Lord was upon the head of the righteous.
      Therefore the Lord gave him an heritage; and divided his portion
      among the twelve tribes.<BR />
      1 And he found favour in the sight of all fleshy. And the Lord
      magnified him so that his enemies stood in fear of him. By his
      words he caused the wonders to cease:<BR />
      2 he made him glorious in the sight of kings, and gave him a
      commandment for his people, and shewed him his glory.<BR />
      45:4 He sanctified him in his faithfulness and meekness, and
      chose him out of all men.<BR />
      5 He gave him commandments before his face, even the law of life
      and knowledge, and exalted him.<BR />
      7 An everlasting covenant he made with him: the Lord beautified
      him with ornaments of righteousness: and clothed him with a robe
      of glory.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">GRADUAL. &nbsp;<I>Ps. </I>92</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000">. The righteous shall flourish like a palm-tree:
      and shall spread abroad like a cedar in Libanus in the house
      of the Lord. V. To tell of thy loving-kindness in the morning,
      and of thy truth in the night-season.</FONT></P>

      <P><B>GOSPEL. <I>St John</I> 15:12-16<BR />
      </B><FONT COLOR="#000000">12 This is my commandment, That ye
      love one another, as I have loved you.<BR />
      13 Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his
      life for his friends.<BR />
      14 Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.<BR />
      15 Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth
      not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all
      things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto
      you.<BR />
      16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained
      you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit
      should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in
      my name, he may give it you.</FONT></P>
