    <p><strong>INTROIT. Mihi autem. Ps. 139</strong><br />
      RIGHT dear are thy friends unto me, O God, and held in highest honour: their rule and governance is exceeding stedfast. Ps. ibid. Lord, thou hast searched me out and known me: thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising. V. Glory be.</p>
    <p>GRANT, O merciful God, that as thine holy Apostle Saint James, leaving his father and all that he had, without delay was obedient unto the calling of thy Son Jesus Christ, and followed Him: so we, forsaking all worldly and carnal affections; may be evermore ready to follow thy holy commandments, Through the same Jesus Christ our Lord.  [Who.]<br />

    <p><strong>EPISTLE. Acts 11:27 - 12:3</strong><br />
      27 In these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch. <br />
      28 And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar. <br />
      29 Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea: <br />
      30 Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul. <br />
      1 Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church. <br />
      2 And he killed James the brother of John with the sword. <br />
      3 And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. </p>
    <p><strong>GRADUAL. Ps. 45.</strong> Thou shalt make them princes in all lands: they shall remember thy Name, O Lord. V. Instead of thy fathers thou shalt have children: therefore shall the people give thanks unto thee.<br />
    Alleluia, alleluia. V. Ps. 139. Right dear are thy friends unto me, O God, and held in highest honour: their rule and governance is exceeding stedfast. Alleluia. </p>
    <p><strong>GOSPEL. St. Matthew 20:20 - 28</strong><br />
      20 At that time: Then came to him the mother of Zebedeeâ€™s children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him. <br />
      21 And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom. <br />
      22 But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able. <br />
      23 And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father. <br />
      24 And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren. <br />
      25 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them. <br />
      26 But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; <br />
      27 And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant: <br />
    28 Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many. </p>
    <p><strong>OFFERTORY. Ps. 19. </strong>Their sound is gone out into all lands: and their words into the ends of the world.</p>
    <p><strong>SECRET.</strong> WE pray thee, O Lord, that the blessed sufferings of Saint James thy Apostle may commend unto thee the oblations of thy people: that whereas our own righteousness availeth not to their worthiness, his prayers may render them acceptable unto thee.  Through.</p>
    <p><strong>PREFACE of the Apostles.</strong><br />
    AND also that we should humbly entreat thee, O Lord, the everlasting Shepherd, not to leave thy flock untended, but by thy blessed Apostles to keep it in thy continual ;protection; that it may be governed by those same rulers, whom in thy stead, thou hast given for thy work, as shepherds of thy People.  Therefore.</p>
    <p><strong>COMMUNION. St. Matt. 19.28.</strong> Ye which have followed me shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>
    <p><strong>POSTCOMMUNION. </strong>GRANT, O Lord, that we who on this feast of thy blessed apostle Saint James: have joyfully received thy holy mysteries; may by his intercession obtain thy succour.  Through.</p>
