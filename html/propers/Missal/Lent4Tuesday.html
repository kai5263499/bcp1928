      We beseech thee, O Lord, that we may in such wise observe this
      solemn ordinance of fasting: that by reason of the same we may
      increase in all godliness of conversation, and effectually obtain
      the continual succour of thy mercy. Through.<BR>

      </I><B>LESSON. <I>Exod. </I>32:7-14</B><BR>
      7 IN those days: the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down;
      for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt,
      have corrupted themselves: <BR>
      8 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded
      them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped
      it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods,
      O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
<BR>
      9 And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and,
      behold, it is a stiffnecked people: <BR>
      10 Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against
      them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a
      great nation. <BR>
      11 And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth
      thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought
      forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty
      hand? <BR>
      12 Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief
      did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to
      consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce
      wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people. <BR>
      13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom
      thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will
      multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land
      that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall
      inherit it for ever. <BR>
      14 And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto
      his people. <BR>
      <B><BR>
      GRADUAL. <I>Ps</I>. 44. </B>Arise, O Lord, and help us: and deliver
      us for thy mercy's sake. V. We have heard with our ears, O God,
      our fathers have told us: what thou hast done in their time of
      old.<BR>

      <B>GOSPEL. <I>St. John </I>7:14-30<BR>
      </B><A HREF="mailto:apostle@episcopalnet.org"><IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>14
      AT that time: about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into
      the temple, and taught. <BR>
      15 And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters,
      having never learned? <BR>
      16 Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but
      his that sent me. <BR>
      17 If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine,
      whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself. <BR>
      18 He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he
      that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no
      unrighteousness is in him. <BR>
      19 Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth
      the law? Why go ye about to kill me? <BR>
      20 The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth
      about to kill thee? <BR>
      21 Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and
      ye all marvel. <BR>
      22 Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it
      is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise
      a man. <BR>
      23 If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the
      law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because
      I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day? <BR>
      24 Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous
      judgment. <BR>
      25 Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom
      they seek to kill? <BR>
      26 But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him.
      Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ? <BR>
      27 Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh,
      no man knoweth whence he is. <BR>
      28 Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both
      know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself,
      but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not. <BR>
      29 But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me. <BR>
      30 Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him,
      because his hour was not yet come. <BR>
<BR>
      <B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps</I>. 40. </B>I waited patiently for the Lord,
      and he inclined unto me: He heard my calling , and he hath put
      a new song in my mouth, even a thanksgiving unto our God.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>SECRET.</B><BR>
      Grant, O Lord, we pray thee, that this oblation may in such wise
      cleanse us from all our sins: that we thy servants, being sanctified
      both in body and soul, may worthily offer unto thee this our
      sacrifice. Through. <BR>
<BR>
      <B>COMMUNION. <I>Ps</I>. 20. </B>We will rejoice in thy salvation:
      and triumph in the Name of the Lord our God.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR>
      Grant, we beseech thee, O Lord, that this holy Sacrament, whereof
      we have been made partakers, may cleans us from all our sins,
      and bring us in the end unto thy heavenly kingdom. Through.<BR>
<BR>
      <I>Over the people. </I>Let us pray. Bow down before the Lord.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR>
      Have mercy, O Lord, we pray thee, upon us thy people: that we,
      which are sore vexed by many and great tribulations, by the comfort
      of thy grace may be relieved. Through.<BR>
