      </I>INTROIT. <I>Invocabit me. Ps.</I> 91.<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>HE shall call on me and
      I will hearken unto him: I will deliver him and baring him to
      honour: with length of days will I satisfy him. <I>Ps. ibid.
      </I>Whoso dwelleth under the defence of the Most High: shall
      abide under the shadow of the Almighty. V. Glory be. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      O LORD, who for our sake didst fast forty days and forty nights:
      give us grace to use such abstinence, that, our flesh being subdued
      to the Spirit, we may ever obey thy godly motions in righteousness
      and true holiness, to thy honour and glory. [Who.] <BR />
<BR />
      <B>EPISTLE. 2 Corinthians 6:1-10<BR />
      </B>1 We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also
      that ye receive not the grace of God in vain. <BR />
      2 (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in
      the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the
      accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.) <BR />
      3 Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:
<BR />
      4 But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God,
      in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,
<BR />
      5 In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings,
      in fastings; <BR />
      6 By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by
      the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned, <BR />
      7 By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of
      righteousness on the right hand and on the left, <BR />
      8 By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as
      deceivers, and yet true; <BR />
      9 As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live;
      as chastened, and not killed; <BR />
      10 As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many
      rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps. </I>91<I>.</I></B> He shall give his Angels
      charge over thee: to keep thee in all thy ways. V. They shall
      bear thee in their hands: that thou hurt not thy foot against
      a stone. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>TRACT.</B> <B><I>ibid</I></B><I>. </I>Whoso dwelleth under
      the defence of the Most High: shall abide under the shadow of
      the Almighty. V. I will say unto the Lord: Thou art my hope,
      and my stronghold: my God, in him will I trust. V. For he shall
      deliver thee from the snare of the hunter: and from the noisome
      pestilence. V. He shall defend thee under his wings, and thou
      shalt be safe under his feathers. V. His faithfulness and truth
      shall be thy shield and buckler: Thou shalt not be afraid for
      any terror by night. V. Nor for the arrow that flieth by day:
      for the pestilence that walketh in darkness, nor for the sickness
      that destroyeth in the noon-day. V. A thousand shall fall beside
      thee, and ten thousand at thy right hand: but it shall not come
      nigh thee. V. For he shall give his angels charge over thee:
      to keep thee in all thy ways. V. They shall bear thee in their
      hands; that thou hurt not thy foot against a stone. V. Thou shalt
      go upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt
      thou tread under thy feet. V. Because he hath set his love upon
      me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him up, because
      he hath known my Name. V. He shall call upon me, and I will hear
      him: yea, I am with him in trouble. V. I will deliver him, and
      bring him to honour: with long life will I satisfy him: and show
      him my salvation.<BR />

      <B>GOSPEL. <I>Saint Matthew </I>4:1-11<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>1 AT that time: then was
      Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted
      of the devil. <BR />
      2 And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was
      afterward an hungered. <BR />
      3 And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son
      of God, command that these stones be made bread. <BR />
      4 But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live
      by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the
      mouth of God. <BR />
      5 Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth
      him on a pinnacle of the temple, <BR />
      6 And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself
      down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning
      thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any
      time thou dash thy foot against a stone. <BR />
      7 Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt
      the Lord thy God. <BR />
      8 Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain,
      and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory
      of them; <BR />
      9 And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou
      wilt fall down and worship me. <BR />
      10 Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is
      written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt
      thou serve. <BR />
      11 Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered
      unto him. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps. </I>91.<I> </I></B>The Lord shall defend
      thee under his wings, and thou shalt be safe under his feathers:
      his faithfulness and truth shall be thy shield and buckler. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>SECRET</B>.<BR />
      GRANT, we beseech thee, O Lord, that we which offer unto thee
      this sacrifice in the beginning of our fast, may use such abstinence
      from carnal feastings, that we may likewise refrain ourselves
      from all pleasures that may hurt the soul. Through. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>COMMUNION. <I>Ps </I>78.<I> </I></B>They did eat and were
      well filled, for the Lord gave them their own desire: they were
      not disappointed of their lust. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      GRANT, O Lord, that this holy Sacrament, which we have received:
      may in such wise deliver us from our former nature; that we may
      be worthy to enter into the fellowship of thy saving mysteries.
      Through.</P>
