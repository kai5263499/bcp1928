    <p><b>INTROIT. <i>Ecce Deus. Ps. 54.<br />
      </i></b>BEHOLD, God is my helper,the
      Lord is with them that uphold my soul: reward thou evil unto
      mine enemies: and destroy thou them in thy truth, O Lord my defender. <i>Ps. ibid.</i> Save me, O God, for thy Name's sake : and avenge
      me in thy strength. V.Glory be.</p>
    <p><b>COLLECT</b>.<br />
      GRANT to us, Lord, we beseech thee, the spirit to think and do
      always such things as are right: that, we who cannot do any thing
      that is good without thee, may by thee be enabled to live according
      to thy will; through Jesus Christ our Lord. AMEN.</p>
    <p><b><i>EPISTLE.</i> 1 Corinthians 10:1-13</b><br />
      1 BRETHREN: I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that
      all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through
      the sea;<br />
      2 And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;<br />
      3 And did all eat the same spiritual meat;<br />
      4 And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank
      of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was
      Christ.<br />
      5 But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were
      overthrown in the wilderness.<br />
      6 Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should
      not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.<br />
      7 Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written,
      The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.<br />
      8 Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed,
      and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.<br />
      9 Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted,
      and were destroyed of serpents.<br />
      10 Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were
      destroyed of the destroyer.<br />
      11 Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and
      they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the
      world are come.<br />
      12 Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest
      he fall.<br />
      13 There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to
      man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted
      above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make
      a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.</p>
    <p><b>GRADUAL. <i>Ps. </i>9. </b>O Lord our Governour, how excellent
      is thy Name in all the world. V. Thou that hast set thy glory
      above the heavens.<br />
      Alleluia. alleluia. V. Ps. 59. Deliver me from mine enemies,
      O God: defend me from them that rise up against me. Alleluia.</p>
    <p><b>GOSPEL. <i>St. Luke 15:11-32</i></b><br />
      11 AT that time: JESUS said:
      A certain man had two sons:<br />
      12 And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me
      the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto
      them his living.<br />
      13 And not many days after the younger son gathered all together,
      and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his
      substance with riotous living.<br />
      14 And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in
      that land; and he began to be in want.<br />
      15 And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country;
      and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.<br />
      16 And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that
      the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.<br />
      17 And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants
      of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with
      hunger!<br />
      18 I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father,
      I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,<br />
      19 And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one
      of thy hired servants.<br />
      20 And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet
      a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and
      ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.<br />
      21 And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven,
      and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.<br />
      22 But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best
      robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes
      on his feet:<br />
      23 And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us
      eat, and be merry:<br />
      24 For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost,
      and is found. And they began to be merry.<br />
      25 Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew
      nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing.<br />
      26 And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things
      meant.<br />
      27 And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father
      hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe
      and sound.<br />
      28 And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his
      father out, and entreated him.<br />
      29 And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years
      do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment:
      and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with
      my friends:<br />
      30 But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured
      thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted
      calf.<br />
      31 And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all
      that I have is thine.<br />
      32 It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this
      thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is
      found.</p>
    <p><b>OFFERTORY. <i>Ps. </i>19</b>. The statutes of the Lord
      are right, and rejoice the heart, sweeter also than honey, and
      the honeycomb: and moreover thy servant keepeth them.</p>
    <p><b>SECRET.</b><br />
      ACCEPT, O Lord, we pray thee, the gifts which of thine own bounty
      we do offer unto thee: that by the powerful operation of thy
      grace these holy mysteries may sanctify our conversation in this
      life present, and bring us in the end to everlasting felicity.
      [ Through.]</p>
    <p><b>COMMUNION. St<i>. John 6.</i></b><i> </i>He that eateth
      my Flesh and drinketh my Blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him,
      saith the Lord.</p>
    <p><b>POSTCOMMUNION</b>.<br />
      GRANT, O Lord, we pray thee, that these heavenly mysteries may
      renew us both in body and soul: that we which have therein offered
      unto thee our outward worship, may inwardly feel the effectual
      benefit of the same. [Through.]</p>
