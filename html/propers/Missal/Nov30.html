      <P><B>INTROIT. <I>Mihi autem nimis. Ps. </I>139.</B><BR />
      RIGHT dear are thy friends unto me, O Lord, and held in highest
      honour: their rule and governance is exceeding stedfast. <I>Ps.
      ibid. </I>Lord, thou hast searched me out, and known me: thou
      knowest my downsitting and mine uprising. V. Glory be.</P>

      <P><BR />
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      ALMIGHTY God, who didst give such grace unto thy holy Apostle
      Saint Andrew, that he readily obeyed the calling of thy Son Jesus
      Christ, and followed him without delay; Grant unto us all, that
      we, being called by thy holy Word, may forthwith give up ourselves
      obediently to fulfil thy holy commandments; through the same
      Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><B>EPISTLE. <FONT COLOR="#000000">Romans 10:9-21<BR />
      </FONT></B>9 BRETHREN: if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the
      Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised
      him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. <BR />
      10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with
      the mouth confession is made unto salvation. <BR />
      11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall
      not be ashamed. <BR />
      12 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek:
      for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.
<BR />
      13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be
      saved. <BR />
      14 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?
      and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?
      and how shall they hear without a preacher? <BR />
      15 And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written,
      How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of
      peace, and bring glad tidings of good things! <BR />
      16 But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith,
      Lord, who hath believed our report? <BR />
      17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of
      God. <BR />
      18 But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went
      into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.
<BR />
      19 But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will
      provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a
      foolish nation I will anger you. <BR />
      20 But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that
      sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after
      me. <BR />
      21 But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth
      my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.</P>

      <P><B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps. </I>45. </B>Thou shalt make them princes
      in all lands: they shall remember thy Name, O Lord. V. Instead
      of thy fathers thou shalt have children: therefore shall the
      people give thanks unto thee. <BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. The Lord loved Andrew as a sweet savour.
      Alleluia.</P>

      <P><B>The Gospel. St Matthew 4:18-22<BR />
      </B><FONT COLOR="#000000">18 AT that time: Jesus, walking by
      the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and
      Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were
      fishers. <BR />
      19 And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers
      of men. <BR />
      20 And they straightway left their nets, and followed him. <BR />
      21 And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James
      the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee
      their father, mending their nets; and he called them. <BR />
      22 And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed
      him.</FONT></P>

      <P><B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps. </I>139. </B>Right dear are thy friends

      O LORD, we pray thee that the devout prayers of thy blessed Apostle
      Saint Andrew may commend our sacrifice unto thee: that this bounden
      oblation which we offer in his honour, may by his merits be rendered
      acceptable in thy sight. Through.</P>

      <P>PREFACE <I>of the Apostles.</I></P>

      <P><B>COMMUNION. <I>St. Matthew 4</I>. </B>Follow me, and I will
      make you fishers of men: and they straightway left their nets
      and followed the Lord.</P>

      <P><B>POSTCOMMUNION</B>.<BR />
      WE beseech thee, O Lord, that these heavenly mysteries, which
      we have joyfully received on this festival of blessed Andrew
      thine Apostle: may effectually avail for the glory of thy Saints;
      and the forgiveness of the sins of us thy servants. Through.</P>
