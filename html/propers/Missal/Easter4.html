      <P><B>INTROIT. <I>Cantate Domino. Ps. 98 </I></B><BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /> O SING unto the Lord a new
      song, alleluia: for the Lord hath done marvellous things, alleluia:
      his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen,
      alleluia, alleluia, alleluia. <I>Ps. ibid. </I>With his own right
      hand and with his holy arm: hath he gotten himself the victory.
      V. Glory be.</P>

      <P><B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      O ALMIGHTY GOD, who alone canst order the unruly wills and affections
      of sinful men: grant unto thy people that they may love the thing
      which thou commandest, and desire that which thou dost promise;
      that so, among the sundry and manifold changes of the world our
      hearts may surely there be fixed, where true joys are to be found.
      [Through.]</P>

      <P><I>Seasonal Prayers as given after Low Sunday.</I></P>

      <P><B>EPISTLE.<I> St. James 1:17-21<BR />
      </I></B>17 DEARLY beloved: Every good gift and every perfect
      gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights,
      with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.<BR />
      18 Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we
      should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.<BR />
      19 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to
      hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:<BR />
      20 For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.<BR />
      21 Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness,
      and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to
      save your souls.</P>

      <P>Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>Psalm 118 </I>The right hand of
      the Lord hath the pre-eminence: the right hand of the Lord bringeth
      might things to pass. Alleluia. V. <I>Rom 6, 9. </I>Christ being
      raised from the dead dieth no more: death hath no more dominion
      over him. Alleluia.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>Saint John 16:5-15</I></B><BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /> 5 AT that time, Jesus said
      unto His disciples: Now I go my way to him that sent me; and
      none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?<BR />
      6 But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath
      filled your heart.<BR />
      7 Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you
      that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not
      come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.<BR />
      8 And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and
      of righteousness, and of judgment:<BR />
      9 Of sin, because they believe not on me;<BR />
      10 Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me
      no more;<BR />
      11 Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.<BR />
      12 I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear
      them now.<BR />
      13 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide
      you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever
      he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things
      to come.<BR />
      14 He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall
      show it unto you.<BR />
      15 All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I,
      that he shall take of mine, and shall show it unto you.</P>

      <P><B>OFFERTORY.</B> <B><I>Psalm 66 </I></B>O be joyful in God,
      all ye lands, sing praises unto the honour of his Name: O come
      hither, and hearken, all ye that fear God, and I will tell you
      what the Lord hath done for my soul. Alleluia.</P>

      <P><B>SECRET.</B><BR />
      O GOD, who by the wondrous operation of this sacrifice, hast
      made us partakers of thy glorious Godhead: grant, we beseech
      thee, that we which are taught the knowledge of thy truth, may
      in all our conversation walk worthily of the same. [Through.]</P>

      <P><B>COMMUNION. <I>St. John 16.</I></B> When the Comforter,
      the Spirit of Truth, is come, he will reprove the world of sin,
      and of righteousness, and of judgement, alleluia, alleluia.</P>

      <P><B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      ASSIST us mercifully, O Lord our God: that we, which have in
      faithfulness received this holy Sacrament, may thereby be cleansed
      from all our iniquities, and delivered from all dangers that
      beset us. [Through.]<BR />
