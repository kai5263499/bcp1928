      1 And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying,<BR>
      2 Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it
      the preaching that I bid thee.<BR>
      3 So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word
      of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three
      days' journey.<BR>
      4 And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and
      he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.<BR>
      5 So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast,
      and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least
      of them.<BR>
      6 For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his
      throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth,
      and sat in ashes.<BR>
      7 And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh
      by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither
      man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not
      feed, nor drink water:<BR>
      8 But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily
      unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and
      from the violence that is in their hands.<BR>
      9 Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from
      his fierce anger, that we perish not?<BR>
      10 And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil
      way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would
      do unto them; and he did it not.</FONT></P>

      such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests
      sent officers to take him.<BR>
      33 Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you,
      and then I go unto him that sent me.<BR>
      34 Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither
      ye cannot come.<BR>
      35 Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that
      we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the
      Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?<BR>
      36 What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek
      me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot
      come?<BR>
      37 In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood
      and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and

      his belly shall flow rivers of living water.<BR>
