      INTROIT. <I>Reminiscere. Ps. </I>25<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>CALL to remembrance, O
      Lord, thy tender mercies, and thy loving-kindnesses, which have
      been ever of old: O let not our enemies triumph over us: deliver
      us, O God of Israel, out of all our troubles. Unto thee, O Lord,
      will I lift up my soul: O my God, I have put my trust in thee,
      O let me not be confounded. V. Glory be. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      ALMIGHTY God, who seest that we have no power of ourselves to
      help ourselves: keep us both outwardly in our bodies, and inwardly
      in our souls; that we may be defended from all adversities which
      may happen to the body, and from all evil thoughts which may
      assault and hurt the soul. Through Jesus Christ our Lord. AMEN.
<BR />
<BR />
      <B>EPISTLE. 1<I> Thessalonians </I>4:1-8<BR />
      </B>1 BRETHREN: we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the
      Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk
      and to please God, so ye would abound more and more. <BR />
      2 For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.
<BR />
      3 For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that
      ye should abstain from fornication: <BR />
      4 That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel
      in sanctification and honour; <BR />
      5 Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which
      know not God: <BR />
      6 That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter:
      because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also
      have forewarned you and testified. <BR />
      7 For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.
<BR />
      8 He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who
      hath also given unto us his holy Spirit. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps </I>25. </B>The sorrows of my heart are enlarged:
      O bring thou me out of my troubles, O Lord. V. Look upon my adversity
      and misery: and forgive me all my sin.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>TRACT. <I>Ps. </I>106.</B> O give thanks unto the Lord, for
      he is gracious: and his mercy endureth for ever. V. Who can express
      the noble acts of the Lord: or shew forth all his praise? V.
      Blessed are they that always keep judgement and do righteousness.
      V. Remember me, O Lord, according to thy favour that thou bearest
      unto thy people: O visit me with thy salvation. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>Saint Matthew </I>15:21-28<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>21 AT that time: Jesus
      went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.
<BR />
      22 And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts,
      and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son
      of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. <BR />
      23 But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and
      besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.
<BR />
      24 But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost
      sheep of the house of Israel. <BR />
      25 Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. <BR />
      26 But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's
      bread, and cast it to dogs. <BR />
      27 And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs
      which fall from their masters' table. <BR />
      28 Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy
      faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was
      made whole from that very hour. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps </I>119.<I> </I></B>My delight shall be in
      thy commandments which I have loved exceedingly: my hands also
      will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>SECRET.<BR />
      </B>WE BESEECH thee, O Lord, mercifully to have respect unto
      these our oblations: that the same may be profitable unto us
      for our increase in all godliness, and for the advancement of
      everlasting salvation. Through. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>COMMUNION. <I>Ps. </I>5.</B><I> </I>Consider my meditation:
      hearken thou unto the voice of my calling, my King and my God:
      for unto thee will I make my prayer, O Lord. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      WE humbly beseech thee, Almighty God: that we whom thou dost
      vouchsafe to regenerate with thy holy sacraments; may continually
      serve thee in all virtuous and godly living. Through.</P>
