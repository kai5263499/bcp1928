      INTROIT. <I>Circumdederunt. Psalm </I>18<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>THE sorrows of death compassed
      me, the pains of hell gat hold upon me: and in my tribulation
      I made my prayer unto the Lord, and he regarded my supplication
      out of his holy temple. I will love thee, O Lord my strength:
      the Lord is my stony rock, my fortress, and my Saviour. V. Glory
      be. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      O LORD, we beseech thee favourably to hear the prayers of thy
      people: that we, who are justly punished for our offences, may
      be mercifully delivered by thy goodness, for the glory of thy
      Name. [Through.]<BR />
<BR />
      <B>EPISTLE. 1<I> Corinthians </I>9:24-27<BR />
      </B>24 Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but
      one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain. <BR />
      25 And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in
      all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but
      we an incorruptible. <BR />
      26 I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as
      one that beateth the air: <BR />
      27 But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest
      that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should
      be a castaway. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps</I> 9.</B><I> </I>The Lord will be a refuge
      in the time of trouble: and they that know thy Name will put
      their trust in thee: for thou, Lord, hast never failed them that
      seek thee. V. For the poor shall not always be forgotten: the
      patient abiding of the meek shall not perish for ever: up Lord,
      and let not man have the upper hand.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>TRACT. <I>Ps</I> 130.</B> Out of the deep have I called unto
      thee, O Lord: Lord hear my voice. V. O let thine ears consider
      well: the voice of my complaint. V. If thou, Lord, wilt be extreme
      to mark what is done amiss: O Lord, who may abide it? V. For
      there is mercy with thee: therefore shalt thou be feared. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>Saint Matthew </I>20:1-15<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>1 THE kingdom of heaven
      is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early
      in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard. <BR />
      2 And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day,
      he sent them into his vineyard. <BR />
      3 And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing
      idle in the marketplace, <BR />
      4 And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever
      is right I will give you. And they went their way. <BR />
      5 Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.
<BR />
      6 And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing
      idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?
<BR />
      7 They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto
      them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right,
      that shall ye receive. <BR />
      8 So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto
      his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning
      from the last unto the first. <BR />
      9 And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour,
      they received every man a penny. <BR />
      10 But when the first came, they supposed that they should have
      received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.
<BR />
      11 And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman
      of the house, <BR />
      12 Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast
      made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat
      of the day. <BR />
      13 But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no
      wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny? <BR />
      14 Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this
      last, even as unto thee. <BR />
      15 Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is
      thine eye evil, because I am good? <BR />
      16 So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be
      called, but few chosen. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>OFFERTORY. <I>Psalm</I> 92:1.</B> It is a good thing to give
      thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto thy Name, O Most
      Highest. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>SECRET.<BR />
      </B>WE beseech thee, O Lord, graciously to accept these our prayers
      and oblations: that we being cleansed by these heavenly mysteries,
      may obtain of thy great mercy the fulfilment of all our desires.
      Through. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>COMMUNION. <I>Psalm </I>31.</B> Shew thy servant the light
      of thy countenance, and save me for thy mercy's sake: let me
      not be confounded, O Lord, for I have called upon thee.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      STRENGTHEN, O Lord, we pray thee, with these thy gifts the wills
      of thy faithful people: that we receiving the same may seek them
      more earnestly, and seeking the same may obtain them everlastingly.
      [Through.] <BR />
