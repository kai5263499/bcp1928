    <p><b>INTROIT. <i>Si iniquitates. Ps. </i>130 </b><br />
      IF THOU, O Lord, wilt be
      extreme to mark what is done amiss, O Lord, who may abide it?
      For there is mercy with thee, O God of Israel. <i>Ps. ibid.</i> Out of the deep have I called unto thee, O Lord: Lord hear my
      voice. V. Glory be.</p>
    <p><b>COLLECT.<br />
      </b>LORD, we beseech thee to keep thy household the Church in
      continual godliness; that through thy protection it may be free
      from all adversities, and devoutly given to serve thee in good
      works, to the glory of thy Name. Through Jesus Christ our Lord.
      [Who.]</p>
    <p><b>EPISTLE. <i>Philippians 1:3-11<br />
      </i></b>3 I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, <br />
      4 Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with
      joy, <br />
      5 For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until
      now; <br />
      6 Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun
      a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ: <br />
      7 Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because
      I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in
      the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers
      of my grace. <br />
      8 For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the
      bowels of Jesus Christ. <br />
      9 And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more
      in knowledge and in all judgment; <br />
      10 That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may
      be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ; <br />
      11 Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by
      Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.</p>
    <p><b>GRADUAL. <i>Ps. </i>133.</b> Behold, how good and joyful
      a thing it is, brethren, to dwell together in unity. V. It is
      like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down unto
      the beard, even unto Aaron's beard.<br />
      Alleluia, alleluia. v. <i>Ps. </i>115. Ye that fear the Lord,
      put your trust in the Lord: he is their helper and defender.
      Alleluia.</p>
    <p><b>GOSPEL. <i>St. Matthew 18:21-35<br />
      </i></b> 21 Then came Peter to him,
      and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and
      I forgive him? till seven times? <br />
      22 Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times:
      but, Until seventy times seven. <br />
      23 Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain
      king, which would take account of his servants. <br />
      24 And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him,
      which owed him ten thousand talents. <br />
      25 But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him
      to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had,
      and payment to be made. <br />
      26 The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying,
      Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. <br />
      27 Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and
      loosed him, and forgave him the debt. <br />
      28 But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants,
      which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and
      took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest. <br />
      29 And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought
      him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. <br />
      30 And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till
      he should pay the debt. <br />
      31 So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very
      sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done. <br />
      32 Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him,
      O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because
      thou desiredst me: <br />
      33 Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant,
      even as I had pity on thee? <br />
      34 And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors,
      till he should pay all that was due unto him. <br />
      35 So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if
      ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.</p>
    <p><b>OFFERTORY. <i>Esth. </i>14.</b> Remember me, O Lord, King
      of all power: and give me eloquent speech in my mouth that my
      words may be pleasing at thy sight.</p>
    <p><b>SECRET.<br />
      </b>O LORD, who has ordained this sacrifice to be the propitiation
      for our sins, and the means whereby of thy loving-kindness we
      are restored unto salvation: mercifully grant that these our
      oblations may be acceptable in thy sight. [Through.]</p>
    <p><b>COMMUNION. <i>Ps. </i>17.</b> I have called upon thee,
      O God, for thou shalt hear me: incline thine ear to me, and hearken
      unto my words.</p>
    <p><b>POSTCOMMUNION.<br />
      </b>O LORD, who hast vouchsafed to bestow upon us the sustenance
      of everlasting life: we humbly beseech thee that those things
      which we have received with our outward lips, we may ever inwardly
      seek in purity of heart. [Through.]</p>
