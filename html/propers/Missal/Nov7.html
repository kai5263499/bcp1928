      O GOD, who didst vouuchsafe to send thy blessed Saint Willibrord
      to preach thy glory to the Gentiles: we humbly pray thee; that,

      things which we ought to do, and by thy mercy be enaabled to
      perform the same. Through.</P>

      </I><B>For the Epistle. <FONT COLOR="#000000">Ecclesiasticus
      44:16</FONT></B><BR />
      Behold a great priest who in his days pleased the Lord and was
      found righteous: and in the time of wrath he was taken in exchange
      for the world. There was none like unto him to keep the law of
      the Most High. Therefore by an oath the Lord assured him that
      he would increase him among his people. He established with him
      the blessing of all men and the covenant, and made it rest upon
      his head. He acknowledged him in his blessing: and preserved
      for him his mercy: so that he found favour in the sight of the
      Lord. He magnified him in the sight of kings: and gave unto him
      a crown of glory. An everlasting covenant he made with him and
      gave him a great priesthood and blessed him with glory, that
      he should execute the office of the priesthood and have honour
      in his name and offer unto him incense and a sweet savour.</P>

      <P><B>GRADUAL. <I>Ecclus. </I>44.</B> Behold a great priest who
      in his days pleased the Lord. V. There was none like unto him
      to keep the law of the Most High.<BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>Ps. </I>110. Thou art a priest for
      ever after the order of Melchisedech. Alleluia.</P>

      <P><I>After Septuagesima, instead of the Alleluia and verse following,
      is said:</I></P>

      <P><B>TRACT. <I>Ps. </I>112. </B>Blessed is the man that feareth
      the Lord: he hath great delight in his commandments. V. His seed
      shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the faithful shall
      be blessed. V. Riches and plenteousness shall be in his house:
      and his righteousness endureth for ever.</P>

      <P><I>In Eastertide, instead of the Gradual, is said:</I></P>

      <P>Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>Ps. </I>110. Thou art a priest for
      ever after the order of Melchisedech. Alleluia. V. This is a
      priest whom the Lord hath crowned. Alleluia.</P>

      <P><B>The Gospel. St Matthew 25:14<BR />
      </B><FONT COLOR="#000000">14 AT that time: Jesus spake this parable
      unto his disciples: the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling
      into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered
      unto them his goods.<BR />
      15 And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to
      another one; to every man according to his several ability; and
      straightway took his journey.<BR />
      16 Then he that had received the five talents went and traded
      with the same, and made them other five talents.<BR />
      17 And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other
      two.<BR />
      18 But he that had received one went and digged in the earth,
      and hid his lord's money.<BR />
      19 After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth
      with them.<BR />
      20 And so he that had received five talents came and brought
      other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five
      talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.<BR />
      21 His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful
      servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make
      thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.<BR />
      22 He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord,
      thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two
      other talents beside them.<BR />
      23 His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant;
      thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler
      over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</FONT></P>
