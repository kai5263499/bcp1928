      <B>LESSON. <I>Genesis </I>37:6-22</B><BR>
      6. In those days : Joseph said unto his brethren: Hear, I pray
      you, this dream which I have dreamed: <BR>
      7 For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo,
      my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves
      stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf. <BR>
      8 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over
      us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated
      him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words. <BR>
      9 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren,
      and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the
      sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me. <BR>
      10 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his
      father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that
      thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed
      come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth? <BR>
      11 And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.
<BR>
      12 And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.
<BR>
      13 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the
      flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he
      said to him, Here am I. <BR>
      14 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well
      with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word
      again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came
      to Shechem. <BR>
      15 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering
      in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?
<BR>
      16 And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where
      they feed their flocks. <BR>
      17 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them
      say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren,
      and found them in Dothan. <BR>
      18 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto
      them, they conspired against him to slay him. <BR>
      19 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.
<BR>
      20 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into
      some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him:
      and we shall see what will become of his dreams. <BR>
      21 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands;
      and said, Let us not kill him. <BR>
      22 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into
      this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him;
      that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his
      father again.</P>

      <P><B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps</I>. </B>120. When I was in trouble, I called
      upon the Lord, and he heard me. V. Deliver my soul, O Lord, from
      lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue.</P>

      <P><B>TRACT. <I>Ps</I>. 103. </B>O Lord, deal not with us after
      our sins; nor reward us according to wickednesses. V. Ps. 79.
      Lord, remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and
      that soon: for we are come to great misery. V. <I>(Here genuflect.)</I>
      Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name, O
      Lord: O deliver us and be merciful unto our sins, for thy Name's
      sake.</P>

      <B>GOSPEL. <I>St.</I> <I>Matthew </I>21:33-46</B><BR>
      33<B><FONT SIZE="-1"><IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></FONT></B>At
      that time : Jesus spake this parable unto the multitudes of the
      Jews and the chief priests: There was a certain householder,
      which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged
      a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen,
      and went into a far country: <BR>
      34 And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants
      to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.
<BR>
      35 And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed
      another, and stoned another. <BR>
      36 Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they
      did unto them likewise. <BR>
      37 But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will
      reverence my son. <BR>
      38 But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves,
      This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on
      his inheritance. <BR>
      39 And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and
      slew him. <BR>
      40 When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will
      he do unto those husbandmen? <BR>
      41 They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked
      men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which
      shall render him the fruits in their seasons. <BR>
      42 Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures,
      The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the
      head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous
      in our eyes? <BR>
      43 Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken
      from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.
<BR>
      44 And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but
      on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder. <BR>
      45 And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables,
      they perceived that he spake of them. <BR>
      46 But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the
      multitude, because they took him for a prophet.</P>

      <P><B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps</I>. 40. </B>Make haste, O Lord, to help
      me: let them be ashamed and confounded together, that seek after
      my soul to destroy it: make haste, O Lord, to help me.</P>

      <P><B>SECRET.</B><BR>
      Grant, O Lord, we pray thee, that this holy sacrifice may continually
      work in us to good effect, and be strengthened in the power of
      its operation. through.</P>

      <P><B>COMMUNION. <I>Ps</I>. 12.</B> thou shalt keep us O Lord
      : thou shalt preserve us from the generation for ever.</P>

      <P><B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR>
      O Lord, who hast bestowed on us these pledges of our salvation
      : grant us, we pray thee, that we may so walk worthily of the
      same that we may attain unto their fulfillment in everlasting
      life. Through.</P>

      <P><I>Over the people. </I>Let us pray. Bow down before the Lord.</P>

      <P><B>COLLECT.</B><BR>
      Keep, we beseech thee, O Lord, thy faithful people both outwardly
      in their bodies and inwardly in their souls : that they, cleaving
      stedfastly to all good works, may ever be defended by thy mighty
      power. through.</P>
