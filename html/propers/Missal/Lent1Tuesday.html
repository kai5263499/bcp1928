      thou hast been our refuge from one generation to another : thou
      art from everlasting, and world without end.&nbsp;<I> Ps. ibid.</I>&nbsp;
      Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and
      the world were made : thou art God from everlasting, and world
      without end.&nbsp; V.&nbsp; Glory be.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR>
      We beseech thee, O Lord, graciously to behold this thy family:
      that, whereas we now do&nbsp; chasten our bodies by the mortifying
      of the flesh, our souls may shine in thy sight with longing after
      thee.&nbsp; Through.<BR>

      <I>Seasonal Prayers as on Ash Wednesday.</I><BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>EPISTLE. <I>Isaiah</I> 55:6-11.</B><BR>
      &nbsp;6 IN those days: Isaiah the Prophet spake, saying: Seek
      ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he
      is near: <BR>
      7 Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his
      thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have
      mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.
<BR>
      8 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways
      my ways, saith the LORD. <BR>
      9 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways
      higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. <BR>
      10 For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and
      returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it
      bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and
      bread to the eater: <BR>
      11 So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall
      not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I
      please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it:
      saith the Lord Almighty.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps</I>. 141.&nbsp;</B> Let my prayer be set forth
      in thy sight as the incense, O Lord,&nbsp; V. And let the lifting
      up of my hands be an evening sacrifice.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>St Matthew </I>21:10-17<BR>
      <FONT SIZE="-1"><IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></FONT></B>10
      AT that time: When JESUS was come into Jerusalem, all the city
      was moved, saying, Who is this? <BR>
      11 And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth
      of Galilee. <BR>
      12 And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them
      that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables
      of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,
<BR>
      13 And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called
      the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves. <BR>
      14 And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and
      he healed them. <BR>
      15 And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things
      that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying,
      Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore displeased, <BR>
      16 And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus
      saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of
      babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise? <BR>
      17 And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and
      he lodged there. <BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps</I>. 31.&nbsp; </B>My hope hath been in thee,
      O Lord: I have said: Thou art my God, my times are in thy hand.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>SECRET.</B><BR>
      We beseech thee, O Lord, mercifully to have respect unto these
      our oblations: and by thy power to defend us against all adversities.&nbsp;
      Through.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>COMMUNION.&nbsp; <I>Ps</I>. 4.&nbsp;</B> thou hast heard me
      when I called, O God of my righteousness: thou hast set me at
      liberty when I was in trouble: have mercy upon me, and hearken
      unto my prayer.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR>
      Grant, we beseech thee, Almighty God: that as in these holy mysteries
      we have received the token of our redemption, so we may effectually
      be brought to the fulfilment of the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; Through.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <I>Over the people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> Let us pray.&nbsp; Bow down
      before the Lord.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR>
      Grant, we beseech thee, O Lord, that our prayers may in such
      manner ascend unto thee: that thy Church may by thee be defended
      against all the assaults of iniquity.&nbsp;&nbsp; Through.<FONT SIZE="+1"><BR>
