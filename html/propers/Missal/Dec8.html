      <B>INTROIT. <I>Gaudens gaudebo. Is. </I>61:10.<BR />
      </B>I WILL greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful
      in my God: for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation:
      he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bride
      adorneth herself with jewels. <I>Ps. </I>30. I will magnify thee,
      O Lord, for thou hast set me up: and not made my foes to triumph
      over me. V. Glory be.<BR />

      <P><B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      O GOD, who in the foreknowledge of thy Son's most precious death
      didst consecrate for him a dwelling-place by the spotless Conception
      of the Blessed Virgin: mercifully grant that she who was preserved
      from all defilement; may evermore pray for us until we attain
      unto thee in purity of heart. [Through the same]</P>

      <B>For the Epistle. Proverbs 8:22-35</B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      22 The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before
      his works of old.<BR />
      23 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever
      the earth was.<BR />
      24 When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there
      were no fountains abounding with water.<BR />
      25 Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I
      brought forth:<BR />
      26 While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor
      the highest part of the dust of the world.<BR />
      27 When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass
      upon the face of the depth:<BR />
      28 When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened
      the fountains of the deep:<BR />
      29 When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should
      not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of
      the earth:<BR />
      30 Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily
      his delight, rejoicing always before him;<BR />
      31 Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights
      were with the sons of men.<BR />
      32 Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed
      are they that keep my ways.<BR />
      33 Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.<BR />
      34 Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates,
      waiting at the posts of my doors.<BR />
      35 For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour
      of the LORD.</FONT></P>

      <P><B>GOSPEL. St Luke 1:26-28</B><BR />
      26 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God
      unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,<BR />
      27 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the
      house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.<BR />
      28 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that
      art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou
      among women.</P>

      <P><B>OFFERTORY. <I>St. Luke </I>1. </B>Hail, Mary, full of grace:
      the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women, alleluia.</P>

      <P><B>SECRET.</B><BR />
      ACCEPT, O Lord, the sacrifice of our salvation, which we offer
      unto thee on this feast of the Conception of the Blessed Virgin
      Mary: and grant that, like as we do confess her by the prevention
      of thy grace to have been preserved from every stain of sin;
      so by her intercession we may be delivered from all our iniquities.
      Through.</P>

      <P><B>PREFACE</B> <I>of our Lady, </I>And that on the Conception,
      <I>which is said throughout the whole Octave, even on Feast occurring
      therein, save in Masses of the Season, or on Feasts requiring
      another Preface</I></P>

      <P><B>COMMUNION. </B>Glorious things of thee are spoken, O Mary:
      because he that is might hath magnified thee.</P>

      <P><B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      O LORD, who in her Conception didst wondrously preserve the Blessed
      Virgin Mary from all sin: grant, we beseech thee; that the Sacrament,
      which we have received, may heal in us the wounds of the sins
      which we have committed. Through.</P>

      <P><I>&para; Within the Octave and on the Octave Day itself Mass
      is said as on the Feast, but within the Octave Collect 2 is of
      the Feria, but Collect 3, if there be no commemoration of a simple
      Feast, or of a Feast treated as such, is of the Holy Ghost (or
      of Advent Sunday)</I></P>
