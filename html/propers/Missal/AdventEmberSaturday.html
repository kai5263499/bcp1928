      21 And the LORD shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall
      know the LORD in that day, and shall do sacrifice and oblation;
      yea, they shall vow a vow unto the LORD, and perform it. <BR />

      behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompence;
      he will come and save you. <BR />
      5 Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of

      loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates;
      and the gates shall not be shut; <BR />

      I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder
      the bars of iron: <BR />
      3 And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden
      riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the LORD,
      which call thee by thy name, am the God of Israel. <BR />
      4 For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, I have
      even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou
      hast not known me. <BR />
      5 I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside
      me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me: <BR />
      6 That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the
      west, that there is none beside me. I am the LORD, and there
      is none else. <BR />

      1 BRETHREN: we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord
      Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him, <BR />
      2 That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither
      by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the
      day of Christ is at hand. <BR />
      3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not
      come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of
      sin be revealed, the son of perdition; <BR />
      4 Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called
      God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the
      temple of God, showing himself that he is God. <BR />
      5 Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you
      these things? <BR />
      6 And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed
      in his time. <BR />
      7 For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who
      now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way. <BR />
      8 And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall
      consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with
      the brightness of his coming.</P>

<BR />
      2 Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God
      came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness. <BR />
      3 And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the
      baptism of repentance for the remission of sins; <BR />
      4 As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet,
      saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye
      the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. <BR />
      5 Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall
      be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the
      rough ways shall be made smooth; <BR />
      6 And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.</P>
