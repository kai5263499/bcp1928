      <P><B>INTROIT. <I>De ventre. Is. </I>49.<BR />
      </B>From the womb of my mother the Lord hath called me by my
      name: and hath made my mouth as it were a sharp sword: beneath
      the shadow of his hand hath he hidden me, and hath made me like
      to a polished arrow. <I>Ps. </I>92 It is a good thing to give
      thanks unto the Lord: and to sing praises unto thy Name, O Most
      Highest. V. Glory be.</P>

      ALMIGHTY God, by whose providence thy servant John Baptist was
      wonderfully born, and sent to prepare the way of thy Son our
      Saviour by preaching repentance; Make us so to follow his doctrine
      and holy life, that we may truly repent according to his preaching;
      and after his example constantly speak the truth, boldly rebuke
      vice, and patiently suffer for the truth's sake; through the
      same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</P>

      <P><BR />
      <B>For the Epistle. <FONT COLOR="#000000">Isaiah 40:1-11<BR />
      </FONT></B>1 Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.<BR />
      2 Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her
      warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she
      hath received of the LORD'S hand double for all her sins.<BR />
      3 The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye
      the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for
      our God.<BR />
      4 Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill
      shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and
      the rough places plain:<BR />
      5 And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh
      shall see it together: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken
      it.<BR />
      6 The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh
      is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of
      the field:<BR />
      7 The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit
      of the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people is grass.<BR />
      8 The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our
      God shall stand for ever.<BR />
      9 O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high
      mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy
      voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the
      cities of Judah, Behold your God!<BR />
      10 Behold, the Lord GOD will come with strong hand, and his arm
      shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his work
      before him.<BR />
      11 He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the
      lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently
      lead those that are with young.</P>

      <P><B>The Gospel. St Luke 1:57-80</B><BR />
      57 Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered;
      and she brought forth a son.<BR />
      58 And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had
      shown great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.<BR />
      59 And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise
      the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his
      father.<BR />
      60 And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be
      called John.<BR />
      61 And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that
      is called by this name.<BR />
      62 And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.<BR />
      63 And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name
      is John. And they marvelled all.<BR />
      64 And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed,
      and he spake, and praised God.<BR />
      65 And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all
      these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country
      of Judaea.<BR />
      66 And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts,
      saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the
      Lord was with him.<BR />
      67 And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and
      prophesied, saying,<BR />
      68 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and
      redeemed his people,<BR />
      69 And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house
      of his servant David;<BR />
      70 As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have
      been since the world began:<BR />
      71 That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand
      of all that hate us;<BR />
      72 To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember
      his holy covenant;<BR />
      73 The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,<BR />
      74 That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of
      the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,<BR />
      75 In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of
      our life.<BR />
      76 And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest:
      for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his
      ways;<BR />
      77 To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission
      of their sins,<BR />
      78 Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring
      from on high hath visited us,<BR />
      79 To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow
      of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.<BR />
      80 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in
      the deserts till the day of his showing unto Israel.</P>

      <P><B>OFFERTORY. <I>PS. </I>92. </B>The righteous shall flourish
      like a palm-tree: and shall spread abroad like a cedar in Libanus.</P>

      <P><B>SECRET.<BR />
      </B>O LORD, who didst send forth thy servant, Saint John Baptist,
      to foretell the coming, and declare the presence of the Saviour
      of the world: grant that the gifts which we do here present upon
      thine altars in honour of his wondrous birth, may be an acceptable
      offering in thy sight. Through the same.</P>

      <P><B>COMMUNION. <I>St Luke </I>1. </B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Thou,
      child, shalt be called the Prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt
      go before the face of the Lord, to prepare his ways.</FONT></P>

      <P><B>POSTCOMMUNION.<BR />
      </B>GRANT, O Lord, we pray thee: that like as thou didst send
      thy blessed Saint John Baptist to reveal unto thy Church the
      Author of its regeneration; so we thy people may evermore rejoice
      in the remembrance of his birth. Through the same.</P>
