      </I><B>INTROIT. <I>In excelso throno.<BR />
      </I><IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>On a throne exalted I
      beheld, and lo, a man sitting, whom a legion of Angels worship,
      singing together: behold, his rule and governance endureth to
      all ages. <I>Ps.</I> 100. O be joyful in God, all ye lands: serve
      the Lord with gladness. V. Glory be. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>COLLECT</B><BR />
      O Lord, we beseech thee mercifully to receive the prayers of
      thy people who call upon thee: and grant that they may both perceive
      and know what things they ought to do, and also may have grace
      and power faithfully to fulfil the same. Through Jesus Christ
      our Lord. [Who.]<BR />
<BR />
      <B>EPISTLE</B>. <B><I>Romans 12:1-5</I></B><BR />
      1 I BESEECH you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that
      ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto
      God, which is your reasonable service. <BR />
      2 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by
      the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good,
      and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. <BR />
      3 For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that
      is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought
      to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to
      every man the measure of faith. <BR />
      4 For as we have many members in one body, and all members have
      not the same office: <BR />
      5 So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members
      one of another. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>GRADUAL</B>.<B> <I>Ps.</I> 72. </B>Blessed be the Lord God,
      even the God of Israel: which only doeth wondrous things. V.
      The mountains also shall bring peace: and the little hills righteousness
      unto the people.<BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>Ps.</I> 100. O be joyful in the Lord,
      all ye lands: serve the Lord with gladness. Alleluia.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>St. Luke </I>2:41-52<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B> 41 Now his parents went
      to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover. <BR />
      42 And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem
      after the custom of the feast. <BR />
      43 And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the
      child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother
      knew not of it. <BR />
      44 But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went
      a day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and
      acquaintance. <BR />
      45 And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem,
      seeking him. <BR />
      46 And it came to pass, that after three days they found him
      in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing
      them, and asking them questions. <BR />
      47 And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding
      and answers. <BR />
      48 And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said
      unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy
      father and I have sought thee sorrowing. <BR />
      49 And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye
      not that I must be about my Father's business? <BR />
      50 And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.
<BR />
      51 And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was
      subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her
      heart. <BR />
      52 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with
      God and man. <BR />
      <I>The Creed is said.<BR />
<BR />
      </I><B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps</I>. 100. </B>O be joyful in the Lord,
      all ye lands, serve the Lord with gladness: and come before his
      presence with a song: be ye sure that the Lord he is God.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>SECRET</B>.<BR />
      We beseech thee, O Lord, that this sacrifice, which we offer
      unto thee, may evermore avail to quicken and defend us. Through.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>COMMUNION</B>.<B> <I>St. Luke 2</I></B><I>. </I>Son, why hast
      thou thus dealt with us? Behold, thy father and I have sought
      thee sorrowing. And he said unto them: How is it that ye sought
      me? Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?<BR />
<BR />
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION</B>.<BR />
      We humbly beseech thee, Almighty God: that we, whom thou dost
      vouchsafe to regenerate with thy holy sacraments; may continually
      serve thee in all virtuous and godly living. through.<BR />
