      O God, forasmuch as our fast is unprofitable unto thy loving-kindness:

      </I><B>LESSON.<I>Isaiah </I>49:8-15.</B><BR>
      8 Thus saith the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard thee,
      and in a day of salvation have I helped thee: and I will preserve
      thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to establish
      the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages; <BR>
      9 That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that
      are in darkness, Show yourselves. They shall feed in the ways,
      and their pastures shall be in all high places. <BR>
      10 They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor
      sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them,
      even by the springs of water shall he guide them. <BR>
      11 And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall
      be exalted. <BR>
      12 Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the
      north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim. <BR>
      13 Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into
      singing, O mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his people,
      and will have mercy upon his afflicted. <BR>
      14 But Zion said, The LORD hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath
      forgotten me. <BR>
      15 Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not
      have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget,
      yet will I not forget thee. <BR>
      <B><BR>
      GRADUAL. <I>Ps</I>. 10. </B>The poor committeth himself unto
      thee, O Lord: for thou art the helper of the friendless. V. Why
      standest thou so far off, O Lord, and hidest thy face in the
      needful time of trouble: the ungodly for his own lust doth persecute
      the poor.<BR>

      <B>GOSPEL. <I>St. John </I>8:12-20<BR>

      AT that time: Jesus spake unto the multitudes of the Jews, saying:
      I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk
      in darkness, but shall have the light of life. <BR>
      13 The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record
      of thyself; thy record is not true. <BR>
      14 Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of
      myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and
      whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I
      go. <BR>
      15 Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man. <BR>
      16 And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone,
      but I and the Father that sent me. <BR>
      17 It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two
      men is true. <BR>
      18 I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that
      sent me beareth witness of me. <BR>
      19 Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered,
      Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should
      have known my Father also. <BR>
      20 These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the
      temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet
      come.</P>

      <P><BR>
      <B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps</I>. 18. </B>The Lord is my stony rock, and
      my defence: my Saviour in whom I will trust.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>SECRET.</B><BR>
      Most merciful Lord, we beseech thee, to have respect unto these
      our oblations: that whereas we have rebelled and done evil against
      thee, we may by thy grace be conformed unto thy will. Through.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>COMMUNION. <I>Ps</I>. 23. </B>The Lord is my shepherd, therefore
      can I lack nothing: he shall feed me in a green pasture: and
      lead me forth beside the waters of comfort.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR>
      Grant, O Lord, we pray thee; that these holy mysteries may by
      their operation cleanse us from all our sins, and render us an
      acceptable people in thy sight. Through. <BR>
<BR>
      <I>Over the people. </I>Let us pray. Bow down before the Lord.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR>
      O God, who wouldest not be wroth with them that put their trust
      in thee, but rather shewest mercy unto them: grant unto us we
      pray thee, so rightly to bewail the sins, which we have committed,
      that we may be found worthy to obtain the comfort of thy grace.
      Through.<BR>

      <I>(Before Evensong, Crosses and any other sacred images are
      covered; and the Crosses r remain covered until after the Veneration
      of the Cross by the Celebrant on Good Friday; but the other sacred
      images remain covered until the intonation of the Angelic Hymn
      on Holy Saturday..<BR>
<BR>
      (From this day until after Good Friday the Psalm, </I>Give sentence
      with me, <I>it is not said before the </I>Confiteor ; <I>nor
      yet </I>Glory be to the Father <I>at the Psalm </I>I will wash
      my hands.)<BR>
