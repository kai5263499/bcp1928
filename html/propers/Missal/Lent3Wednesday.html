      my hope hath been in thee, O Lord : I will be glad, and rejoice

      GRANT, we beseech thee, O Lord, that we being taught by abstinence

      the pardon of thy loving-kindness. Through.<BR>

      </I><B>LESSON. <I>Exod. </I>20:12-24a</B><BR>
      12 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long
      upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee. <BR>
      13 Thou shalt not kill. <BR>
      14 Thou shalt not commit adultery. <BR>
      15 Thou shalt not steal. <BR>
      16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. <BR>
      17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not
      covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant,
      nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.
<BR>
      18 And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings,
      and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when
      the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off. <BR>
      19 And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will
      hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die. <BR>
      20 And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come
      to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that
      ye sin not. <BR>
      21 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the
      thick darkness where God was. <BR>
      22 And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the
      children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you
      from heaven. <BR>
      23 Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye
      make unto you gods of gold. <BR>
      24 An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice
      thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep,
      and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>GRADUAL. Ps. 6.</B> Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak:
      O Lord, heal me. V. For my bones are vexed : my soul also is
      sore troubled.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>TRACT. <I>Ps</I>. 103. </B>O Lord, deal not with us after
      our sins; nor reward us according to wickednesses. V. Ps. 79.
      Lord, remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and
      that soon: for we are come to great misery. V. <I>(Here genuflect.)</I>
      Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name, O
      Lord: O deliver us and be merciful unto our sins, for thy Name's
      sake.<BR>

      <B>GOSPEL. <I>St. Matthew</I> 15:1-20<BR>
      <FONT SIZE="-1"><IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></FONT></B>1 Then
      came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem,
      saying, <BR>
      2 Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders?
      for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. <BR>
      3 But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress
      the commandment of God by your tradition? <BR>
      4 For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and,
      He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death. <BR>
      5 But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother,
      It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;
<BR>
      6 And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free.
      Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your
      tradition. <BR>
      7 Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, <BR>
      8 This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth
      me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. <BR>
      9 But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the
      commandments of men. <BR>
      10 And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and
      understand: <BR>
      11 Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that
      which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man. <BR>
      12 Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that
      the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying? <BR>
      13 But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father
      hath not planted, shall be rooted up. <BR>
      14 Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if
      the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch. <BR>
      15 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this
      parable. <BR>
      16 And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding? <BR>
      17 Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the
      mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?
<BR>
      18 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth
      from the heart; and they defile the man. <BR>
      19 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,
      fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: <BR>
      20 These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen
      hands defileth not a man. <BR>
<BR>
      <B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps</I>. 109.</B> But deal thou with me, O Lord
      god, according unto thy Name: for sweet is thy mercy.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>SECRET</B>.<BR>
      Accept, O Lord, we beseech thee, the prayers of thy people, and
      the oblation of their sacrifice: that we which celebrate thy
      holy mysteries, may by thee be defended against all dangers that
      may beset us. Through.<BR>
      <B><BR>
      COMMUNION. <I>Ps</I>. 16. </B>Thou shalt shew me the path of
      life: in thy presence, O Lord, is the fulness of joy.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION</B>.<BR>
      Sanctify, O Lord, we pray thee, us thy servants, who have on
      this day been made partakers of thy holy table: that we, being
      cleansed from all our perversities, may be made worthy to obtain
      thy heavenly promises. Through.<BR>
<BR>
      <I>Over the people. </I>Let us pray. Bow down before the Lord.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR>
      Grant, we beseech thee, Almighty God: that we, who seek the grace
      of thy protection, may by thee be delivered from all evils, and
      serve thee with a quiet mind. Through.</P>
