      INTROIT. <I>Esto mihi. </I>Ps. 31<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>BE thou my strong rock,
      and house of defence, that thou mayest save me: for thou art
      my strong rock, and my castle: be thou also my guide, and lead
      me for thy Name's sake. <I>Ps. ibid. </I>In thee, O Lord, have
      I put my trust, let me never be put to confusion: but rid me
      and deliver me in thy righteousness V. Glory be. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      O LORD, who hast taught us that all our doings without charity
      are nothing worth; Send thy Holy Ghost, and pour into our hearts
      that most excellent gift of charity, the very bond of peace and
      of all virtues, without which whosoever liveth is counted dead
      before thee. Grant this for thine only Son Jesus Christ's sake.
      AMEN. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>EPISTLE. 1 <I>Corinthians </I>13<BR />
      </B>1 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and
      have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling
      cymbal. <BR />
      2 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all
      mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so
      that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.
<BR />
      3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though
      I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth
      me nothing. <BR />
      4 Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity
      vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, <BR />
      5 Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not
      easily provoked, thinketh no evil; <BR />
      6 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; <BR />
      7 Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things,
      endureth all things. <BR />
      8 Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they
      shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether
      there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. <BR />
      9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. <BR />
      10 But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is
      in part shall be done away. <BR />
      11 When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a
      child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away
      childish things. <BR />
      12 For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face:
      now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.
<BR />
      13 And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the
      greatest of these is charity. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>GRADUAL. <I>Psalm </I>77. </B>Thou art the God, that doeth
      wonders: and hast declared thy power among the people. V. Thou
      hast mightily delivered thy people: even the sons of Jacob and
      Joseph. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>TRACT. <I>Psalm </I>100.</B> O be joyful in the Lord, all
      ye lands: serve the Lord with gladness. V. Come before his presence
      with a song: be ye sure that the Lord, he is God. V. It is he
      that had made us and not we ourselves: we are his people and
      the sheep of his pasture.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>Saint Luke </I>18:31-43.<BR />
      <IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" /></B>31 Then he took unto him
      the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem,
      and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the
      Son of man shall be accomplished. <BR />
      32 For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be
      mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on: <BR />
      33 And they shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the
      third day he shall rise again. <BR />
      34 And they understood none of these things: and this saying
      was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.
<BR />
      35 And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho,
      a certain blind man sat by the way side begging: <BR />
      36 And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.
<BR />
      37 And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by. <BR />
      38 And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy
      on me. <BR />
      39 And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold
      his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou son of David,
      have mercy on me. <BR />
      40 And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him:
      and when he was come near, he asked him, <BR />
      41 Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said,
      Lord, that I may receive my sight. <BR />
      42 And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath
      saved thee. <BR />
      43 And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying
      God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God.
<BR />
<BR />
<BR />
      <B>OFFERTORY.</B> <B><I>Psalm </I>119.<I> </I></B>Blessed art
      thou, O Lord, O teach me thy statutes: with my lips have I been
      telling of all the judgements of thy mouth.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>SECRET.<BR />
      </B>GRANT, O Lord, we pray thee that this oblation may in such
      wise cleanse us from all our sins: that we, thy servants, being
      sanctified both in body and soul, may worthily offer unto thee
      this our sacrifice. [Through.] <BR />
<BR />
      <B>COMMUNION. <I>Psalm </I>78.<I> </I></B>They did eat and were
      well filled, for the Lord gave them their own desire: they were
      not disappointed of their lust. <BR />
<BR />
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR />
      WE beseech thee, Almighty God:that we who have received this
      heavenly food, may thereby be defended against all adversities.
      [Through.] <BR />
