      <B>INTROIT. <I>Benedicite. Ps. </I>103.<BR />
      </B>O PRAISE the Lord, ye Angels of his, ye that excel in strength:
      ye that fulfil his commandment,, and hearken unto the voice of
      his words. <I>Ps. ibid. </I>Praise the Lord, O my soul; and all
      that is within me praise his holy Name. V. Glory be.</P>

      <P><B>COLLECT.</B><BR />
      O GOD, who gavest blessed Raphael the Archangel unto thy servant
      Tobias to be the companion of his wayfaring: grant unto us thy
      servants; that we may ever be protected by the guardianship of
      this same thine Archangel, and defended by his help. Through.</P>

      <P><BR />
      <B>For</B> <B>The Epistle. <I>Tobit</I> 12:6-15</B><BR />
      6 IN THOSE days: the Angel Raphael said to Tobias: It is good
      to praise God, and exalt his name, and honourably to shew forth
      the works of God; therefore be not slack to praise him.<BR />
      7 It is good to keep close the secret of a king, but it is honourable
      to reveal the works of God. Do that which is good, and no evil
      shall touch you.<BR />
      8 Prayer is good with fasting and alms and righteousness. A little
      with righteousness is better than much with unrighteousness.
      It is better to give alms than to lay up gold:<BR />
      9 For alms doth deliver from death, and shall purge away all
      sin. Those that exercise alms and righteousness shall be filled
      with life:<BR />
      10 But they that sin are enemies to their own life.<BR />
      11 Surely I will keep close nothing from you. For I said, It
      was good to keep close the secret of a king, but that it was
      honourable to reveal the works of God.<BR />
      12 Now therefore, when thou didst pray, and Sara thy daughter
      in law, I did bring the remembrance of your prayers before the
      Holy One: and when thou didst bury the dead, I was with thee
      likewise.<BR />
      13 And when thou didst not delay to rise up, and leave thy dinner,
      to go and cover the dead, thy good deed was not hid from me:
      but I was with thee.<BR />
      14 And now God hath sent me to heal thee and Sara thy daughter
      in law.<BR />
      15 I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels, which present
      the prayers of the saints, and which go in and out before the
      glory of the Holy One.</P>

      <P><B>GRADUAL. <I>Tobit. 8. Vulgate. </I></B>Then the Angel Raphael
      took the devil, and bound him in the desert of upper Egypt. V.
      <I>Ps. </I>147. Great is our Lord and great is his power.<BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <I>Ps. </I>138. Even before the gods will
      I sing praise unto thee: I will worship toward thy holy temple
      and praise thy Name, O Lord. Alleluia.</P>

      <P><B>GOSPEL. <I>St John</I> 5:1-4<BR />
      </B><FONT COLOR="#000000">1 AT that time: There was a feast of
      the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.<BR />
      2 Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which
      is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.<BR />
      3 In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind,
      halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.<BR />
      4 For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and
      troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling
      of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease
      he had. <I>The Creed is said.</I></FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">OFFERTORY. <I>Rev. </I>8.</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"> An Angel stood at the altar of the temple,
      having a golden censer in his hand: and there was given unto
      him much incense: and the smoke of the incense ascended up before
      God.</FONT></P>

      WE humbly beseech thee, O Lord, that the prayers of thy holy
      Angels may assist us thy servants who offer unto thee this sacrifice
      of praise: that this our offering may be acceptable in thy sight,
      and profitable unto us for our salvation. Through.</FONT></P>
