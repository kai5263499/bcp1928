      am the salvation of my people, saith the Lord: in whatsoever
      tribulation they shall call upon me, I will hear them : and I
      will be their Lord for ever. Ps. 78. Hear my law, O my people:
      incline your ears unto the words of my mouth. V. Glory be.<BR>

      O God, who in this solemn festival hast bestowed upon thy blessed
      Saints Cosmas and Damian everlasting glory, and upon us the assistance
      of thine unspeakable providence : grant, we pray thee, that we,
      who now observe the same, may use it to the increasing of thy
      honour and glory. Through.<BR>

      </I><B>LESSON. <I>Jeremiah </I>7:1-7</B><BR>
      1 IN those days: The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD,
      saying, <BR>
      2 Stand in the gate of the LORD'S house, and proclaim there this
      word, and say, Hear the word of the LORD, all ye of Judah, that
      enter in at these gates to worship the LORD. <BR>
      3 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your
      ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.
<BR>
      4 Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the LORD,
      The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, are these. <BR>
      5 For if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye
      thoroughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour;
<BR>
      6 If ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow,
      and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after
      other gods to your hurt: <BR>
      7 Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that
      I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever. <BR>
<BR>
      <B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps</I>. 145. </B>The eyes of all wait upon thee,
      O Lord: and thou givest them their meat in due season. V. Thou
      openest thine hand, and fillest all things living with plenteousness.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>St. Luke </I>4:38-44<BR>
      <FONT SIZE="-1"><IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></FONT></B>38
      AT that time: Jesus arose out of the synagogue, and entered into
      Simon's house. And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great
      fever; and they besought him for her. <BR>
      39 And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left
      her: and immediately she arose and ministered unto them. <BR>
      40 Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with
      divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands
      on every one of them, and healed them. <BR>
      41 And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying,
      Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered
      them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ. <BR>
      42 And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place:
      and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him,
      that he should not depart from them. <BR>
      43 And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to
      other cities also: for therefore am I sent. <BR>
      44 And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee. <BR>
<BR>
      <B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps</I>. 138. </B>Though I walk in the midst
      of trouble, yet shalt thou refresh me, O Lord : thou shalt stretch
      forth thy hand upon the furiousness of mine enemies, and thy
      right hand shall save me.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>SECRET</B>.<BR>
      O Lord, who in this holy sacrifice hast given unto us thyself
      the firstfruits of all martyrs: we beseech thee to accept the
      oblations which we render unto thee, in honour of thy servants,
      whose death is right dear in thy sight. Who livest and reignest
      with the Father.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>COMMUNION. <I>Ps</I>. 119. </B>Thou hast charged that we shall
      diligently keep thy commandments: O that my ways were made so
      direct that I might keep thy statutes.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR>
      Grant, we pray thee, O Lord, that we who have here received this
      holy Sacrament pleading the merits of thy blessed Martyrs Cosmas
      and Damian: may obtain therein the assurance of our everlasting
      salvation. Through.<BR>
<BR>
      Over the people. Let us pray. Bow down before the Lord.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR>
      Grant, O Lord, we pray thee, that the abundance of thy heavenly
      favour may strengthen and increase thy people: and make them
      ever to walk obediently after thy commandments. Through.</P>
