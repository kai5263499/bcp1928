      <B>LESSON<I>. </I>I<I> Kings </I>3:16-28.</B><BR>
      16 Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto king Solomon,
      and stood before him. <BR>
      17 And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell
      in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the
      house. <BR>
      18 And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered,
      that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there
      was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.
<BR>
      19 And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid
      it. <BR>
      20 And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me,
      while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid
      her dead child in my bosom. <BR>
      21 And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold,
      it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold,
      it was not my son, which I did bear. <BR>
      22 And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and
      the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son,
      and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the king. <BR>
      23 Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth,
      and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son
      is the dead, and my son is the living. <BR>
      24 And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword
      before the king. <BR>
      25 And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give
      half to the one, and half to the other. <BR>
      26 Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king,
      for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord,
      give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other
      said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it. <BR>
      27 Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child,
      and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof. <BR>
      28 And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged;
      and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God
      was in him, to do judgment. <BR>
<BR>
      <B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps</I>. 31. </B>Be thou my strong rock, and house
      of defence, that thou mayest save me. V. Ps. 71. In thee, O Lord,
      have I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>TRACT. <I>Ps</I>. 103. </B>O Lord, deal not with us after
      our sins; nor reward us according to wickednesses. V. Ps. 79.
      Lord, remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and
      that soon: for we are come to great misery. V. <I>(Here genuflect.)</I>
      Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name, O
      Lord: O deliver us and be merciful unto our sins, for thy Name's
      sake.<BR>

      AT that time: the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went
      up to Jerusalem, <BR>
      14 And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and
      doves, and the changers of money sitting: <BR>
      15 And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them
      all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured
      out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables; <BR>
      16 And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence;
      make not my Father's house an house of merchandise. <BR>
      17 And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal
      of thine house hath eaten me up. <BR>
      18 Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign showest
      thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things? <BR>
      19 Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and
      in three days I will raise it up. <BR>
      20 Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in
      building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days? <BR>
      21 But he spake of the temple of his body. <BR>
      22 When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered
      that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture,
      and the word which Jesus had said. <BR>
      23 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast
      day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which
      he did. <BR>
      24 But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew
      all men, <BR>
      25 And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew
      what was in man. <BR>
      <B><BR>
      OFFERTORY. <I>Ps</I>. 100. </B>O be joyful in the Lord, all ye
      lands, serve the Lord with gladness: and come before his presence
      with a song: be ye sure that the Lord he is God.<BR>

      thee, may evermore avail to quicken and defend us. through.<BR>
