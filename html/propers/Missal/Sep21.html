      <P><B>INTROIT. <I>Os Justi. Ps. </I>37<BR />
      </B>THE mouth of the righteous is exercised in wisdom: and his
      tongue will be talking of judgement: the law of God is in his
      heart. <I>Ps. ibid. </I>Fret not thyself because of the ungodly:
      neither be thou envious against evil doers. V. Glory be.</P>

      <P><B>COLLECT.<BR />
      </B>O ALMIGHTY God, who by thy blessed Son didst call Matthew
      from the receipt of custom to be an Apostle and Evangelist; Grant
      us grace to forsake all covetous desires, and inordinate love
      of riches, and to follow the same thy Son Jesus Christ, who liveth
      and reigneth with thee and the Holy Ghost, one God, world without
      end. Amen.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><B>EPISTLE<I>. 2 Corinthians iv. 1.</I></B><BR />
      THEREFORE seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy,
      we faint not; but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty,
      not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully;
      but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every
      man's conscience in the sight of God. But if our gospel be hid,
      it is hid to them that are lost: in whom the god of this world
      hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light
      of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should
      shine unto them. For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus
      the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake. For God,
      who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined
      in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory
      of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</P>

      <P><B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps. </I>112.<BR />
      </B>Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord: he hath great delight
      in his commandments. V. His seed shall be mighty upon earth:
      the generation of the faithful shall be blessed.<BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. The glorious company of the Apostles praise
      thee, O Lord. Alleluia.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><B>GOSPEL. <I>St. Matthew </I>9:9</B><BR />
      AND as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew,
      sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow
      me. And he arose, and followed him. And it came to pass, as Jesus
      sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners
      came and sat down with him and his disciples. And when the Pharisees
      saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master
      with publicans and sinners? But when Jesus heard that, he said
      unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they
      that are sick. But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will
      have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the
      righteous, but sinners to repentance.</P>

      <P><B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps. </I>21. </B>Thou hast set, O Lord, a
      crown of pure gold upon his head: he asked life of thee, and
      thou gavest him a long life, alleluia.</P>

      <P><B>SECRET</B>.<BR />
      O GOD, who dost instruct thy Church with the wondrous preaching
      of thy blessed Apostle and Evangelist Saint Matthew: grant, we
      beseech thee, that by his intercession the oblations of thy people
      may ever be rendered acceptable in thy sight. Through.</P>

      <P>PREFACE <I>of the Apostles.</I></P>

      <P><B>COMMUNION. <I>Ibid. </I></B>His honour is great in thy
      salvation: glory and great worship shalt thou lay upon him, O
      Lord.</P>

      <P><B>POSTCOMMUNION</B>.<BR />
      O LORD, who hast vouchsafed to make us partakers of this holy
      Sacrament: grant, we beseech thee, that at the intercession of
      thy blessed Apostle and Evangelist Saint Matthew, the sacrifice
      we have offered to the increase of his glory may be profitable
      unto us for the healing of our souls. Through.</P>
