      THE righteous shall rejoice in thy strength, O Lord: exceeding
      glad shall he be in thy salvation: thou hast given him his heart's
      desire. <I>Ps. ibid. </I>For thou has prevented him with the
      blessings of goodness: and hast set a crown of pure gold upon
      his head. V. Glory be.</P>

      O LORD, who hast sanctified this day to thy blessed Saint Alban
      by his glorious martyrdom: grant, we beseech thee; that as year
      by year we do rejoice to pay him honour, so we may ever be defended
      by his continual help. Through.</P>

      <B>For the Epistle. <FONT COLOR="#000000">Wisdom 10:10-14<BR />

      10 The Lord guided the righteous in right paths, shewed him the
      kingdom of God, and gave him knowledge of holy things: made him
      rich in his travels, and multiplied the fruit of his labours.<BR />
      11 In the covetousness of such as oppressed him he stood by him,
      and made him rich.<BR />
      12 He defended him from his enemies, and kept him safe from those
      that lay in wait, and in a sore conflict he gave him the victory;
      that he might know that godliness is stronger than all.<BR />
      13 When the righteous was sold, wisdom forsook him not, but delivered
      him from sin: she went down with him into the pit,<BR />
      14 and left him not in bonds, till she brought him the sceptre
      of the kingdom, and power against those that oppressed him: as
      for those that had accused him, she shewed them to be liars,
      and gave him perpetual glory, O Lord our God.</FONT></P>

      </B><FONT SIZE="-1">[From Mass 4, In virtute tua]</FONT><BR />
      34 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not
      to send peace, but a sword.<BR />
      35 For I am come to set a man at variance against his father,
      and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law
      against her mother-in-law.<BR />
      36 And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.<BR />
      37 He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy
      of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not
      worthy of me.<BR />
      38 And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me,
      is not worthy of me.<BR />
      39 He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth
      his life for my sake shall find it.<BR />
      40 He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth
      me receiveth him that sent me.<BR />
      41 He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall
      receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous
      man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous
      man's reward.<BR />
      42 And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little
      ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily
      I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.</P>

      <P><B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps. </I>8. </B>Thou hast crowned him with

      </B>O Lord, who didst vouchsafe to offer thyself unto thy Father
      to be a living sacrifice for thy people: mercifully grant that
      this our present oblation may be acceptable in thy sight for
      the salvation of the same. Who livest and reignest withy the

      <P><B>COMMUNION. <I>St, Matt. </I>17 </B>If any man will come
      after me, let him deny himself, and take up his Cross and follow
      me.</P>

      </B>GRANT, O Lord, we pray thee, that blessed Alban thy Martyr
      may evermore implore for us the favour of thy divine majesty:
      that this holy Sacrament which we have received; may effectually
      avail to cleanse us from all our iniquities, and to preserve
      in us thy most excellent gift of charity. Through.</P>
