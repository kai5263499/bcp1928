      </I><B>LESSON. <I>2 Kings </I>4:1-7</B><BR>
      1 IN those days: a certain woman of the wives of the sons of
      the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead;
      and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD: and the
      creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen.
<BR>
      2 And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me,
      what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath
      not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil. <BR>
      3 Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours,
      even empty vessels; borrow not a few. <BR>
      4 And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee
      and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels,
      and thou shalt set aside that which is full. <BR>
      5 So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her
      sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out. <BR>
      6 And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said
      unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There
      is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed. <BR>
      7 Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell
      the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of
      the rest. <BR>
<BR>
      <B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps</I>. 19.</B> who can tell how oft he offendeth:
      O cleanse thou me from my secret faults. V. Keep thy servant
      also from presumptuous sins, lest they get the dominion over
      me: so shall I be undefiled, and innocent from the great offence.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>GOSPEL. <I>St. Matthew </I>18:15-22<BR>
      <FONT SIZE="-1"><IMG SRC="../../../Pictures/cross1.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></FONT></B>15
      AT that time: Jesus said unto his disciples: if thy brother shall
      trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee
      and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.
<BR>
      16 But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two
      more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word
      may be established. <BR>
      17 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church:
      but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as
      an heathen man and a publican. <BR>
      18 Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall
      be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall
      be loosed in heaven. <BR>
      19 Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth
      as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for
      them of my Father which is in heaven. <BR>
      20 For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there
      am I in the midst of them. <BR>
      21 Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother
      sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? <BR>
      22 Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times:
      but, Until seventy times seven. <BR>
<BR>
      <B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps</I>. 118. </B>The right hand of the Lord
      hath the pre-eminence, the right hand of the Lord bringeth mighty
      things to pass: I shall not die but live, and declare the works
      of the Lord. <BR>
<BR>
      <B>SECRET.</B><BR>
      We beseech thee,O Lord, that this Sacrament may effectually accomplish
      in us the work of our redemption : that we, being delivered from
      the lusts of the flesh, may attain to thy gift of everlasting
      salvation. Through.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>COMMUNION. <I>Ps</I>. 15.</B> Lord, who shall dwell in thy
      tabernacle? Or who shall rest upon thy holy hill? Even he that
      leadeth an uncorrupt life, and doeth the thing that is right.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR>
      O Lord, who hast vouchsafed to purge us by these holy mysteries:
      grant, we beseech thee, that we may obtain of thy mercy pardon
      and grace. Through.<BR>
<BR>
      <I>Over the people. </I>Let us pray. Bow down before the lord.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>COLLECT.</B><BR>
      We pray thee, O Lord, defend us with thy mighty succour: and
      preserve us evermore against all the assaults of iniquity. Through.</P>
