    <p><b><br />
      INTROIT</b>.<i> Inclina, Domine. Ps.</i> 86<br />
      BOW down thine ear, O Lord,
      and hear me: my God, save thy servant, that putteth his trust
      in thee: be merciful unto me, O Lord, for I will call daily upon
      thee. <i>Ibid Ps. </i>Comfort the soul of thy servant: for unto
      thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. V. Glory be.<br />
        <br />
    </p>
    <p><b>COLLECT.</b><br />
      KEEP, we beseech thee, O Lord, thy Church with thy perpetual
      mercy; and, because the frailty of man without thee cannot but
      fall, keep us ever by thy help from all things hurtful, and lead
      us to all things profitable to our salvation; through Jesus Christ
      our Lord. AMEN.<br />
    </p>
    <p><b>EPISTLE.</b> <i>Galatians 6:11-18</i><br />
      11 Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine
      own hand.<br />
      12 As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they constrain
      you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution
      for the cross of Christ.<br />
      13 For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law;
      but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your
      flesh.<br />
      14 But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our
      Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and
      I unto the world.<br />
      15 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing,
      nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.<br />
      16 And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them,
      and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.<br />
      17 From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body
      the marks of the Lord Jesus.<br />
      18 Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your
      spirit. Amen.<br />
        <br />
        <b>GRADUAL.</b> <i>Ps. 92 </i>It is a good thing to give thanks
      unto the Lord: and to sing praises unto thy Name, O Most Highest. <i>V.</i> To tell of thy lovingkindness early in the morning,
      and of thy truth in the night-season.<br />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <i>Ps. 95 </i>For the Lord is a great
      God, and a great King above all gods. Alleluia.<br />
    </p>
    <p><b>GOSPEL. </b><i>St. Matthew 6:24-34</i><br />
      24 No man can serve two masters:
      for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else
      he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve
      God and mammon.<br />
      25 Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what
      ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body,
      what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the
      body than raiment?<br />
      26 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do
      they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth
      them. Are ye not much better than they?<br />
      27 Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his
      stature?<br />
      28 And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of
      the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:<br />
      29 And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory
      was not arrayed like one of these.<br />
      30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which
      to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not
      much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?<br />
      31 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or,
      What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?<br />
      32 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your
      heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.<br />
      33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness;
      and all these things shall be added unto you.<br />
      34 Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall
      take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day
      is the evil thereof.<br />
        <br />
        <b>OFFERTORY.</b><i> </i>Ps. 40:1, 3 I waited patiently for the
      Lord, and he inclined unto me: he heard my calling, and he hath
      put a new song in my mouth, even a thanksgiving unto our God.</p>
    <p><b>SECRET<br />
      </b>GRANT, we beseech thee, O Lord our God: that this saving
      Victim may effectually avail, both for the cleansing of our souls
      from all their sins, and for the obtaining of the favour of thine
      almighty power. Through.<br />
    </p>
    <p><b>COMMUNION. </b><i>St. John 6:51 </i>The bread that I will
      give is my Flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.<br />
        <br />
        <b>POSTCOMMUNION.<br />
        </b>GRANT, O Lord, we pray thee: that this holy Sacrament may
      in such wise cleanse and defend us; that we may thereby attain
      to the fulfilment of everlasting salvation. [Through.]<br />
