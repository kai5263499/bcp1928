      </B>RIGHT dear are thy friends unto me, O God, and held in highest
      honour: their rule and governance is exceeding stedfast. <I>Ps.
      ibid. </I>Lord, thou hast searched me out and known me: thou
      knowest my downsitting and my uprising. V. Glory be.</P>

      <P><B>COLLECT.<BR />
      </B>O ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, who didst give to thine Apostle
      Bartholomew grace truly to believe and to preach thy Word: grant,
      we beseech thee, unto thy Church, to love that Word which he
      believed, and both to preach and receive the same. Through.</P>

      <B>For the Epistle.</B> <B><I>Acts v. 12.</I></B><BR />
      IN those days: By the hands of the apostles were many signs and
      wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one
      accord in Solomon's porch. And of the rest dust no man join himself
      to them: but the people magnified them. And believers were the
      more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.) Insomuch
      that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them
      on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing
      by might overshadow some of them. There came also a multitude
      out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks,
      and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were
      healed every one.</P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">GRADUAL. &nbsp;<I>Ps. </I>45. </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Thou shalt make them princes in all lands: they
      shall remember thy Name, O Lord. V. Instead of thy fathers thou
      shalt have children: therefore shall the people give thanks unto
      thee.<BR />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. The glorious company of the Apostles praise
      thee, O Lord. Alleluia.</FONT></P>

      <P><B>GOSPEL. <I>St. Luke xxii. </I>24.</B></P>

      <P>AND there was also a strife among them, which of them should
      be accounted the greatest. And he said unto them, The kings of
      the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise
      authority upon them are called benefactors. But ye shall not
      be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger;
      and he that is chief, as he that doth serve. For whether is greater,
      he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth
      at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth. Ye are they which
      have continued with me in my temptations. And I appoint unto
      you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me; that ye may
      eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging
      the twelve tribes of Israel.</P>
