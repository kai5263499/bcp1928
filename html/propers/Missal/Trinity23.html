          THE 23RD SUNDAY AFTER TRINITY<br />
        </font></b>

    </p>
    <p><br />
      <b>INTROIT. <i>Dicit Dominus. Jer. </i>29.<br />
      </b>THUS saith the Lord:
      I know the thoughts that I think toward you, thoughts of peace,
      and not of evil: ye shall call upon me, and I will hearken unto
      you: and will turn away your captivity from all the nations. <i>Ps. </i>85. Lord, thou art become gracious unto thy land:
      thou hast turned away the captivity of Jacob. V. Glory be.</p>
    <p><b>COLLECT.<br />
      </b>O GOD, our refuge and strength, who art the author of all
      godliness: be ready, we beseech thee, to hear the devout prayers
      of thy Church; and grant that those things which we ask faithfully
      we may obtain effectually. Through Jesus Christ our Lord. [Who.]</p>
    <p><b>EPISTLE. <i>Philippians </i>3:17-21</b><br />
      17 Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which
      walk so as ye have us for an ensample. <br />
      18 (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell
      you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ: <br />
      19 Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose
      glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.) <br />
      20 For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look
      for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: <br />
      21 Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like
      unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is
      able even to subdue all things unto himself.</p>
    <p><b>GRADUAL. <i>Ps. </i>44. </b>It is thou, O Lord, that savest
      us from our enemies: and puttest them to confusion that hate
      us. V. We make our boast of God all day long, and will praise
      thy Name for ever.<br />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <i>Ps. </i>130. Out of the deep have I
      called unto thee, O Lord: Lord hear my voice. Alleluia.</p>
    <p><b>GOSPEL. <i>St. Matthew 22:15-22<br />
      </i></b>15 Then went the Pharisees,
      and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk. <br />
      16 And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians,
      saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the
      way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou
      regardest not the person of men. <br />
      17 Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give
      tribute unto Caesar, or not? <br />
      18 But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt
      ye me, ye hypocrites? <br />
      19 Show me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny. <br />
      20 And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? <br />
      21 They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render
      therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto
      God the things that are God's. <br />
      22 When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left
      him, and went their way.</p>
    <p><b>OFFERTORY. <i>Ps. </i>130. </b>Out of the deep have I called
      unto thee, O Lord: Lord, hear my voice: out of the deep have
      I called unto thee, O Lord.</p>
    <p><b>SECRET.<br />
      </b>GRANT, we beseech thee, merciful Lord: that by this sacrifice
      ordained for our salvation, we may evermore be delivered from
      the bonds of our sins, and defended against all adversities.
      Through.</p>
    <p><b>COMMUNION. <i>St. Mark </i>11.</b> Therefore I say unto
      you, what things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that
      ye receive them, and ye shall have them.</p>
    <p><b>POSTCOMMUNION.</b><br />
      O LORD, who hast made us partakers of the gifts of these holy
      mysteries: we humbly beseech thee, that those things, which thou
      hast commanded us to do in remembrance of thee, may be profitable
      to the succour of all our infirmities. Who livest and reignest
      with the Father.</p>
