      <P><B>The Epistle.2 Timothy 4:1-8</B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      1 DEARLY BELOVED: I charge thee therefore before God, and the
      Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at
      his appearing and his kingdom;<BR />
      2 Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove,
      rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.<BR />
      3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine;
      but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers,
      having itching ears;<BR />
      4 And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall
      be turned unto fables.<BR />
      5 But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work
      of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.<BR />
      6 For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure
      is at hand.<BR />
      7 I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have
      kept the faith:<BR />
      8 Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,
      which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day:
      and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.</FONT></P>

      <P><B>The Gospel. St. Luke 12:35-40</B><BR />
      35 AT THAT TIME: Jesus said unto his disciples: Let your loins
      be girded about, and your lights burning;<BR />
      36 And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord,
      when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and
      knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.<BR />
      37 Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall
      find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself,
      and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve
      them.<BR />
      38 And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third
      watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.<BR />
      39 And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known
      what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not
      have suffered his house to be broken through.<BR />
      40 Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an
      hour when ye think not.</P>

      <P><B>OFFERTORY. <I>Ps. 89. </I></B>I have found David my servant,
      with my holy oil have I anointed him: may hand shall hold him
      fast and my arm shall strengthen him.</P>

      GRANT, we beseech thee, O Lord, that we, remembering with gladness
      the righteousness of thy Saints, may at all times and in all
      places feel the effectual succour of their intercession. Through.</P>
