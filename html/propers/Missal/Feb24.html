      <B>Epistle. <I><FONT COLOR="#000000">Acts </FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#000000">1:15-26</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR />
      15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples,
      and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred
      and twenty,) <BR />
      16 Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled,
      which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning
      Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus. <BR />
      17 For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this
      ministry. <BR />
      18 Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity;
      and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all
      his bowels gushed out. <BR />
      19 And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch
      as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that
      is to say, The field of blood. <BR />
      20 For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation
      be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishopric
      let another take. <BR />
      21 Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the
      time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, <BR />
      22 Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that
      he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness
      with us of his resurrection. <BR />
      23 And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed
      Justus, and Matthias. <BR />
      24 And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts
      of all men, show whether of these two thou hast chosen, <BR />
      25 That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from
      which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own
      place. <BR />
      26 And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias;
      and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</FONT></P>

      in ighest honour: their rule and governance is exceeding stedfast.
      V. If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand
      of the sea.</FONT></P>

      </B><FONT COLOR="#000000">25 At that time Jesus answered and
      said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because
      thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast
      revealed them unto babes. <BR />
      26 Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight. <BR />
      27 All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man
      knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the
      Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal
      him. <BR />
      28 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and
      I will give you rest. <BR />
      29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and
      lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. <BR />
      30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. <I>The Creed
      is said.</I></FONT></P>
