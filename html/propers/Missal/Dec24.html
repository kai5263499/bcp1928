      1 Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated
      unto the gospel of God,<BR />
      2 (Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)<BR />
      3 Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of
      the seed of David according to the flesh;<BR />
      4 And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to
      the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:<BR />
      5 By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience
      to the faith among all nations, for his name:<BR />
      6 Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ our Lord.</FONT></P>

      upon the Cherubims, before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasses.</FONT></P>

      <P><B>GOSPEL. St Matthew 1:18-21<BR />
      </B><FONT COLOR="#000000">18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was
      on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph,
      before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy
      Ghost.<BR />
      19 Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing
      to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily.<BR />
      20 But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of
      the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son
      of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that
      which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.<BR />
      21 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name
      JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.</FONT></P>

      GRANT, we beseech thee, Almighty God: that like as we do now

      with thee.</FONT></P>

      of his birth. Through the same.</FONT></P>
