          THE 14TH SUNDAY AFTER TRINITY<br />
        </font></b>
      </center>
    </p>
    <p><b>INTROIT. <i>Protector noster. Ps. </i>84.<br />
      </b> BEHOLD, O God, our defender,
      and look upon the face of thine Anointed: for one day in thy
      courts is better than a thousand. <i>Ps. ibid.</i> O how amiable
      are thy dwellings, thou Lord of hosts; my soul hath a desire,
      and longing to enter into the courts of the Lord. V. Glory be.</p>
    <p><b>COLLECT.</b><br />
      ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, give unto us the increase of faith,
      hope, and charity; and, that we may obtain that which thou dost
      promise, make us to love that which thou dost command; through
      Jesus Christ our Lord. [Who.]</p>
    <p><b>EPISTLE.<i> Galatians 5: 16-24</i></b><br />
      16 BRETHREN: I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not
      fulfil the lust of the flesh.<br />
      17 For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against
      the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that
      ye cannot do the things that ye would.<br />
      18 But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.<br />
      19 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these;
      Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,10<br />
      20 Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath,
      strife, seditions, heresies,<br />
      21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like:
      of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time
      past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom
      of God.<br />
      22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
      gentleness, goodness, faith,<br />
      23 Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.<br />
      24 And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the
      affections and lusts.</p>
    <p><b>GRADUAL. <i>Ps. </i>118. </b>It is better to trust in the
      Lord, than to put any confidence in man. V. It is better to trust
      in the Lord, than to put any confidence in princes.<br />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <i>Ps. </i>95 O come, let us sing unto
      the Lord: let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our salvation.
      Alleluia.</p>
    <p><b>GOSPEL</b><i>. </i><b>St. Luke 17:11-19</b><br />
      11 AT that time: And it came
      to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the
      midst of Samaria and Galilee.<br />
      12 And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten
      men that were lepers, which stood afar off:<br />
      13 And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master,
      have mercy on us.<br />
      14 And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go show yourselves
      unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they
      were cleansed.<br />
      15 And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back,
      and with a loud voice glorified God,<br />
      16 And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks:
      and he was a Samaritan.<br />
      17 And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but
      where are the nine?<br />
      18 There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save
      this stranger.<br />
      19 And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made
      thee whole.</p>
    <p><b>OFFERTORY<i> Ps. </i>34 </b>The Angel of the Lord tarrieth
      round about them that fear him, and delivereth them: O taste,
      and see, how gracious is the Lord.</p>
    <p><b>SECRET.</b><br />
      WE pray thee, O Lord, to look down in mercy on thy people, and
      on the oblations which they offer unto thee: that being thereby
      rendered acceptable in thy sight, we may obtain of thee the remission
      of all our sins, and the effectual fulfilment of all our desires.
      Through.</p>
