          THE 12TH SUNDAY AFTER TRINITY<br />
        </font></b>
      </center>
    </p>
    <p><b>INTROIT. <i>Deus in adjutorium. Ps. 79.<br />
      </i></b> HASTE thee, O God, to deliver
      me: make hast to help me, O Lord: let them be ashamed and confounded,
      that seek after my soul. <i>Ps. ibid. </i>Let them be turned
      backward, and put to confusion: that wish me evil. V. Glory be.</p>
    <p><b>COLLECT.</b><br />
      ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, who art always more ready to hear
      than we are to pray, and art wont to give more than either we
      desire or deserve: pour down upon us the abundance of thy mercy;
      forgiving us those things whereof our conscience is afraid, and
      giving us those good things which we are not worthy to ask, but
      through the merits and mediation of Jesus Christ, thy Son, our
      Lord. AMEN.</p>
    <p><b>EPISTLE.<i> 2 Corinthians 3:4-9<br />
      </i></b>4 BRETHREN: such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:<br />
      5 Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing
      as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;<br />
      6 Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament;
      not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth,
      but the spirit giveth life.<br />
      7 But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones,
      was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly
      behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which
      glory was to be done away:<br />
      8 How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?<br />
      9 For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more
      doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.</p>
    <p><b>GRADUAL. <i>Ps</i></b><i>. <b>34.</b></i> I will alway
      give thanks unto the Lord: his praise shall ever be in my mouth.
      V. My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the humble shall
      hear thereof and be glad.<br />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <i>Ps. </i>88. O Lord God of my salvation,
      I have cried day and night before thee. Alleluia.</p>
    <p><b>GOSPEL.<i> St. Mark 7:31-37<br />
      </i></b> 31 AT that time: Jesus, departing
      from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee,
      through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.<br />
      32 And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment
      in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.<br />
      33 And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers
      into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;<br />
      34 And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha,
      that is, Be opened.<br />
      35 And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his
      tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.<br />
      36 And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the
      more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published
      it;<br />
      37 And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all
      things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to
      speak.<br />
        <br />
        <b>OFFERTORY. <i>Ex</i></b><i>. <b>32.</b></i> Moses besought
      the Lord his God, and said: Lord, why doth thy wrath wax hot
      against thy people? Turn from thy fierce wrath: remember Abraham,
      Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest to give
      a land flowing with milk and honey. And the Lord repented of
      the evil which he thought to do unto his people.</p>
    <p><b>SECRET.<br />
      </b>REGARD, O Lord, we pray thee, this our bounden duty and service:
      that this sacrifice may be an oblation acceptable unto thee,
      and effectually avail for the succour of our frailty. [Through.]</p>
    <p><b>COMMUNION. <i>Ps</i></b><i>. <b>104.</b></i> The earth,
      O Lord, is filled with the fruit of thy works: that thou mayest
      bring food out of the earth, and wine that maketh glad the heart
      of man: and oil to make him a cheerful countenance, and bread
      to strengthen man's heart.</p>
    <p><b>POSTCOMMUNION.<br />
      </b>WE beseech thee, O Lord, that we which have received this
      holy sacrament: may in such wise feel the effectual succour of
      the same; that we being preserved both in body and soul may glory
      in the fulness of thy heavenly healing. [Through.]</p>
