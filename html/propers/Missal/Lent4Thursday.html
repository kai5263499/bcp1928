      </I><B>LESSON. <I>2 Kings </I>4:25-38a</B><BR>
      25 IN those days: The Shunammite woman came unto Elisha to mount
      Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar
      off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that
      Shunammite: <BR>
      26 Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it
      well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with
      the child? And she answered, It is well. <BR>
      27 And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught
      him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And
      the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within
      her: and the LORD hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.
<BR>
      28 Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say,
      Do not deceive me? <BR>
      29 Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff
      in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him
      not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my
      staff upon the face of the child. <BR>
      30 And the mother of the child said, As the LORD liveth, and
      as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and
      followed her. <BR>
      31 And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon
      the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing.
      Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The
      child is not awaked. <BR>
      32 And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child
      was dead, and laid upon his bed. <BR>
      33 He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and
      prayed unto the LORD. <BR>
      34 And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth
      upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon
      his hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh
      of the child waxed warm. <BR>
      35 Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and
      went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed
      seven times, and the child opened his eyes. <BR>
      36 And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he
      called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take
      up thy son. <BR>
      37 Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself
      to the ground, and took up her son, and went out. <BR>
      38 And Elisha came again to Gilgal.</P>

      <B>GRADUAL. <I>Ps</I>. 74. </B>Look upon the covenant, O Lord:
      and forget not the congregation of the poor for ever. V. Arise,
      O God, maintain thine own cause: remember how the foolish man
      blasphemeth thee daily.<BR>

      At that time: Jesus went into a city called Nain; and many of
      his disciples went with him, and much people. <BR>
      12 Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there
      was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she
      was a widow: and much people of the city was with her. <BR>
      13 And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said
      unto her, Weep not. <BR>
      14 And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood
      still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise. <BR>
      15 And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered
      him to his mother. <BR>
      16 And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying,
      That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath
      visited his people. ear on all ; and they glorified god, saying
      : That a great prophet is risen up among us ; and, That God hath
      visited his people.<BR>

      Cleanse us, O Lord, we beseech thee, of thine infinite mercy:
      that, like as the prayers and devout oblations of thy Church
      are ever acceptable in thy sight, so the same may be rendered
      yet more acceptable by reason of the purity of our souls. Through.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>COMMUNION. <I>Ps</I>.71. </B>O Lord, I will make mention of
      thy righteousness only: thou, O God hast taught me from my youth
      up until now: forsake me not, O God, in mine old age, when I
      am grey-headed.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>POSTCOMMUNION.</B><BR>
      O Lord, who hast here bestowed upon us the bounty of thy heavenly
      gifts : grant, we pray thee, that those things which thou hast
      ordained for the healing of thy faithful people, may not be turned
      unto their damnation. Through.<BR>
<BR>
      <I>Over the people. </I>Let us pray. Bow down before the Lord.<BR>
<BR>
      COLLECT,<BR>
      O God, the creator and governour of thy faithful people: we beseech
      thee, that thou wouldest drive far from us all the assaults of
      temptation; that we, being ever found acceptable in thy sight,
      may by thee be defended from the fear of our enemies. Through.
