    </p>
    <p><b><i><br />
      </i>INTROIT. <i>Exaudi, Domine. Ps. 27.<br />
      </i></b>HEARKEN unto my voice, O Lord,
      when I cry unto thee: thou hast been my succour, leave me not,
      neither forsake me, O God of my salvation. <i>Ps. ibid. </i>The
      Lord is my light, and my salvation: whom then shall I fear? V.
      Glory be.</p>
    <p><b>COLLECT</b>.<br />
      GRANT, O Lord, we beseech thee: that the course of this world
      may be so peaceably ordered by thy governance, that thy Church
      may joyfully serve thee in all godly quietness; through Jesus
      Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
    <p><b>EPISTLE. <i>I St. Peter </i>3:8-15</b><br />
      8 DEARLY beloved: be ye all of one mind, having compassion one
      of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:<br />
      9 Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise
      blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should
      inherit a blessing.<br />
      10 For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain
      his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:<br />
      11 Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and
      ensue it.<br />
      12 For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears
      are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against
      them that do evil.<br />
      13 And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that
      which is good?<br />
      14 But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye:
      and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;<br />
      15 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts:</p>
    <p><b>GRADUAL</b>.<i> Ps. </i>84. Behold, O God, our defender:
      and look upon thy servants. V. O Lord God of Hosts, hear the
      prayer of thy servants.<br />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <i>Ps.</i> 20. The king shall rejoice
      in thy strength, O Lord: exceeding glad shall he be of thy salvation.
      Alleluia.</p>
    <p><b>GOSPEL. <i>St. Luke </i>5:1-11</b><br />
      1 AT that time: it came to
      pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of
      God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,<br />
      2 And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were
      gone out of them, and were washing their nets.<br />
      3 And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and
      prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And
      he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.<br />
      4 Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out
      into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.<br />
      5 And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all
      the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I
      will let down the net.<br />
      6 And when they had this done, they enclosed a great multitude
      of fishes: and their net brake.<br />
      7 And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other
      ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and
      filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.<br />
      8 When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying,
      Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.<br />
      9 For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught
      of the fishes which they had taken:<br />
      10 And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which
      were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not;
      from henceforth thou shalt catch men.<br />
      11 And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook
      all, and followed him.</p>
    <p><b>OFFERTORY</b>. <i>Ps.</i> 16. I will thank the Lord for
      giving me warning: I have set God always before me: for he is
      on my right hand, therefore I shall not fall.</p>
    <p><b>SECRET</b>.<br />
      MOST merciful Lord, we beseech thee, to have respect unto these
      our oblations : that whereas we have rebelled and done evil against
      thee, we may by thy grace be conformed unto thy will. through.</p>
    <p><b>COMMUNION.<i> Ps. </i>27. </b>One thing have I desired
      of the Lord, which I will require :even that I may dwell in the
      house of the Lord all the days of my life.</p>
    <p><b>POSTCOMMUNION</b>.<br />
      WE BESEECH thee, O Lord, that the mysteries which we have received:
      may cleanse us from all our sins; and defend us by thy gifts
      bestowed therein from all adversities. [Through.]<br />
