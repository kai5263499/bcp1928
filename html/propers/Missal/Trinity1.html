        <b>INTROIT. <i>Domine, in tua misericordia. Ps. 13 </i></b><br />
      O LORD, my trust in thy mercy:
      and my heart is joyful in thy salvation: I will sing of the Lord,
      because he hath dealt so lovingly with me. <i>Ps. ibid. </i>How
      long wilt thou forget me, O Lord, for ever? How long wilt thou
      hide thy face from me? V. Glory be.</p>
    <p><b>COLLECT.</b><br />
      O GOD, the strength of all those who put their trust in thee,
      mercifully accept our prayers: and because through the weakness
      of our mortal nature we can do no good thing without thee, grant
      us the help of thy grace; that in keeping thy commandments, we
      may please thee both in will and deed; through Jesus Christ our
      Lord. AMEN.</p>
    <p><b>EPISTLE.<i> 1 John 4:7-21</i></b><br />
      7 Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every
      one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.<br />
      8 He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.<br />
      9 In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that
      God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might
      live through him.<br />
      10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us,
      and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.<br />
      11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.<br />
      12 No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another,
      God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.<br />
      13 Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because
      he hath given us of his Spirit.<br />
      14 And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son
      to be the Saviour of the world.<br />
      15 Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God
      dwelleth in him, and he in God.<br />
      16 And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us.
      God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and
      God in him.<br />
      17 Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness
      in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.<br />
      18 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear:
      because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect
      in love.<br />
      19 We love him, because he first loved us.<br />
      20 If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a
      liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how
      can he love God whom he hath not seen?<br />
      21 And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth
      God love his brother also.</p>
    <p><b>GRADUAL. <i>Ps. 41 </i></b>I said: Lord, be merciful unto
      me: heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee. V. Blessed
      is he that considereth the poor and needy: the Lord shall deliver
      him in the time of trouble.<br />
      Alleluia, alleluia. V. <i>Ps. 5. </i>Ponder my words, O Lord:
      consider my meditation. Alleluia.</p>
    <p>GOSPEL. <i>St. Luke</i> 16:19-31<br />
      19 AT that time; Jesus spake
      this parable unto his disciples: There was a certain rich man,
      which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously
      every day:<br />
      20 And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid
      at his gate, full of sores,<br />
      21 And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the
      rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.<br />
      22 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried
      by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and
      was buried;<br />
      23 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth
      Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.<br />
      24 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and
      send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water,
      and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.<br />
      25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime
      receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things:
      but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.<br />
      26 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf
      fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot;
      neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.<br />
      27 Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest
      send him to my father's house:<br />
      28 For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest
      they also come into this place of torment.<br />
      29 Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets;
      let them hear them.<br />
      30 And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them
      from the dead, they will repent.<br />
      31 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets,
      neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.</p>
    <p><b>OFFERTORY. <i>Ps. 5. </i></b>O hearken thou unto the voice
      of my calling, my King and my God: for unto thee, O Lord, will
      I make my prayer.</p>
    <p><b>SECRET.</b><br />
      WE BESEECH thee, O Lord, graciously to accept this our sacrifice
      which we offer unto thee: that the same may effectually avail
      for our succour unto everlasting life. Through.</p>
    <p><b>COMMUNION.</b> <i>Ps. 9. </i>I will speak of all thy marvellous
      works: I will be glad and rejoice in thee: yea, my songs will
      I make of thy Name, O thou Most Highest.</p>
    <p><b>POSTCOMMUNION.</b><br />
      O LORD, who hast vouchsafed to fulfil us with thy wondrous bounty:
      grant, we beseech thee, that we receiving these gifts of our
      redemption may never cease from shewing forth thy praises. Through.<br />
