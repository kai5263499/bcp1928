    <p>O LORD, who hast taught us that all our doings without charity
      are nothing worth; Send thy Holy Ghost, and pour into our hearts
      that most excellent gift of charity, the very bond of peace and
      of all virtues, without which whosoever liveth is counted dead
      before thee. Grant this for thine only Son Jesus Christ's sake.
      Amen.<br />

        The Epistle. 1 Corinthians xiii. 1.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>THOUGH I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and
      have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling
      cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand
      all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith,
      so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am
      nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and
      though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it
      profiteth me nothing. Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity
      envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth
      not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily
      provoked, thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth
      in the truth; beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth
      all things, endureth all things. Charity never faileth: but whether
      there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues,
      they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish
      away. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. But when
      that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall
      be done away. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood
      as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I
      put away childish things. For now we see through a glass, darkly;
      but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know
      even as also I am known. And now abideth faith, hope, charity,
      these three; but the greatest of these is charity.<br />

        The Gospel. St. Luke xviii. 31.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>THEN Jesus took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold,
      we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the
      prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished. For
      he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked,
      and spitefully entreated, and spitted on: and they shall scourge
      him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again.
      And they understood none of these things: and this saying was
      hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.
      And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a
      certain blind man sat by the way-side begging: and hearing the
      multitude pass by, he asked what it meant. And they told him,
      that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by. And he cried, saying, Jesus,
      thou son of David, have mercy on me. And they which went before
      rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much
      the more, Thou son of David, have mercy on me. And Jesus stood,
      and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come
      near, he asked him, saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto
      thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight. And Jesus
      said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.
      And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying
      God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God.</p>
