    <p>GRANT, we beseech thee, Almighty God, that we, who for our
      evil deeds do worthily deserve to be punished, by the comfort
      of thy grace may mercifully be relieved; through our Lord and
      Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.<br />

        The Epistle. Galatians iv. 21.
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>TELL me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear
      the law? For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one
      by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman. But he who was of the
      bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was
      by promise. Which things are an allegory: for these are the two
      covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage,
      which is Agar. For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth
      to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.
      But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of
      us all. For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest
      not: break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate
      hath many more children than she which hath an husband. Now we,
      brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise. But as then
      he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born
      after the Spirit, even so it is now. Nevertheless what saith
      the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son
      of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.
      So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but
      of the free.<br />

        The Gospel. St. John vi. 1.

    <p>JESUS went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.
      And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles
      which he did on them that were diseased. And Jesus went up into
      a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples. And the passover,
      a feast of the Jews, was nigh. When Jesus then lifted up his
      eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip,
      Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat? And this he said
      to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do. Philip answered
      him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them,
      that every one of them may take a little. One of his disciples,
      Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him, There is a lad
      here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but
      what are they among so many? And Jesus said, Make the men sit
      down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down,
      in number about five thousand. And Jesus took the loaves; and
      when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and
      the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the
      fishes as much as they would. When they were filled, he said
      unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that
      nothing be lost. Therefore they gathered them together, and filled
      twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves,
      which remained over and above unto them that had eaten. Then
      those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said,
      This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.</p>
