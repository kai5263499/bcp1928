      <P>O ETERNAL God, we humbly beseech thee, favourably to behold
      these thy servants now (or about to be) joined in wedlock according
      to thy holy ordinance; and grant that they, seeking first thy
      kingdom and thy righteousness, may obtain the manifold blessings
      of thy grace; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>The Epistle. Ephesians v. 20.</CENTER></P>

      <P>GIVE thanks always for all things unto God and the Father
      in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; submitting yourselves one
      to another in the fear of God. Wives, submit yourselves unto
      your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head
      of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he
      is the saviour of the body. Therefore as the church is subject
      unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every
      thing. Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the
      church, and gave himself for it; that he might sanctify and cleanse
      it with the washing of water by the word, that he might present
      it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle,
      or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
      So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that
      loveth his wife loveth himself. For no man ever yet hated his
      own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord
      the church: for we are members of his body, of his flesh, and
      of his bones. For this cause shall a man leave his father and
      mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall
      be one flesh. This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning
      Christ and the church. Nevertheless let every one of you in particular
      so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence
      her husband.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>The Gospel. St. Matthew xix. 4.</CENTER></P>

      <P>JESUS answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that
      he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,
      and said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother,
      and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?
      Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore
      God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.</P>
