      <P>O ALMIGHTY God, who into the place of the traitor Judas didst
      choose thy faithful servant Matthias to be of the number of the
      twelve Apostles; Grant that thy Church, being alway preserved
      from false Apostles, may be ordered and guided by faithful and
      true pastors; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>For the Epistle. Acts i. 15.</CENTER></P>

      <P>IN those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples,
      and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred
      and twenty,) Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have
      been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake
      before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.
      For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.
      Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and
      falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his
      bowels gushed out. And it was known unto all the dwellers at
      Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue,
      Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written
      in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let
      no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take. Wherefore
      of these men which have companied with us all the time that the
      Lord Jesus went in and out among us, beginning from the baptism
      of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must
      one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection.
      And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed
      Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord,
      which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two
      thou hast chosen, that he may take part of this ministry and
      apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he
      might go to his own place. And they gave forth their lots; and
      the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven
      apostles.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>The Gospel. St. Matthew xi. 25.</CENTER></P>

      <P>AT that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father,
      Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things
      from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.
      Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight. All things
      are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son,
      but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the
      Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him. Come unto
      me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you
      rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and
      lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my
      yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</P>
