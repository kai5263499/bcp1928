      <H6><I>&para; At the Communion-time the Holy Table shall have
      upon it a fair white linen cloth. And the Priest, standing reverently
      before the Holy Table, shall say the Lord's Prayer and the Collect
      following, the People kneeling; but the Lord's Prayer may be
      omitted at the discretion of the Priest.</I></H6>

      <P><BR />
      Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom
      come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us
      this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we
      forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation,
      But deliver us from evil. Amen.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER><I>The Collect.</I></CENTER></P>

      <P>ALMIGHTY God, unto whom all hearts are open, all desires known,
      and from whom no secrets are hid; Cleanse the thoughts of our
      hearts by the inspiration of thy Holy Spirit, that we may perfectly
      love thee, and worthily magnify thy holy Name; through Christ
      our Lord. Amen.</P>

      <H6><I>&para; Then shall the Priest, turning to the People, rehearse
      distinctly The Ten Commandments; and the People, still kneeling,
      shall, after every Commandment, ask God mercy for their transgressions
      for the time past, and grace to keep the law for the time to
      come.<BR />
<BR />
      &para; And NOTE, That in rehearsing The Ten Commandments, the
      Priest may omit that part of the Commandment which is inset.<BR />
      &para; The Decalogue may be omitted, provided it be said at least
      one Sunday in each month. But NOTE, That whenever it is omitted,
      the Priest shall say the Summary of the Law, beginning, Hear
      what our Lord Jesus Christ</I></H6>

      <P><CENTER><A NAME="anchor3414594"></A><I>The Decalogue.</I></CENTER></P>

      <P>GOD spake these words, and said:<BR />
<BR />
      I am the LORD thy God; Thou shalt have none other gods but me.<BR />
<BR />
      <I>Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this
      law.</I><BR />
<BR />
      Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven image, nor the likeness
      of any thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath,
      or in the water under the earth; thou shalt not bow down to them,
      nor worship them;</P>

      <H5>for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, and visit the sins
      of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation
      of them that hate me; and show mercy unto thousands in them that
      love me and keep my commandments.</H5>

      <P><I><BR />
      Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this
      law.</I><BR />
<BR />
      Thou shalt not take the Name of the LORD thy God in vain</P>

      <H5>for the LORD will not hold him guiltless, that taketh his
      Name in vain.</H5>

      <P><BR />
      <I>Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this
      law.</I><BR />
<BR />
      Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath-day.</P>

      <H5>Six days shalt thou labour, and do all that thou hast to
      do; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the LORD thy God. In
      it thou shalt do no manner of work; thou, and thy son, and thy
      daughter, thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, thy cattle,
      and the stranger that is within thy gates. For in six days the
      LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is,
      and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the seventh
      day, and hallowed it.</H5>

      <P><I><BR />
      Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this
      law.</I><BR />
<BR />
      Honour thy father and thy mother;</P>

      <H5>that thy days may be long in the land which the LORD thy
      God giveth thee.</H5>

      <P><BR />
      <I>Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this
      law.</I><BR />
<BR />
      Thou shalt do no murder.<BR />
      <I><BR />
      Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this
      law.</I><BR />
<BR />
      Thou shalt not commit adultery.<BR />
      <I><BR />
      Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this
      law.</I><BR />
<BR />
      Thou shalt not steal.<BR />
      <I><BR />
      Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this
      law.</I><BR />
<BR />
      Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.<BR />
      <I><BR />
      Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this
      law.</I><BR />
<BR />
      Thou shalt not covet.</P>

      <H5>thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's
      wife, nor his servant, nor his maid, nor his ox, nor his ass,
      nor any thing that is his.</H5>

      <P><I><BR />
      Lord, have mercy upon us, and write all these thy laws in our
      hearts, we beseech thee.</I></P>

      <H6><CENTER><I>&para; Then may the Priest say,</I></CENTER></H6>

      <P><CENTER>Hear what our Lord Jesus Christ saith.</CENTER></P>

      <P>THOU shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with
      all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great
      commandment. And the second is like unto it; Thou shalt love
      thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all
      the Law and the Prophets.</P>

      <H6><CENTER><I>&para; Here, if the Decalogue hath been omitted,
      shall be said,</I></CENTER></H6>

      <P><CENTER>Lord, have mercy upon us.<BR />
      <I>Christ, have mercy upon us. </I><BR />
      Lord, have mercy upon us.</CENTER></P>

      <H6><CENTER><I>&para; Then the Priest may say,</I></CENTER></H6>

      <P><BR />
      O ALMIGHTY Lord, and everlasting God, vouchsafe, we beseech thee,
      to direct, sanctify, and govern, both our hearts and bodies,
      in the ways of thy laws, and in the works of thy commandments;
      that, through thy most mighty protection, both here and ever,
      we may be preserved in body and soul; through our Lord and Saviour
      Jesus Christ. Amen.</P>

      <H6><CENTER><I>&para; Here shall be said,</I></CENTER></H6>

      <P><BR />
      The Lord be with you.<BR />
      Answer. And with thy spirit.<BR />
      Minister. Let us pray.</P>

      <H6><I>&para; Then shall the Priest say the Collect of the Day.
      And after the Collect the Minister appointed shall read the Epistle,
      first saying, The Epistle is written in the--Chapter of--, beginning
      at the--Verse. The Epistle ended, he shall say, Here endeth the
      Epistle.<BR />
<BR />
      &para; Here may be sung a Hymn or an Anthem.<BR />
<BR />
      &para; Then, all the People standing, the Minister appointed
      shall read the Gospel, first saying, The Holy Gospel is written
      in the--Chapter of--, beginning at the--Verse.</I></H6>

      <H6><CENTER>&para; Here shall be said,</CENTER></H6>

      <P><CENTER><BR />
      Glory be to thee, O Lord.</CENTER></P>

      <H6><CENTER><I>&para; And after the Gospel may be said,</I></CENTER></H6>

      <P><CENTER><BR />
      <A NAME="anchor470962"></A>Praise be to thee, O Christ.</CENTER></P>

      <H6><I>&para; Then shall be said the Creed commonly called the
      Nicene, or else the Apostles' Creed but the Creed may be omitted,
      if it hath been said immediately before in Morning Prayer; Provided,
      That the Nicene Creed shall be said on Christmas Day, Easter
      Day, Ascension Day, Whitsunday, and Trinity Sunday.</I></H6>

      <P><BR />
      I BELIEVE in one God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and
      earth, And of all things visible and invisible:<BR />
<BR />
      And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God; Begotten
      of his Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light,
      Very God of very God; Begotten, not made; Being of one substance
      with the Father; By whom all things were made: Who for us men
      and for our salvation came down from heaven, And was incarnate
      by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin Mary, And was made man: And was
      crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered and was
      buried: And the third day he rose again according to the Scriptures:
      And ascended into heaven, And sitteth on the right hand of the
      Father: And he shall come again, with glory, to judge both the
      quick and the dead; Whose kingdom shall have no end.<BR />
<BR />
      And I believe in the Holy Ghost, The Lord, and Giver of Life,
      Who proceedeth from the Father and the Son; Who with the Father
      and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; Who spake by
      the Prophets: And I believe one Catholic and Apostolic Church:
      I acknowledge one Baptism for the remission of sins: And I look
      for the Resurrection of the dead: And the Life of the world to
      come. Amen.</P>

      <H6><I><BR />
      &para; Then shall be declared unto the People what Holy Days,
      or Fasting Days, are in the week following to be observed; and
      (if occasion be) shall Notice be given of the Communion, and
      of the Banns of Matrimony, and of other matters to be published.<BR />
<BR />
      &para; Here, or immediately after the Creed, may be said the
      Bidding Prayer, or other authorized prayers and intercessions.<BR />
<BR />
      &para; Then followeth the Sermon. After which, the Priest, when
      there is a Communion, shall return to the Holy Table, and begin
      the Offertory, saying one or more of these Sentences following,
      as he thinketh most convenient.</I></H6>

      <P><BR />
<BR />
      REMEMBER the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more
      blessed to give than to receive. Acts xx. 35.<BR />
      Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good
      works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. St. Matt.
      v. 16.<BR />
      Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and
      rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:
      but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither
      moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through
      nor steal. St. Matt. vi. 19, 20.<BR />
      Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into
      the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father
      which is in heaven. St. Matt. vii. 21.<BR />
      He that soweth little shall reap little; and he that soweth plenteously
      shall reap plenteously. Let every man do according as he is disposed
      in his heart, not grudgingly, or of necessity; for God loveth
      a cheerful giver. 2 Cor. ix. 6, 7.<BR />
      While we have time, let us do good unto all men; and especially
      unto them that are of the household of faith. Gal. vi. 10.<BR />
      God is not unrighteous, that he will forget your works, and labour
      that proceedeth of love; which love ye have showed for his Name's
      sake, who have ministered unto the saints, and yet do minister.
      Heb. vi. 10.<BR />
      To do good, and to distribute, forget not; for with such sacrifices
      God is well pleased. Heb. xiii. 16.<BR />
      Whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need,
      and shutteth up his compassion from him, how dwelleth the love
      of God in him? 1 St. John iii. 17.<BR />
      Be merciful after thy power. If thou hast much, give plenteously;
      if thou hast little, do thy diligence gladly to give of that
      little: for so gatherest thou thyself a good reward in the day
      of necessity. Tobit iv. 8, 9.<BR />
      And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto
      you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these
      my brethren, ye have done it unto me. St. Matt. xxv. 40.<BR />
      How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?
      and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?
      and how shall they hear without a preacher? and how shall they
      preach, except they be sent? Rom. x. 14, 15.<BR />
      Jesus said unto them, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the
      labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest,
      that he send forth labourers into his harvest. St. Luke x. 2.<BR />
      Ye shall not appear before the LORD empty; every man shall give
      as he is able, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God
      which he hath given thee. Deut. xvi. 16, 17.<BR />
      Thine, O LORD, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory,
      and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven
      and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and
      thou art exalted as head above all. 1 Chron. xxix. 11.<BR />
      All things come of thee, O LORD, and of thine own have we given
      thee. 1 Chron. xxix. 14.</P>

      <H6><I>&para; And NOTE, That these Sentences may be used on any
      other occasion of Public Worship when the Offerings of the People
      are to be received.<BR />
<BR />
      &para; The Deacons, Church-wardens, or other fit persons appointed
      for that purpose, shall receive the Alms for the Poor, and other
      Offerings of the People, in a decent Basin to be provided by
      the Parish; and reverently bring it to the Priest, who shall
      humbly present and place it upon the Holy Table.<BR />
<BR />
      &para; And the Priest shall then offer, and shall place upon
      the Holy Table, the Bread and the Wine.<BR />
<BR />
      &para; And when the Alms and Oblations are being received and
      presented, there may be sung a Hymn, or an Offertory Anthem in
      the words of Holy Scripture or of the Book of Common Prayer,
      under the direction of the Priest.<BR />
<BR />
      &para; Here the Priest may ask the secret intercessions of the
      Congregation for any who have desired the prayers of the Church.<BR />
<BR />
      &para; Then shall the Priest say,</I></H6>

      <P><BR />
      <A NAME="anchor428211"></A>Let us pray for the whole state of
      Christ's Church.<BR />
<BR />
      ALMIGHTY and everliving God, who by thy holy Apostle hast taught
      us to make prayers, and supplications, and to give thanks for
      all men; We humbly beseech thee most mercifully to accept our
      [alms and] oblations, and to receive these our prayers, which
      we offer unto thy Divine Majesty; beseeching thee to inspire
      continually the Universal Church with the spirit of truth, unity,
      and concord: And grant that all those who do confess thy holy
      Name may agree in the truth of thy holy Word, and live in unity
      and godly love.<BR />
<BR />
      <A NAME="anchor2715703"></A>We beseech thee also, so to direct
      and dispose the hearts of all Christian Rulers, that they may
      truly and impartially administer justice, to the punishment of
      wickedness and vice, and to the maintenance of thy true religion,
      and virtue.<BR />
<BR />
      Give grace, O heavenly Father, to all Bishops and other Ministers,
      that they may, both by their life and doctrine, set forth thy
      true and lively Word, and rightly and duly administer thy holy
      Sacraments.<BR />
<BR />
      And to all thy People give thy heavenly grace; and especially
      to this congregation here present; that, with meek heart and
      due reverence, they may hear, and receive thy holy Word; truly
      serving thee in holiness and righteousness all the days of their
      life.<BR />
<BR />
      And we most humbly beseech thee, of thy goodness, O Lord, to
      comfort and succour all those who, in this transitory life, are
      in trouble, sorrow, need, sickness, or any other adversity.<BR />
<BR />
      And we also bless thy holy Name for all thy servants departed
      this life in thy faith and fear; beseeching thee to grant them
      continual growth in thy love and service, and to give us grace
      so to follow their good examples, that with them we may be partakers
      of thy heavenly kingdom. Grant this, O Father, for Jesus Christ's
      sake, our only Mediator and Advocate. Amen.</P>

      <H6><CENTER><I><BR />
      &para; Then shall the Priest say to those who come to receive
      the Holy Communion,</I></CENTER></H6>

      <P><BR />
      YE who do truly and earnestly repent you of your sins, and are
      in love and charity with your neighbours, and intend to lead
      a new life, following the commandments of God, and walking from
      henceforth in his holy ways; Draw near with faith, and take this
      holy Sacrament to your comfort; and make your humble confession
      to Almighty God, devoutly kneeling.</P>

      <H6><I>&para; Then shall this General Confession be made, by
      the Priest and all those who are minded to receive the Holy Communion,
      humbly kneeling.</I></H6>

      <P><BR />
      ALMIGHTY God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Maker of all things,
      Judge of all men; We acknowledge and bewail our manifold sins
      and wickedness, Which we, from time to time, most grievously
      have committed, By thought, word, and deed, Against thy Divine
      Majesty, Provoking most justly thy wrath and indignation against
      us. We do earnestly repent, And are heartily sorry for these
      our misdoings; The remembrance of them is grievous unto us; The
      burden of them is intolerable. Have mercy upon us, Have mercy
      upon us, most merciful Father; For thy Son our Lord Jesus Christ's
      sake, Forgive us all that is past; And grant that we may ever
      hereafter Serve and please thee In newness of life, To the honour
      and glory of thy Name; Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</P>

      <H6><I><BR />
      &para; Then shall the Priest (the Bishop if he be present) stand
      up, and turning to the People, say,</I></H6>

      <P><BR />
      ALMIGHTY God, our heavenly Father, who of his great mercy hath
      promised forgiveness of sins to all those who with hearty repentance
      and true faith turn unto him; Have mercy upon you; pardon and
      deliver you from all your sins; confirm and strengthen you in
      all goodness; and bring you to everlasting life; through Jesus
      Christ our Lord. Amen.</P>

      <H6><CENTER><I>&para; Then shall the Priest say,</I></CENTER></H6>

      <P><BR />
      Hear what comfortable words our Saviour Christ saith unto all
      who truly turn to him.<BR />
      COME unto me, all ye that travail and are heavy laden, and I
      will refresh you. St. Matt. xi. 28.<BR />
      So God loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, to
      the end that all that believe in him should not perish, but have
      everlasting life. St. John iii. 16.<BR />
<BR />
      Hear also what Saint Paul saith.<BR />
      This is a true saying, and worthy of all men to be received,
      That Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. 1 Tim.
      i. 15.<BR />
<BR />
      Hear also what Saint John saith.<BR />
      If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ
      the righteous; and he is the Propitiation for our sins. 1 St.
      John ii. 1, 2.</P>

      <H6><CENTER>&para; After which the Priest shall proceed, saying,</CENTER></H6>

      <P><BR />
      Lift up your hearts.<BR />
      Answer. We lift them up unto the Lord.<BR />
      Priest. Let us give thanks unto our Lord God.<BR />
      Answer. It is meet and right so to do.</P>

      <H6><CENTER><I><BR />
      &para; Then shall the Priest turn to the Holy Table, and say,</I></CENTER></H6>

      <P><BR />
      IT is very meet, right, and our bounden duty, that we should
      at all times, and in all places, give thanks unto thee, O Lord,
      Holy Father, Almighty, Everlasting God.</P>

      <H6><I>&para; Here shall follow the Proper Preface, according
      to the time, if there be any specially appointed; or else immediately
      shall be said or sung by the Priest,</I></H6>

      <P><BR />
      THEREFORE with Angels and Archangels, and with all the company
      of heaven, we laud and magnify thy glorious Name; evermore praising

      BECAUSE thou didst give Jesus Christ, thine only Son, to be born
      as at this time for us; who, by the operation of the Holy Ghost,
      was made very man, of the substance of the Virgin Mary his mother;
      and that without spot of sin, to make us clean from all sin.<BR />

      <P><BR />
      ALL glory be to thee, Almighty God, our heavenly Father, for
      that thou, of thy tender mercy, didst give thine only Son Jesus
      Christ to suffer death upon the Cross for our redemption; who
      made there (by his one oblation of himself once offered) a full,
      perfect, and sufficient sacrifice, oblation, and satisfaction,
      for the sins of the whole world; and did institute, and in his
      holy Gospel command us to continue, a perpetual memory of that
      his precious death and sacrifice, until his coming again: For
      in the night in which he was betrayed, he took Bread; and when
      he had given thanks, he brake it, and gave it to his disciples,
      saying, Take, eat, this is my Body, which is given for you; Do
      this in remembrance of me. Likewise, after supper, he took the
      Cup; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying,
      Drink ye all of this; for this is my Blood of the New Testament,
      which is shed for you, and for many, for the remission of sins;
      Do this, as oft as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of me.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER><I>The Oblation</I></CENTER></P>

      <P>WHEREFORE, O Lord and heavenly Father, according to the institution
      of thy dearly beloved Son our Saviour Jesus Christ, we, thy humble
      servants, do celebrate and make here before thy Divine Majesty,
      with these thy holy gifts, which we now offer unto thee, the
      memorial thy Son hath commanded us to make; having in remembrance
      his blessed passion and precious death, his mighty resurrection
      and glorious ascension; rendering unto thee most hearty thanks
      for the innumerable benefits procured unto us by the same.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER><I>The Invocation</I></CENTER></P>

      <P>AND we most humbly beseech thee, O merciful Father, to hear
      us; and, of thy almighty goodness, vouchsafe to bless and sanctify,
      with thy Word and Holy Spirit, these thy gifts and creatures
      of bread and wine; that we, receiving them according to thy Son
      our Saviour Jesus Christ's holy institution, in remembrance of
      his death and passion, may be partakers of his most blessed Body
      and Blood.<BR />
<BR />
      AND we earnestly desire thy fatherly goodness, mercifully to
      accept this our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving; most humbly
      beseeching thee to grant that, by the merits and death of thy
      Son Jesus Christ, and through faith in his blood, we, and all
      thy whole Church, may obtain remission of our sins, and all other
      benefits of his passion. <A NAME="anchor2342163"></A>And here
      we offer and present unto thee, O Lord, our selves, our souls
      and bodies, to be a reasonable, holy, and living sacrifice unto
      thee; humbly beseeching thee, that we, and all others who shall
      be partakers of this Holy Communion, may worthily receive the
      most precious Body and Blood of thy Son Jesus Christ, be filled
      with thy grace and heavenly benediction, and made one body with
      him, that he may dwell in us, and we in him. And although we
      are unworthy, through our manifold sins, to offer unto thee any
      sacrifice; yet we beseech thee to accept this our bounden duty
      and service; not weighing our merits, but pardoning our offences,
      through Jesus Christ our Lord; by whom, and with whom, in the
      unity of the Holy Ghost, all honour and glory be unto thee, O
      Father Almighty, world without end. Amen.<BR />
<BR />
      And now, as our Saviour Christ hath taught us, we are bold to
      say,<BR />
<BR />
      OUR Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom
      come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us
      this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we
      forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation,
      But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power,
      and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.</P>

      <H6><I><BR />
      &para; Then shall the Priest, kneeling down at the Lord's Table,
      say, in the name of all those who shall receive the Communion,
      this Prayer following.</I></H6>

      <P><BR />
      WE do not presume to come to this thy Table, O merciful Lord,
      trusting in our own righteousness, but in thy manifold and great
      mercies. We are not worthy so much as to gather up the crumbs
      under thy Table. But thou art the same Lord, whose property is
      always to have mercy: Grant us therefore, gracious Lord, so to
      eat the flesh of thy dear Son Jesus Christ, and to drink his
      blood, that our sinful bodies may be made clean by his body,
      and our souls washed through his most precious blood, and that
      we may evermore dwell in him, and he in us. Amen.</P>

      <H6><I><BR />
      &para; Here may be sung a Hymn.<BR />
<BR />
      &para; Then shall the Priest First receive the Holy Communion
      in both kinds him self, and proceed to deliver the same to the
      Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, in like manner, (if any be present,)
      and, after that, to the People also in order, into their hands,
      all devoutly kneeling. And sufficient opportunity shall be given
      to those present to communicate. And when he delivereth the Bread,
      he shall say,</I></H6>

      <P><BR />
      THE Body of our Lord Jesus Christ, which was given for thee,
      preserve thy body and soul unto everlasting life. Take and eat
      this in remembrance that Christ died for thee, and feed on him
      in thy heart by faith, with thanksgiving.</P>

      <H6><I><BR />
      &para; And the Minister who delivereth the Cup shall say,</I></H6>

      <P><BR />
      THE Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, which was shed for thee,
      preserve thy body and soul unto everlasting life. Drink this
      in remembrance that Christ's Blood was shed for thee, and be
      thankful.</P>

      <H6><I>&para; If the consecrated Bread or Wine be spent before
      all have communicated, the Priest is to consecrate more, according
      to the Form before prescribed; beginning at, All glory be to
      thee, Almighty God, and ending with these words, partakers of
      his most blessed Body and Blood.<BR />
<BR />
      &para; When an have communicated, the Priest shall return to
      the Lord's Table, and reverently place upon it what remaineth
      of the consecrated Elements, covering the same with a fair linen
      cloth.<BR />
<BR />
      &para; Then shall the Priest say,</I></H6>

      <P><BR />
      Let us pray.<BR />
      <A NAME="anchor111501"></A><BR />
      ALMIGHTY and everliving God, we most heartily thank thee, for
      that thou dost vouchsafe to feed us who have duly received these
      holy mysteries, with the spiritual food of the most precious
      Body and Blood of thy Son our Saviour Jesus Christ; and dost
      assure us thereby of thy favour and goodness towards us; and
      that we are very members incorporate in the mystical body of
      thy Son, which is the blessed company of all faithful people;
      and are also heirs through hope of thy everlasting kingdom, by
      the merits of his most precious death and passion. And we humbly
      beseech thee, O heavenly Father, so to assist us with thy grace,
      that we may continue in that holy fellowship, and do all such
      good works as thou hast prepared for us to walk in; through Jesus
      Christ our Lord, to whom, with thee and the Holy Ghost, be all
      honour and glory, world without end. Amen.</P>

      <H6><CENTER><I><BR />
      </I><A NAME="anchor473894"></A><I>&para; Then shall be said the
      Gloria in excelsis, all standing, or some proper Hymn.</I></CENTER></H6>

      <P><BR />
      GLORY be to God on high, and on earth peace, good will towards
      men. We praise thee, we bless thee, we worship thee, we glorify
      thee, we give thanks to thee for thy great glory, O Lord God,
      heavenly King, God the Father Almighty.<BR />
<BR />
      O Lord, the only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ; O Lord God, Lamb
      of God, Son of the Father, that takest away the sins of the world,
      have mercy upon us. Thou that takest away the sins of the world,
      receive our prayer. Thou that sittest at the right hand of God
      the Father, have mercy upon us.<BR />
<BR />
      For thou only art holy; thou only art the Lord; thou only, O
      Christ, with the Holy Ghost, art most high in the glory of God
      the Father. Amen.</P>

      <H6><I>&para; Then, the People kneeling, the Priest (the Bishop
      if he be present) shall let them depart with this Blessing.</I></H6>

      <P><BR />
      THE Peace of God, which passeth all understanding, keep your
      hearts and minds in the knowledge and love of God, and of his
      Son Jesus Christ our Lord: And the Blessing of God Almighty,
      the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, be amongst you, and
      remain with you always. Amen.<BR />
      </P>

      <P><CENTER>GENERAL RUBRICS.</CENTER></P>

      <H6><I>&para; In the absence of a Priest, a Deacon may say all
      that is before appointed unto the end of the Gospel.<BR />
<BR />
      &para; Upon the Sundays and other Holy Days, (though there be
      no Sermon or Communion,) may be said all that is appointed at
      the Communion, unto the end of the Gospel, concluding with the
      Blessing.<BR />
<BR />
      &para; And if any of the consecrated Bread and Wine remain after
      the Communion, it shall not be carried out of the Church; but
      the Minister and other Communicants shall, immediately after
      the Blessing, reverently eat and drink the same.<BR />
<BR />
      &para; If among those who come to be partakers of the Holy Communion,
      the Minister shall know any to be an open and notorious evil
      liver, or to have done any wrong to his neighbours by word or
      deed, so that the Congregation be thereby offended; he shall
      advertise him, that he presume not to come to the Lord's Table,
      until he have openly declared himself to have truly repented
      and amended his former evil life, that the Congregation may thereby
      be satisfied; and that he hath recompensed the parties to whom
      he hath done wrong; or at least declare himself to be in full
      purpose so to do, as soon as he conveniently may.<BR />
<BR />
      &para; The same order shall the Minister use with those, betwixt
      whom he perceiveth malice and hatred to reign; not suffering
      them to be partakers of the Lord's Table, until he know them
      to be reconciled. And if one of the parties, so at variance,
      be content to forgive from the bottom of his heart all that the
      other hath trespassed against him, and to make amends for that
      wherein he himself hath offended; and the other party will not
      be persuaded to a godly unity, but remain still in his frowardness
      and malice; the Minister in that case ought to admit the penitent
      person to the Holy Communion, and not him that is obstinate.
      Provided, That every Minister so repelling any, as is herein
      specified, shall be obliged to give an account of the same to
      the Ordinary, within fourteen days after, at the farthest.</I></H6>

      <P><CENTER>THE EXHORTATIONS.</CENTER></P>

      <H6>&para; At the time of the Celebration of the Communion, after
      the prayer for the whole state of Christ's Church, the Priest
      may say this Exhortation. And NOTE, That the Exhortation shall
      be said on the First Sunday in Advent, the First Sunday in Lent,
      and Trinity Sunday.</H6>

      <P><BR />
      DEARLY beloved in the Lord, ye who mind to come to the holy Communion
      of the Body and Blood of our Saviour Christ, must consider how
      Saint Paul exhorteth all persons diligently to try and examine
      themselves, before they presume to eat of that Bread, and drink
      of that Cup. For as the benefit is great, if with a true penitent
      heart and lively faith we receive that holy Sacrament; so is
      the danger great, if we receive the same unworthily. Judge therefore
      yourselves, brethren, that ye be not judged of the Lord; repent
      you truly for your sins past; have a lively and stedfast faith
      in Christ our Saviour; amend your lives, and be in perfect charity
      with all men; so shall ye be meet partakers of those holy mysteries.
      And above all things ye must give most humble and hearty thanks
      to God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, for the redemption
      of the world by the death and passion of our Saviour Christ,
      both God and man; who did humble himself, even to the death upon
      the Cross, for us, miserable sinners, who lay in darkness and
      the shadow of death; that he might make us the children of God,
      and exalt us to everlasting life. And to the end that we should
      always remember the exceeding great love of our Master, and only
      Saviour, Jesus Christ, thus dying for us, and the innumerable
      benefits which by his precious blood-shedding he hath obtained
      for us; he hath instituted and ordained holy mysteries, as pledges
      of his love, and for a continual remembrance of his death, to
      our great and endless comfort. To him therefore, with the Father
      and the Holy Ghost, let us give, as we are most bounden, continual
      thanks; submitting ourselves wholly to his holy will and pleasure,
      and studying to serve him in true holiness and righteousness
      all the days of our life. Amen.</P>

      <H6><I><BR />
      &para; When the Minister giveth warning for the Celebration of
      the Holy Communion, (which he shall always do upon the Sunday,
      or some Holy Day, immediately preceding,) he shall read this
      Exhortation following; or so much thereof as, in his discretion,
      he may think convenient.</I></H6>

<noscript><img src="http://stats.superstats.com/b/ss/DAVIDMCMANNES/1" alt="" border=0></noscript><!-- End Superstats tracking code. --></noscript><!-- End Superstats tracking code. --> I purpose, through God's assistance,
      to administer to all such as shall be religiously and devoutly
      disposed the most comfortable Sacrament of the Body and Blood
      of Christ; to be by them received in remembrance of his meritorious
      Cross and Passion; whereby alone we obtain remission of our sins,
      and are made partakers of the Kingdom of heaven. Wherefore it
      is our duty to render most humble and hearty thanks to Almighty
      God, our heavenly Father, for that he hat given his Son our Saviour
      Jesus Christ, not only to die for us, but also to be our spiritual
      food and sustenance in that holy Sacrament. Which being so divine
      and comfortable a thing to them who receive it worthily, and
      so dangerous to those who will presume to receive it unworthily;
      my duty is to exhort you, in the mean season to consider the
      dignity of that holy mystery, and the great peril of the unworthy
      receiving thereof; and so to search and examine your own consciences,
      and that not lightly, and after the manner of dissemblers with
      God; but so that ye may come holy and clean to such a heavenly
      Feast, in the marriage-garment required by God in holy Scripture,
      and be received as worthy partakers of that holy Table.<BR />
<BR />
      The way and means thereto is: First, to examine your lives and
      conversations by the rule of God's commandments; and whereinsoever
      ye shall perceive yourselves to have offended, either by will,
      word, or deed, there to bewail your own sinfulness, and to confess
      yourselves to Almighty God, with full purpose of amendment of
      life. And if ye shall perceive your offences to be such as are
      not only against God, but also against your neighbours; then
      ye shall reconcile yourselves unto them; being ready to make
      restitution and satisfaction, according to the uttermost of your
      powers, for all injuries and wrongs done by you to any other;
      and being likewise ready to forgive others who have offended
      you, as ye would have forgiveness of your offences at God's hand:
      for otherwise the receiving of the holy Communion doth nothing
      else but increase your condemnation. Therefore, if any of you
      be a blasphemer of God, an hinderer or slanderer of his Word,
      an adulterer, or be in malice, or envy, or in any other grievous
      crime; repent you of your sins, or else come not to that holy
      Table.<BR />
<BR />
      And because it is requisite that no man should come to the holy
      Communion, but with a full trust in God's mercy, and with a quiet
      conscience; therefore, if there be any of you, who by this means
      cannot quiet his own conscience herein, but requireth further
      comfort or counsel, let him come to me, or to some other Minister
      of God's Word, and open his grief; that he may receive such godly
      counsel and advice, as may tend to the quieting of his conscience,
      and the removing of all scruple and doubtfulness.</P>

      <H6><I><BR />
      &para; Or, in case he shall see the People negligent to come
      to the Holy Communion, instead of the former, he may use this
      Exhortation.</I></H6>

      <P><BR />
      DEARLY beloved brethren, on--I intend, by God's grace, to celebrate
      the Lord's Supper: unto which, in God's behalf, I bid you all
      who are here present; and beseech you, for the Lord Jesus Christ's
      sake, that ye will not refuse to come thereto, being so lovingly
      called and bidden by God himself. Ye know how grievous and unkind
      a thing it is, when a man hath prepared a rich feast, decked
      his table with all kind of provision, so that there lacketh nothing
      but the guests to sit down; and yet they who are called, without
      any cause, most unthankfully refuse to come. Which of you in
      such a case would not be moved? Who would not think a great injury
      and wrong done unto him? Wherefore, most dearly beloved in Christ,
      take ye good heed, lest ye, withdrawing yourselves from this
      holy Supper, provoke God's indignation against you. It is an
      easy matter for a man to say, I will not communicate, because
      I am otherwise hindered with worldly business. But such excuses
      are not so easily accepted and allowed before God. If any man
      say, I am a grievous sinner, and therefore am afraid to come:
      wherefore then do ye not repent and amend? When God calleth you,
      are ye not ashamed to say ye will not come? When ye should return
      to God, will ye excuse yourselves, and say ye are not ready?
      Consider earnestly with yourselves how little such feigned excuses
      will avail before God. Those who refused the feast in the Gospel,
      because they had bought a farm, or would try their yokes of oxen,
      or because they were married, were not so excused, but counted
      unworthy of the heavenly feast. Wherefore, according to mine
      office, I bid you in the Name of God, I call you in Christ's
      behalf, I exhort you, as ye love your own salvation, that ye
      will be partakers of this holy Communion. And as the Son of God
      did vouchsafe to yield up his soul by death upon the Cross for
      your salvation; so it is your duty to receive the Communion in
      remembrance of the sacrifice of his death, as he himself hath
      commanded: which if ye shall neglect to do, consider with yourselves
      how great is your ingratitude to God, and how sore punishment
      hangeth over your heads for the same; when ye wilfully abstain
      from the Lord's Table, and separate from your brethren, who come
      to feed on the banquet of that most heavenly food. These things
      if ye earnestly consider, ye will by God's grace return to a
      better mind: for the obtaining whereof we shall not cease to
      make our humble petitions unto Almighty God, our heavenly Father.<BR />
