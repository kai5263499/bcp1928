      WHEN the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria
      had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:
      who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might
      receive the Holy Ghost: for as yet he was fallen upon none of
      them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
      Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy
      Ghost.</P>

      <H6><CENTER><I>&para; Then shall the Bishop say,</I></CENTER></H6>

      <P>DO ye here, in the presence of God, and of this con gregation,
      renew the solemn promise and vow that ye made, or that was made
      in your name, at your Baptism; ratifying and confirming the same;
      and acknowledging yourselves bound to believe and to do all those
      things which ye then undertook, or your Sponsors then undertook
      for you?</P>

      <H6><CENTER><I>&para; And every one shall audibly answer,</I></CENTER></H6>

      <P><CENTER><BR>

      ALMIGHTY and everliving God, who hast vouchsafed to regenerate
      these thy servants by Water and the Holy Ghost, and hast given
      unto them forgiveness of all their sins; Strengthen them, we
      beseech thee, O Lord, with the Holy Ghost, the Comforter, and
      daily increase in them thy manifold gifts of grace: the spirit
      of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and ghostly
      strength, the spirit of knowledge and true godliness; and fill
      them, O Lord, with the spirit of thy holy fear, now and for ever.
      <I>Amen.</I></P>

      Spirit more and more, until he come unto thy everlasting kingdom.
      Amen.</P>

      <P><BR>
      OUR Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom
      come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us
      this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we
      forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation,
      But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power,
      and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.</P>

      <H6><CENTER><I>&para; Then shall the Bishop say,</I></CENTER></H6>

      <P>ALMIGHTY and everliving God, who makest us both to will and
      to do those things which are good, and acceptable unto thy Divine
      Majesty; We make our humble supplications unto thee for these
      thy servants, upon whom, after the example of thy holy Apostles,
      we have now laid our hands, to certify them, by this sign, of
      thy favour and gracious goodness towards them. Let thy fatherly
      hand, we beseech thee, ever be over them; let thy Holy Spirit
      ever be with them; and so lead them in the knowledge and obedience
      of thy Word, that in the end they may obtain everlasting life;
      through our Lord Jesus Christ, who with thee and the same Holy
      Spirit liveth and reigneth ever, one God, world without end.<I>
      Amen.</I><BR>
<BR>
      O ALMIGHTY Lord, and everlasting God, vouchsafe, we beseech thee,
      to direct, sanctify, and govern, both our hearts and bodies,
      in the ways of thy laws, and in the works of thy commandments;
      that, through thy most mighty protection, both here and ever,
      we may be pre served in body and soul; through our Lord and Saviour
      Jesus Christ. Amen.</P>

      <H6><CENTER><I>&para; Then the Bishop shall bless them, saying
      thus,</I></CENTER></H6>

      <P>THE Blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the
