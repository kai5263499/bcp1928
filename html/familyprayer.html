Mercy and Preservation,<BR />especially through the Night past.</FONT></I></B></CENTER></p><P>ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, in whom we live and move and
have our being; We, thy needy creatures, render thee our humble
praises, for thy preservation of us from the beginning of our
lives to this day, and especially for having delivered us from
the dangers of the past night. For these thy mercies, we bless
and magnify thy glorious Name; humbly beseeching thee to accept
this our morning sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving; for his
sake who lay down in the grave, and rose again for us, thy Son
our Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.<BR /></p><P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR=#ff0000>Dedication of Soul and
Body to God's Service,<BR />with a Resolution to be growing daily in Goodness.</FONT></I></B></CENTER></p><P>AND since it is of thy mercy, O gracious Father, that another
day is added to our lives; We here dedicate both our souls and
our bodies to thee and thy service, in a sober, righteous, and
godly life: in which resolution, do thou, O merciful God, confirm
and strengthen us; that, as we grow in age, we may grow in grace,
and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.<BR /></p><P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR=#ff0000>Prayer for Grace to enable
us to perform that Resolution.</FONT></I></B></CENTER></p><P>BUT, O God, who knowest the weakness and corruption of our
nature, and the manifold temptations which we daily meet with;
We humbly beseech thee to have compassion on our infirmities,
and to give us the constant assistance of thy Holy Spirit; that
we may be effectually restrained from sin, and incited to our
duty. Imprint upon our hearts such a dread of thy judgments,
and such a grateful sense of thy goodness to us, as may make
us both afraid and ashamed to offend thee. And, above all, keep
in our minds a lively remembrance of that great day, in which
we must give a strict account of our thoughts, words, and actions
to him whom thou hast appointed the Judge of quick and dead,
thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<BR /></p><P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR=#ff0000>For Grace to guide and

ensuing day. Keep us temperate in all things, and diligent in
our several callings. Grant us patience under our afflictions.
Give us grace to be just and upright in all our dealings; quiet
and peaceable; full of compassion; and ready to do good to all
men, according to our abilities and opportunities. Direct us
in all our ways. Defend us from all dangers and adversities;
and be graciously pleased to take us, and all who are dear to
us, under thy fatherly care and protection. These things, and
whatever else thou shalt see to be necessary and convenient to
us, we humbly beg, through the merits and mediation of thy Son
Jesus Christ, our Lord and Saviour. Amen.<BR /><BR />THE grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and
the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. Amen.<BR /></p><P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR=#ff0000>EVENING PRAYER.</FONT></B></CENTER></P><H6><I><BR />&para; The Family being together, a little before bedtime, let

a Prayer for Contrition and Pardon.</FONT></I></CENTER></p><P>MOST merciful God, who art of purer eyes than to behold iniquity,
and hast promised forgiveness to all those who confess and forsake
their sins; We come before thee in an humble sense of our own
unworthiness, acknowledging our manifold transgressions of thy
righteous laws.[Here let him who reads make a short pause, that
every one may secretly confess the sins and failings of that
day] But, O gracious Father, who desirest not the death of a
sinner, look upon us, we beseech thee, in mercy, and forgive
us all our transgressions. Make us deeply sensible of the great
evil of them; and work in us an hearty contrition; that we may
obtain forgiveness at thy hands, who art ever ready to receive
humble and penitent sinners; for the sake of thy Son Jesus Christ,
our only Saviour and Redeemer. Amen.<BR /></p><P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR=#ff0000>Prayer for Grace to reform
and grow Better.</FONT></I></B></CENTER></p><P>AND lest, through our own frailty, or the temptations which
encompass us, we be drawn again into sin, vouchsafe us, we beseech
thee, the direction and assistance of thy Holy Spirit. Reform
whatever is amiss in the temper and disposition of our souls;
that no unclean thoughts, unlawful designs, or inordinate desires,
may rest there. Purge our hearts from envy, hatred, and malice;
that we may never suffer the sun to go down upon our wrath; but
may always go to our rest in peace, charity, and good-will, with
a conscience void of offence towards thee, and towards men; that
so we may be preserved pure and blameless, unto the coming of
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.<BR /></p><P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR=#ff0000>The Intercession.</FONT></I></B></CENTER></p><P>AND accept, O Lord, our intercessions for all mankind. Let
the light of thy Gospel shine upon all nations; and may as many
as have received it, live as becomes it. Be gracious unto thy
Church; and grant that every member of the same, in his vocation
and ministry, may serve thee faithfully. Bless all in authority
over us; and so rule their hearts and strengthen their hands,
that they may punish wickedness and vice, and maintain thy true
religion and virtue. Send down thy blessings, temporal and spiritual,
upon all our relations, friends, and neighbours. Reward all who
have done us good, and pardon all those who have done or wish
us evil, and give them repentance and better minds. Be merciful
to all who are in any trouble; and do thou, the God of pity,
administer to them according to their several necessities; for
his sake who went about doing good, thy Son our Saviour Jesus
Christ. Amen.<BR /></p><P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR=#ff0000>The Thanksgiving.</FONT></I></B></CENTER></p><P>TO our prayers, O Lord, we join our unfeigned thanks for all
thy mercies; for our being, our reason, and all other endowments
and faculties of soul and body; for our health, friends, food,
and raiment, and all the other comforts and conveniences of life.
Above all, we adore thy mercy in sending thy only Son into the
world, to redeem us from sin and eternal death, and in giving
us the knowledge and sense of our duty towards thee. We bless
thee for thy patience with us, notwithstanding our many and great
provocations; for all the directions, assistances, and comforts
of thy Holy Spirit; for thy continual care and watchful providence
over us through the whole course of our lives; and particularly
for the mercies and benefits of the past day; beseeching thee
to continue these thy blessings to us, and to give us grace to
show our thankfulness in a sincere obedience to his laws, through
whose merits and intercession we received them all, thy Son our
Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.<BR /></p><P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR=#ff0000>Prayer for God's Protection
through the Night following.</FONT></I></B></CENTER></p><P>IN particular, we beseech thee to continue thy gracious protection
to us this night. Defend us from all dangers and mischiefs, and
from the fear of them; that we may enjoy such refreshing sleep
as may fit us for the duties of the coming day. And grant us
grace always to live in such a state that we may never be afraid
to die; so that, living and dying, we may be thine, through the
merits and satisfaction of thy Son Christ Jesus, in whose Name
we offer up these our imperfect prayers. Amen.<BR /><BR />THE grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and
the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. Amen.<BR /><I><BR />&para; On Sundays, and on other days when it may be convenient,

hast safely brought us to the beginning of this day; Defend us
in the same with thy mighty power; and grant that this day we
fall into no sin, neither run into any kind of danger; but that
all our doings, being ordered by thy governance, may be righteous
in thy sight; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<BR /></p><P><CENTER><B>EVENING<BR /></B><I>&para; Here may be added any special Prayers.</I></CENTER></p><P>THE grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and

and turnest the shadow of death into the morning; Drive far off
from us all wrong desires, incline our hearts to keep thy law,
and guide our feet into the way of peace; that having done thy
will with cheerfulness while it was day, we may, when the night
cometh, rejoice to give thee thanks; through Jesus Christ our
Lord. Amen.<BR /><BR />ALMIGHTY God, who alone gavest us the breath of life, and alone
canst keep alive in us the holy desires thou dost impart; We
beseech thee, for thy compassion's sake, to sanctify all our
thoughts and endeavours; that we may neither begin an action
without a pure intention nor continue it without thy blessing.
And grant that, having the eyes of the mind opened to behold
things invisible and unseen, we may in heart be inspired by thy

grant us a safe lodging, and a holy rest, and peace at the last.
Amen.<BR /><BR />O GOD, who art the life of mortal men, the light of the faithful,

all who by reason of weakness are overtasked, or because of poverty
