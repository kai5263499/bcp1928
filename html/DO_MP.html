      <P><BR />
      Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be
      alway acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength and my redeemer.
      Psalm xix. 14.<BR />
<BR />
      O send out thy light and thy truth, that they may lead me, and
      bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy dwelling. Psalm xliii.
      3.<BR />
<BR />
      Thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose
      name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also
      that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit
      of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.
      Isaiah Ivii. 15.<BR />
<BR />
      The hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall
      worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh
      such to worship him. St. John iv. 23.</P>

      <P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&para; then follows,</FONT></CENTER></P>

      <P>O Lord, open thou our lips.<BR />
      <B>And our mouth shall show forth thy praise.</B><BR />
      Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;<BR />
      <B>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world
      without end. Amen.</B><BR />
      Praise ye the Lord.<BR />
      <B>The Lord's Name be praised.</B></P>

      <P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&para; then follows,</FONT></CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Venite, exultemus Domino.</B><BR />
      O COME, let us sing unto the LORD; * let us heartily rejoice
      in the strength of our salvation.<BR />
      Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving; * and show
      ourselves glad in him with psalms.<BR />
      For the LORD is a great God; * and a great King above all gods.<BR />
      In his hand are all the corners of the earth; * and the strength
      of the hills is his also.<BR />
      The sea is his, and he made it; * and his hands prepared the
      dry land.<BR />
      O come, let us worship and fall down, * and kneel before the
      LORD our Maker.<BR />
      For he is the Lord our God; * and we are the people of his pasture,
      and the sheep of his hand.<BR />
      O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness; * let the whole
      earth stand in awe of him.<BR />
      For he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth; * and with righteousness
      to judge the world, and the peoples with his truth.<BR />
      Glory be.<BR />

      <P><B><BR />
      Jubilate Deo. Psalm c.</B><BR />
      O be joyful in the LORD, all ye lands: * serve the LORD with
      gladness, and come before his presence with a song.<BR />
      Be ye sure that the LORD he is God; it is he that hath made us,
      and not we ourselves; * we are his people, and the sheep of his
      pasture.<BR />
      O go your way into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his
      courts with praise; * be thankful unto him, and speak good of
      his Name.<BR />
      For the LORD is gracious, his mercy is everlasting; * and his
      truth endureth from generation to generation.<BR />
      Glory be.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>The Apostles' Creed.</B><BR />
      I Believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth:<BR />
      And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord: Who was conceived
      by the Holy Ghost, Born of the Virgin Mary: Suffered under Pontius
      Pilate, Was crucified, dead, and buried: He descended into hell;
      The third day he rose again from the dead: He ascended into heaven,
      And sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty: From
      thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.<BR />
<BR />
      I believe in the Holy Ghost: The holy Catholic Church; The Communion
      of Saints: The Forgiveness of sins: The Resurrection of the body:
      And the Life everlasting. Amen.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>The Lord's Prayer.</B><BR />
      Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom
      come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us
      this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we
      forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation,
      But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power,
      and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.<BR />
<BR />
      O Lord, show thy mercy upon us.<BR />
      <B>And grant us thy salvation.</B><BR />
      O God, make clean our hearts within us.<BR />
      <B>And take not thy Holy Spirit from us.<BR />

      </FONT><B>A Collect for Peace.</B><BR />
      O God, who art the author of peace and lover of concord, in knowledge
      of whom standeth our eternal life, whose service is perfect freedom;
      Defend us thy humble servants in all assaults of our enemies;
      that we, surely trusting in thy defence, may not fear the power
      of any adversaries, through the might of Jesus Christ our Lord.
      Amen.<BR />

      A Collect for Grace.</B><BR />
      O Lord, our heavenly Father, Almighty and everlasting God, who
      hast safely brought us to the beginning of this day; Defend us
      in the same with thy mighty power; and grant that this day we
      fall into no sin, neither run into any kind of danger; but that
      all our doings, being ordered by thy governance, may be righteous
      in thy sight; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</P>

      <P><B>A Prayer for all Conditions of Men.</B><BR />
      O God, the Creator and Preserver of all mankind, we humbly beseech
      thee for all sorts and conditions of men; that thou wouldest
      be pleased to make thy ways known unto them, thy saving health
      unto all nations. More especially we pray for thy holy Church
      universal; that it may be so guided and governed by thy good
      Spirit, that all who profess and call themselves Christians may
      be led into the way of truth, and hold the faith in unity of
      spirit, in the bond of peace, and in righteousness of life. Finally,
      we commend to thy fatherly goodness all those who are any ways
      afflicted, or distressed, in mind, body, or estate; that it may
      please thee to comfort and relieve them, according to their several
      necessities; giving them patience under their sufferings, and
      a happy issue out of all their afflictions. And this we beg for
      Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.<BR />
      <B><BR />
      2 Cor. xiii. 14.</B><BR />
      THE grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and
      the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. Amen.</P>
