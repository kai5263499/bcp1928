      <P><B>Psalms 14. Dixit insipiens.</B><BR>
      THE fool hath said in his heart, * There is no God.<BR>
      2 They are corrupt, and become abominable in their doings; *
      there is none that doeth good, no not one.<BR>
      3 The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men,
      * to see if there were any that would understand, and seek after
      God.<BR>
      4 But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become
      abominable; * there is none that doeth good, no not one.<BR>
      5 Have they no knowledge, that they are all such workers of mischief,
      * eating up my people as it were bread, and call not upon the
      LORD?<BR>
      6 There were they brought in great fear, even where no fear was;
      * for God is in the generation of the righteous.<BR>
      7 As for you, ye have made a mock at the counsel of the poor;
      * because he putteth his trust in the LORD.<BR>
      8 Who shall give salvation unto Israel out of Sion? * When the
      LORD turneth the captivity of his people, then shall Jacob rejoice,
      and Israel shall be glad.
