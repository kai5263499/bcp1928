      <P><B>Psalm 74. Ut quid, Deus?</B><BR>
      O GOD, wherefore art thou absent from us so long? * why is thy
      wrath so hot against the sheep of thy pasture?<BR>
      2 O think upon thy congregation, * whom thou hast purchased,
      and redeemed of old.<BR>
      3 Think upon the tribe of thine inheritance, * and Mount Sion,
      wherein thou hast dwelt.<BR>
      4 Lift up thy feet, that thou mayest utterly destroy every enemy,
      * which hath done evil in thy sanctuary.<BR>
      5 Thine adversaries roar in the midst of thy congregations, *
      and set up their banners for tokens.<BR>
      6 He that hewed timber afore out of the thick trees, * was known
      to bring it to an excellent work.<BR>
      7 But now they break down all the carved work thereof * with
      axes and hammers.<BR>
      8 They have set fire upon thy holy places, * and have defiled
      the dwelling-place of thy Name, even unto the ground.<BR>
      9 Yea, they said in their hearts, Let us make havoc of them altogether:
      * thus have they burnt up all the houses of God in the land.<BR>
      10 We see not our tokens; there is not one prophet more; * no,
      not one is there among us, that understandeth any more.<BR>
      11 O God, how long shall the adversary do this dishonour? * shall
      the enemy blaspheme thy Name for ever?<BR>
      12 Why withdrawest thou thy hand? * why pluckest thou not thy
      right hand out of thy bosom to consume the enemy?<BR>
      13 For God is my King of old; * the help that is done upon earth,
      he doeth it himself.<BR>
      14 Thou didst divide the sea through thy power; * thou brakest
      the heads of the dragons in the waters.<BR>
      15 Thou smotest the heads of leviathan in pieces, * and gavest
      him to be meat for the people of the wilderness.<BR>
      16 Thou broughtest out fountains and waters out of the hard rocks;
      * thou driedst up mighty waters.<BR>
      17 The day is thine, and the night is thine; * thou hast prepared
      the light and the sun.<BR>
      18 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth; * thou hast made
      summer and winter.<BR>
      19 Remember this, O LORD, how the enemy hath rebuked; * and how
      the foolish people hath blasphemed thy Name.<BR>
      20 O deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the multitude
      of the enemies; * and forget not the congregation of the poor
      for ever.<BR>
      21 Look upon the covenant; * for all the earth is full of darkness
      and cruel habitations.<BR>
      22 O let not the simple go away ashamed; * but let the poor and
      needy give praise unto thy Name.<BR>
      23 Arise, O God, maintain thine own cause; * remember how the
      foolish man blasphemeth thee daily.<BR>
      24 Forget not the voice of thine enemies: * the presumption of
      them that hate thee increaseth ever more and more.
