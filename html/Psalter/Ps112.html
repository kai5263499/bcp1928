      <P><B>Psalm 112. Beatus vir.</B><BR>
      BLESSED is the man that feareth the LORD; * he hath great delight
      in his commandments.<BR>
      2 His seed shall be mighty upon earth; * the generation of the
      faithful shall be blessed.<BR>
      3 Riches and plenteousness shall be in his house; * and his righteousness
      endureth for ever.<BR>
      4 Unto the godly there ariseth up light in the darkness; * he
      is merciful, loving, and righteous.<BR>
      5 A good man is merciful, and lendeth; * and will guide his words
      with discretion.<BR>
      6 For he shall never be moved: * and the righteous shall be had
      in everlasting remembrance.<BR>
      7 He will not be afraid of any evil tidings; * for his heart
      standeth fast, and believeth in the LORD.<BR>
      8 His heart is stablished, and will not shrink, * until he see
      his desire upon his enemies.<BR>
      9 He hath dispersed abroad, and given to the poor. * and his
      righteousness remaineth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with
      honour.<BR>
      10 The ungodly shall see it, and it shall grieve him; * he shall
      gnash with his teeth, and consume away; the desire of the ungodly
      shall perish.
