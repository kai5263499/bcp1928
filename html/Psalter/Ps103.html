      <P><B>Psalm 103. Benedic, anima mea.</B><BR>
      PRAISE the LORD, O my soul; * and all that is within me, praise
      his holy Name.<BR>
      2 Praise the LORD, O my soul, * and forget not all his benefits:<BR>
      3 Who forgiveth all thy sin, * and healeth all thine infirmities;<BR>
      4 Who saveth thy life from destruction, * and crowneth thee with
      mercy and loving-kindness;<BR>
      5 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things, * making thee young
      and lusty as an eagle.<BR>
      6 The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment * for all them
      that are oppressed with wrong.<BR>
      7 He showed his ways unto Moses, * his works unto the children
      of Israel.<BR>
      8 The LORD is full of compassion and mercy, * longsuffering,
      and of great goodness.<BR>
      9 He will not alway be chiding; * neither keepeth he his anger
      for ever.<BR>
      10 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; * nor rewarded us
      according to our wickednesses.<BR>
      11 For look how high the heaven is in comparison of the earth;
      * so great is his mercy also toward them that fear him.<BR>
      12 Look how wide also the east is from the west; * so far hath
      he set our sins from us.<BR>
      13 Yea, like as a father pitieth his own children; * even so
      is the LORD merciful unto them that fear him.<BR>
      14 For he knoweth whereof we are made; * he remembereth that
      we are but dust.<BR>
      15 The days of man are but as grass; * for he flourisheth as
      a flower of the field.<BR>
      16 For as soon as the wind goeth over it, it is gone; * and the
      place thereof shall know it no more.<BR>
      17 But the merciful goodness of the LORD endureth for ever and
      ever upon them that fear him; * and his righteousness upon children's
      children;<BR>
      18 Even upon such as keep his covenant, * and think upon his
      commandments to do them.<BR>
      19 The LORD hath prepared his seat in heaven, * and his kingdom
      ruleth over all.<BR>
      20 O praise the LORD, ye angels of his, ye that excel in strength;
      * ye that fulfil his commandment, and hearken unto the voice
      of his word.<BR>
      21 O praise the LORD, all ye his hosts; * ye servants of his
      that do his pleasure.<BR>
      22 O speak good of the LORD, all ye works of his, in all places
      of his dominion: * praise thou the LORD, O my soul.
