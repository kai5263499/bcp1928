      <P><B>Psalms 25<FONT COLOR="#000000"> </FONT>. Ad te, Domine,
      levavi.</B><BR>
      UNTO thee, O LORD, will I lift up my soul; my God, I have put
      my trust in thee: * O let me not be confounded, neither let mine
      enemies triumph over me.<BR>
      2 For all they that hope in thee shall not be ashamed; * but
      such as transgress without a cause shall be put to confusion.<BR>
      3 Show me thy ways, O LORD, * and teach me thy paths.<BR>
      4 Lead me forth in thy truth, and learn me: * for thou art the
      God of my salvation; in thee hath been my hope all the day long.<BR>
      5 Call to remembrance, O LORD, thy tender mercies, * and thy
      loving-kindnesses, which have been ever of old.<BR>
      6 O remember not the sins and offences of my youth; * but according
      to thy mercy think thou upon me, O LORD, for thy goodness.<BR>
      7 Gracious and righteous is the LORD; * therefore, will he teach
      sinners in the way.<BR>
      8 Them that are meek shall he guide in judgment; * and such as
      are gentle, them shall he learn his way.<BR>
      9 All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth, * unto such
      as keep his covenant and his testimonies.<BR>
      10 For thy Name's sake, O LORD, * be merciful unto my sin; for
      it is great.<BR>
      11 What man is he that feareth the LORD? * him shall he teach
      in the way that he shall choose.<BR>
      12 His soul shall dwell at ease, * and his seed shall inherit
      the land.<BR>
      13 The secret of the LORD is among them that fear him; * and
      he will show them his covenant.<BR>
      14 Mine eyes are ever looking unto the LORD; * for he shall pluck
      my feet out of the net.<BR>
      15 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; * for I am desolate,
      and in misery.<BR>
      16 The sorrows of my heart are enlarged: * O bring thou me out
      of my troubles.<BR>
      17 Look upon my adversity and misery, * and forgive me all my
      sin.<BR>
      18 Consider mine enemies, how many they are; * and they bear
      a tyrannous hate against me.<BR>
      19 O keep my soul, and deliver me: * let me not be confounded,
      for I have put my trust in thee.<BR>
      20 Let perfectness and righteous dealing wait upon me; * for
      my hope hath been in thee.<BR>
      21 Deliver Israel, O God, * out of all his troubles.
