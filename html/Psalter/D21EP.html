    <p><strong>Psalm 106. Confitemini Domino.</strong><br />
      O GIVE thanks unto the LORD; for he is gracious, * and his mercy endureth for ever.<br />
      2 Who can express the noble acts of the LORD, * or show forth all his praise?<br />
      3 Blessed are they that alway keep judgment, * and do righteousness.<br />
      4 Remember me, O LORD, according to the favour that thou bearest unto thy people; * O visit me with thy salvation;<br />
      5 That I may see the felicity of thy chosen, * and rejoice in the gladness of thy people, and give thanks with thine inheritance.<br />
      6 We have sinned with our fathers; * we have done amiss, and dealt wickedly.<br />
      7 Our fathers regarded not thy wonders in Egypt, neither kept they thy great goodness in remembrance; * but were disobedient at the sea, even at the Red Sea.<br />
      8 Nevertheless, he helped them for his Name's sake, * that he might make his power to be known.<br />
      9 He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up; * so he led them through the deep, as through a wilderness.<br />
      10 And he saved them from the adversary's hand, * and delivered them from the hand of the enemy.<br />
      11 As for those that troubled them, the waters overwhelmed them; * there was not one of them left.<br />
      12 Then believed they his words, * and sang praise unto him.<br />
      13 But within a while they forgat his works, * and would not abide his counsel.<br />
      14 But lust came upon them in the wilderness, * and they tempted God in the desert.<br />
      15 And he gave them their desire, * and sent leanness withal into their soul.<br />
      16 They angered Moses also in the tents, * and Aaron the saint of the LORD.<br />
      17 So the earth opened, and swallowed up Dathan, * and covered the congregation of Abiram.<br />
      18 And the fire was kindled in their company; * the flame burnt up the ungodly.<br />
      19 They made a calf in Horeb, * and worshipped the molten image.<br />
      20 Thus they turned their glory * into the similitude of a calf that eateth hay.<br />
      21 And they forgat God their Saviour, * who had done so great things in Egypt;<br />
      22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham; * and fearful things by the Red Sea.<br />
      23 So he said he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the gap, * to turn away his wrathful indignation, lest he should destroy them.<br />
      24 Yea, they thought scorn of that pleasant land, * and gave no credence unto his word;<br />
      25 But murmured in their tents, * and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.<br />
      26 Then lift he up his hand against them, * to overthrow them in the wilderness;<br />
      27 To cast out their seed among the nations, * and to scatter them in the lands.<br />
      28 They joined themselves unto Baal-peor, * and ate the offerings of the dead.<br />
      29 Thus they provoked him to anger with their own inventions; * and the plague was great among them.<br />
      30 Then stood up Phinehas, and interposed; * and so the plague ceased.<br />
      31 And that was counted unto him for righteousness, * among all posterities for evermore.<br />
      32 They angered him also at the waters of strife, * so that he punished Moses for their sakes;<br />
      33 Because they provoked his spirit, * so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.<br />
      34 Neither destroyed they the heathen, * as the LORD commanded them;<br />
      35 But were mingled among the heathen, * and learned their works.<br />
      36 Insomuch that they worshipped their idols, which became a snare unto them; * yea, they offered their sons and their daughters unto devils;<br />
      37 And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, * whom they offered unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was defiled with blood.<br />
      38 Thus were they stained with their own works, * and went a whoring with their own inventions.<br />
      39 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, * insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.<br />
      40 And he gave them over into the hand of the heathen; * and they that hated them were lords over them.<br />
      41 Their enemies oppressed them, * and had them in subjection.<br />
      42 Many a time did he deliver them; * but they rebelled against him with their own inventions, and were brought down in their wickedness.<br />
      43 Nevertheless, when he saw their adversity, * he heard their complaint.<br />
      44 He thought upon his covenant, and pitied them, according unto the multitude of his mercies; * yea, he made all those that led them away captive to pity them.<br />
      45 Deliver us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen; * that we may give thanks unto thy holy Name, and make our boast of thy praise.<br />
      46 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, from everlasting, and world without end; * And let all the people say, Amen.</p>
