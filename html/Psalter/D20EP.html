    <p><strong>Psalm 104. Benedic, anima mea.</strong><br />
      PRAISE the LORD, O my soul: * O LORD my God, thou art become exceeding glorious; thou art clothed with majesty and honour.<br />
      2 Thou deckest thyself with light as it were with a garment, * and spreadest out the heavens like a curtain.<br />
      3 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters, * and maketh the clouds his chariot, and walketh upon the wings of the wind.<br />
      4 He maketh his angels winds, * and his ministers a flaming fire.<br />
      5 He laid the foundations of the earth, * that it never should move at any time.<br />
      6 Thou coveredst it with the deep like as with a garment; * the waters stand above the hills.<br />
      7 At thy rebuke they flee; * at the voice of thy thunder they haste away.<br />
      8 They go up as high as the hills, and down to the valleys beneath; * even unto the place which thou hast appointed for them.<br />
      9 Thou hast set them their bounds, which they shall not pass, * neither turn again to cover the earth.<br />
      10 He sendeth the springs into the rivers, * which run among the hills.<br />
      11 All beasts of the field drink thereof, * and the wild asses quench their thirst.<br />
      12 Beside them shall the fowls of the air have their habitation, * and sing among the branches.<br />
      13 He watereth the hills from above; * the earth is filled with the fruit of thy works.<br />
      14 He bringeth forth grass for the cattle, * and green herb for the service of men;<br />
      15 That he may bring food out of the earth, and wine that maketh glad the heart of man; * and oil to make him a cheerful countenance, and bread to strengthen man's heart.<br />
      16 The trees of the LORD also are full of sap; * even the cedars of Lebanon which he hath planted;<br />
      17 Wherein the birds make their nests; * and the firtrees are a dwelling for the stork.<br />
      18 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; * and so are the stony rocks for the conies.<br />
      19 He appointed the moon for certain seasons, * and the sun knoweth his going down.<br />
      20 Thou makest darkness that it may be night; * wherein all the beasts of the forest do move.<br />
      21 The lions, roaring after their prey, * do seek their meat from God.<br />
      22 The sun ariseth, and they get them away together, * and lay them down in their dens.<br />
      23 Man goeth forth to his work, and to his labour, * until the evening.<br />
      24 O LORD, how manifold are thy works! * in wisdom hast thou made them all; the earth is full of thy riches.<br />
      25 So is the great and wide sea also; * wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.<br />
      26 There go the ships, and there is that leviathan, * whom thou hast made to take his pastime therein.<br />
      27 These wait all upon thee, * that thou mayest give them meat in due season.<br />
      28 When thou givest it them, they gather it; * and when thou openest thy hand, they are filled with good.<br />
      29 When thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: * when thou takest away their breath, they die, and are turned again to their dust.<br />
      30 When thou lettest thy breath go forth, they shall be made; * and thou shalt renew the face of the earth.<br />
      31 The glorious majesty of the LORD shall endure for ever; * the LORD shall rejoice in his works.<br />
      32 The earth shall tremble at the look of him; * if he do but touch the hills, they shall smoke.<br />
      33 I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live; * I will praise my God while I have my being.<br />
      34 And so shall my words please him: * my joy shall be in the LORD.<br />
      35 As for sinners, they shall be consumed out of the earth, * and the ungodly shall come to an end.<br />
    36 Praise thou the LORD, O my soul. * Praise the LORD.
