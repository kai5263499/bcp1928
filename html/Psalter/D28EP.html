    <p><strong>Psalm 136. Confitemini.</strong><br />
      O GIVE thanks unto the LORD, for he is gracious: * and his mercy endureth for ever.<br />
      2 O give thanks unto the God of all gods: * for his mercy endureth for ever.<br />
      3 O thank the Lord of all lords: * for his mercy endureth for ever.<br />
      4 Who only doeth great wonders: * for his mercy endureth for ever.<br />
      5 Who by his excellent wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy endureth for ever.<br />
      6 Who laid out the earth above the waters: * for his mercy endureth for ever.<br />
      7 Who hath made great lights: * for his mercy endureth for ever:<br />
      8 The sun to rule the day: * for his mercy endureth for ever;<br />
      9 The moon and the stars to govern the night: * for his mercy endureth for ever.<br />
      10 Who smote Egypt, with their firstborn: * for his mercy endureth for ever;<br />
      11 And brought out Israel from among them: * for his mercy endureth for ever;<br />
      12 With a mighty hand and stretched-out arm: * for his mercy endureth for ever.<br />
      13 Who divided the Red Sea in two parts: * for his mercy endureth for ever;<br />
      14 And made Israel to go through the midst of it: * for his mercy endureth for ever.<br />
      15 But as for Pharaoh and his host, he overthrew them in the Red Sea: * for his mercy endureth for ever.<br />
      16 Who led his people through the wilderness: * for his mercy endureth for ever.<br />
      17 Who smote great kings: * for his mercy endureth for ever;<br />
      18 Yea, and slew mighty kings: * for his mercy endureth for ever:<br />
      19 Sihon, king of the Amorites: * for his mercy endureth for ever;<br />
      20 And Og, the king of Bashan: * for his mercy endureth for ever;<br />
      21 And gave away their land for an heritage: * for his mercy endureth for ever;<br />
      22 Even for an heritage unto Israel his servant: * for his mercy endureth for ever.<br />
      23 Who remembered us when we were in trouble: * for his mercy endureth for ever;<br />
      24 And hath delivered us from our enemies: * for his mercy endureth for ever.<br />
      25 Who giveth food to all flesh: * for his mercy endureth for ever.<br />
      26 O give thanks unto the God of heaven: * for his mercy endureth for ever.<br />
      27 O give thanks unto the Lord of lords: * for his mercy endureth for ever.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 137. Super flumina.</strong><br />
      BY the waters of Babylon we sat down and wept, * when we remembered thee, O Sion.<br />
      2 As for our harps, we hanged them up * upon the trees that are therein.<br />
      3 For they that led us away captive, required of us then a song, and melody in our heaviness: * Sing us one of the songs of Sion.<br />
      4 How shall we sing the LORD'S song * in a strange land?<br />
      5 If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, * let my right hand forget her cunning.<br />
      6 If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; * yea, if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.<br />
      7 Remember the children of Edom, O LORD, in the day of Jerusalem; * how they said, Down with it, down with it, even to the ground.<br />
      8 O daughter of Babylon, wasted with misery; * yea, happy shall he be that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.<br />
      9 Blessed shall he be that taketh thy children, * and throweth them against the stones.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 138. Confitebor tibi.</strong><br />
      I WILL give thanks unto thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; * even before the gods will I sing praise unto thee.<br />
      2 I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy Name, because of thy loving-kindness and truth; * for thou hast magnified thy Name, and thy word, above all things.<br />
      3 When I called upon thee, thou heardest me; * and enduedst my soul with much strength.<br />
      4 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD; * for they have heard the words of thy mouth.<br />
      5 Yea, they shall sing of the ways of the LORD, * that great is the glory of the LORD.<br />
      6 For though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly; * as for the proud, he beholdeth them afar off.<br />
      7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, yet shalt thou refresh me; * thou shalt stretch forth thy hand upon the furiousness of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.<br />
    8 The LORD shall make good his loving-kindness toward me; * yea, thy mercy, O LORD, endureth for ever; despise not then the works of thine own hands.
