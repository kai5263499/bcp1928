    <p><strong>Psalm 82. Deus stetit.</strong><br />
      GOD standeth in the congregation of princes; * he is a Judge among gods.<br />
      2 How long will ye give wrong judgment, * and accept the persons of the ungodly?<br />
      3 Defend the poor and fatherless; * see that such as are in need and necessity have right.<br />
      4 Deliver the outcast and poor; * save them from the hand of the ungodly.<br />
      5 They know not, neither do they understand, but walk on still in darkness: * all the foundations of the earth are out of course.<br />
      6 I have said, Ye are gods, * and ye are all the children of the Most Highest.<br />
      7 But ye shall die like men, * and fall like one of the princes.<br />
      8 Arise, O God, and judge thou the earth; * for thou shalt take all nations to thine inheritance.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 83. Deus, quis similis?</strong><br />
      HOLD not thy tongue, O God, keep not still silence: * refrain not thyself, O God.<br />
      2 For lo, thine enemies make a murmuring; * and they that hate thee have lift up their head.<br />
      3 They have imagined craftily against thy people, * and taken counsel against thy secret ones.<br />
      4 They have said, Come, and let us root them out, that they be no more a people, * and that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.<br />
      5 For they have cast their heads together with one consent, * and are confederate against thee:<br />
      6 The tabernacles of the Edomites, and the Ishmaelites; * the Moabites, and Hagarenes;<br />
      7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; * the Philistines, with them that dwell at Tyre.<br />
      8 Assyria also is joined with them; * they have holpen the children of Lot.<br />
      9 But do thou to them as unto the Midianites; * unto Sisera, and unto Jabin at the brook of Kishon;<br />
      10 Who perished at Endor, * and became as the dung of the earth.<br />
      11 Make them and their princes like Oreb and Zeeb; * yea, make all their princes like as Zebah and Zalmunna;<br />
      12 Who say, Let us take to ourselves * the houses of God in possession.<br />
      13 O my God, make them like unto the whirling dust, * and as the stubble before the wind;<br />
      14 Like as the fire that burneth up the forest, * and as the flame that consumeth the mountains;<br />
      15 Pursue them even so with thy tempest, * and make them afraid with thy storm.<br />
      16 Make their faces ashamed, O LORD, * that they may seek thy Name.<br />
      17 Let them be confounded and vexed ever more and more; * let them be put to shame, and perish.<br />
      18 And they shall know that thou, whose Name is JEHOVAH, * art only the Most Highest over all the earth.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 84. Quam dilecta!</strong><br />
      O HOW amiable are thy dwellings, * thou LORD of hosts!<br />
      2 My soul hath a desire and longing to enter into the courts of the LORD; * my heart and my flesh rejoice in the living God.<br />
      3 Yea, the sparrow hath found her an house, and the swallow a nest, where she may lay her young; * even thy altars, O LORD of hosts, my King and my God.<br />
      4 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house; * they will be alway praising thee.<br />
      5 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; * in whose heart are thy ways.<br />
      6 Who going through the vale of misery use it for a well; * and the pools are filled with water.<br />
      7 They will go from strength to strength, * and unto the God of gods appeareth every one of them in Sion.<br />
      8 O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; * hearken, O God of Jacob.<br />
      9 Behold, O God our defender, * and look upon the face of thine anointed.<br />
      10 For one day in thy courts * is better than a thousand.<br />
      11 I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God, * than to dwell in the tents of ungodliness.<br />
      12 For the LORD God is a light and defence; * the LORD will give grace and worship; and no good thing shall he withhold from them that live a godly life.<br />
      13 O LORD God of hosts, * blessed is the man that putteth his trust in thee.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 85. Benedixisti, Domine.</strong><br />
      LORD, thou art become gracious unto thy land; * thou hast turned away the captivity of Jacob.<br />
      2 Thou hast forgiven the offence of thy people, * and covered all their sins.<br />
      3 Thou hast taken away all thy displeasure, * and turned thyself from thy wrathful indignation.<br />
      4 Turn us then, O God our Saviour, * and let thine anger cease from us.<br />
      5 Wilt thou be displeased at us for ever? * and wilt thou stretch out thy wrath from one generation to another?<br />
      6 Wilt thou not turn again, and quicken us, * that thy people may rejoice in thee?<br />
      7 Show us thy mercy, O LORD, * and grant us thy salvation.<br />
      8 I will hearken what the LORD God will say; * for he shall speak peace unto his people, and to his saints, that they turn not again unto foolishness.<br />
      9 For his salvation is nigh them that fear him; * that glory may dwell in our land.<br />
      10 Mercy and truth are met together: * righteousness and peace have kissed each other.<br />
      11 Truth shall flourish out of the earth, * and righteousness hath looked down from heaven.<br />
      12 Yea, the LORD shall show loving-kindness; * and our land shall give her increase.<br />
    13 Righteousness shall go before him, * and shall direct his going in the way.
