      <P><B>Psalms 1. Beatus vir qui non abiit.</B><BR>
      BLESSED is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the
      ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, * and hath not sat
      in the seat of the scornful.<BR>
      2 But his delight is in the law of the LORD; * and in his law
      will he exercise himself day and night.<BR>
      3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the water-side, * that
      will bring forth his fruit in due season.<BR>
      4 His leaf also shall not wither; * and look, whatsoever he doeth,
      it shall prosper.<BR>
      5 As for the ungodly, it is not so with them; * but they are
      like the chaff, which the wind scattereth away from the face
      of the earth.<BR>
      6 Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stand in the judgment,
      * neither the sinners in the congregation of the righteous.<BR>
      7 But the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous; * and the way
      of the ungodly shall perish.
