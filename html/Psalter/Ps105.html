      <P><B>Psalm 105. Confitemini Domino.</B><BR>
      GIVE thanks unto the LORD, and call upon his Name; * tell the
      people what things he hath done.<BR>
      2 O let your songs be of him, and praise him; * and let your
      talking be of all his wondrous works.<BR>
      3 Rejoice in his holy Name; * let the heart of them rejoice that
      seek the LORD.<BR>
      4 Seek the LORD and his strength; * seek his face evermore.<BR>
      5 Remember the marvellous works that he hath done; * his wonders,
      and the judgments of his mouth;<BR>
      6 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, * ye children of Jacob his
      chosen.<BR>
      7 He is the LORD our God; * his judgments are in all the world.<BR>
      8 He hath been alway mindful of his covenant and promise, * that
      he made to a thousand generations;<BR>
      9 Even the covenant that he made with Abraham; * and the oath
      that he sware unto Isaac;<BR>
      10 And appointed the same unto Jacob for a law, * and to Israel
      for an everlasting testament;<BR>
      11 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, * the lot
      of your inheritance:<BR>
      12 When there were yet but a few of them, * and they strangers
      in the land;<BR>
      13 What time as they went from one nation to another, * from
      one kingdom to another people;<BR>
      14 He suffered no man to do them wrong, * but reproved even kings
      for their sakes;<BR>
      15 Touch not mine anointed, * and do my prophets no harm.<BR>
      16 Moreover, he called for a dearth upon the land, * and destroyed
      all the provision of bread.<BR>
      17 But he had sent a man before them, * even Joseph, who was
      sold to be a bond-servant;<BR>
      18 Whose feet they hurt in the stocks; * the iron entered into
      his soul;<BR>
      19 Until the time came that his cause was known: * the word of
      the LORD tried him.<BR>
      20 The king sent, and delivered him; * the prince of the people
      let him go free.<BR>
      21 He made him lord also of his house, * and ruler of all his
      substance;<BR>
      22 That he might inform his princes after his will, * and teach
      his senators wisdom.<BR>
      23 Israel also came into Egypt, * and Jacob was a stranger in
      the land of Ham.<BR>
      24 And he increased his people exceedingly, * and made them stronger
      than their enemies;<BR>
      25 Whose heart turned so, that they hated his people, * and dealt
      untruly with his servants.<BR>
      26 Then sent he Moses his servant, * and Aaron whom he had chosen.<BR>
      27 And these showed his tokens among them, * and wonders in the
      land of Ham.<BR>
      28 He sent darkness, and it was dark; * and they were not obedient
      unto his word.<BR>
      29 He turned their waters into blood, * and slew their fish.<BR>
      30 Their land brought forth frogs; * yea, even in their kings'
      chambers.<BR>
      31 He spake the word, and there came all manner of flies, * and
      lice in all their quarters.<BR>
      32 He gave them hailstones for rain; * and flames of fire in
      their land.<BR>
      33 He smote their vines also and fig-trees; * and destroyed the
      trees that were in their coasts.<BR>
      34 He spake the word, and the grasshoppers came, and caterpillars
      innumerable, * and did eat up all the grass in their land, and
      devoured the fruit of their ground.<BR>
      35 He smote all the firstborn in their land; * even the chief
      of all their strength.<BR>
      36 He brought them forth also with silver and gold; * there was
      not one feeble person among their tribes.<BR>
      37 Egypt was glad at their departing; * for they were afraid
      of them.<BR>
      38 He spread out a cloud to be a covering, * and fire to give
      light in the night season.<BR>
      39 At their desire he brought quails; * and he filled them with
      the bread of heaven.<BR>
      40 He opened the rock of stone, and the waters flowed out, *
      so that rivers ran in the dry places.<BR>
      41 For why? he remembered his holy promise; * and Abraham his
      servant.<BR>
      42 And he brought forth his people with joy, * and his chosen
      with gladness;<BR>
      43 And gave them the lands of the heathen; * and they took the
      labours of the people in possession;<BR>
      44 That they might keep his statutes, * and observe his laws.
