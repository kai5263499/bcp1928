      <P><B>Psalm 73. Quam bonus Israel!</B><BR>
      TRULY God is loving unto Israel: * even unto such as are of a
      clean heart.<BR>
      2 Nevertheless, my feet were almost gone, * my treadings had
      well-nigh slipt.<BR>
      3 And why? I was grieved at the wicked: * I do also see the ungodly
      in such prosperity.<BR>
      4 For they are in no peril of death; * but are lusty and strong.<BR>
      5 They come in no misfortune like other folk; * neither are they
      plagued like other men.<BR>
      6 And this is the cause that they are so holden with pride, *
      and cruelty covereth them as a garment.<BR>
      7 Their eyes swell with fatness, * and they do even what they
      lust.<BR>
      8 They corrupt other, and speak of wicked blasphemy; * their
      talking is against the Most High.<BR>
      9 For they stretch forth their mouth unto the heaven, * and their
      tongue goeth through the world.<BR>
      10 Therefore fall the people unto them, * and thereout suck they
      no small advantage.<BR>
      11 Tush, say they, how should God perceive it? * is there knowledge
      in the Most High?<BR>
      12 Lo, these are the ungodly, * these prosper in the world, and
      these have riches in possession:<BR>
      13 And I said, Then have I cleansed my heart in vain, * and washed
      my hands in innocency.<BR>
      14 All the day long have I been punished, * and chastened every
      morning.<BR>
      15 Yea, and I had almost said even as they; * but lo, then I
      should have condemned the generation of thy children.<BR>
      16 Then thought I to understand this; * but it was too hard for
      me,<BR>
      17 Until I went into the sanctuary of God: * then understood
      I the end of these men;<BR>
      18 Namely, how thou dost set them in slippery places, * and castest
      them down, and destroyest them.<BR>
      19 O how suddenly do they consume, * perish, and come to a fearful
      end!<BR>
      20 Yea, even like as a dream when one awaketh; * so shalt thou
      make their image to vanish out of the city.<BR>
      21 Thus my heart was grieved, * and it went even through my reins.<BR>
      22 So foolish was I, and ignorant, * even as it were a beast
      before thee.<BR>
      23 Nevertheless, I am alway by thee; * for thou hast holden me
      by my right hand.<BR>
      24 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, * and after that receive
      me with glory.<BR>
      25 Whom have I in heaven but thee? * and there is none upon earth
      that I desire in comparison of thee.<BR>
      26 My flesh and my heart faileth; * but God is the strength of
      my heart, and my portion for ever.<BR>
      27 For lo, they that forsake thee shall perish; * thou hast destroyed
      all them that are unfaithful unto thee.<BR>
      28 But it is good for me to hold me fast by God, to put my trust
      in the Lord GOD, * and to speak of all thy works in the gates
      of the daughter of Sion.
