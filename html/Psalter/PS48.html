      <P><B>Psalms 48. Magnus Dominus.</B><BR>
      GREAT is the LORD, and highly to be praised * in the city of
      our God, even upon his holy hill.<BR>
      2 The hill of Sion is a fair place, and the joy of the whole
      earth; * upon the north side lieth the city of the great King:
      God is well known in her palaces as a sure refuge.<BR>
      3 For lo, the kings of the earth * were gathered, and gone by
      together.<BR>
      4 They marvelled to see such things; * they were astonished,
      and suddenly cast down.<BR>
      5 Fear came there upon them; and sorrow, * as upon a woman in
      her travail.<BR>
      6 Thou dost break the ships of the sea * through the east-wind.<BR>
      7 Like as we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD
      of hosts, in the city of our God; * God upholdeth the same for
      ever.<BR>
      8 We wait for thy loving-kindness, O God, * in the midst of thy
      temple.<BR>
      9 O God, according to thy Name, so is thy praise unto the world's
      end; * thy right hand is full of righteousness.<BR>
      10 Let the mount Sion rejoice, and the daughters of Judah be
      glad, * because of thy judgments.<BR>
      11 Walk about Sion, and go round about her; * and tell the towers
      thereof.<BR>
      12 Mark well her bulwarks, consider her palaces, * that ye may
      tell them that come after.<BR>
      13 For this God is our God for ever and ever: * he shall be our
      guide unto death.
