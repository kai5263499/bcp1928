      <P><B>Psalm 88. Domine, Deus.</B><BR>
      O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before
      thee: * O let my prayer enter into thy presence, incline thine
      ear unto my calling;<BR>
      2 For my soul is full of trouble, * and my life draweth nigh
      unto the grave.<BR>
      3 I am counted as one of them that go down into the pit, * and
      I am even as a man that hath no strength;<BR>
      4 Cast off among the dead, like unto them that are slain, and
      lie in the grave, * who are out of remembrance, and are cut away
      from thy hand.<BR>
      5 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, * in a place of darkness,
      and in the deep.<BR>
      6 Thine indignation lieth hard upon me, * and thou hast vexed
      me with all thy storms.<BR>
      7 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me, * and made
      me to be abhorred of them.<BR>
      8 I am so fast in prison * that I cannot get forth.<BR>
      9 My sight faileth for very trouble; * LORD, I have called daily
      upon thee, I have stretched forth my hands unto thee.<BR>
      10 Dost thou show wonders among the dead? * or shall the dead
      rise up again, and praise thee?<BR>
      11 Shall thy loving-kindness be showed in the grave? * or thy
      faithfulness in destruction?<BR>
      12 Shall thy wondrous works be known in the dark? * and thy righteousness
      in the land where all things are forgotten?<BR>
      13 Unto thee have I cried, O LORD; * and early shall my prayer
      come before thee.<BR>
      14 LORD, why abhorrest thou my soul, * and hidest thou thy face
      from me?<BR>
      15 I am in misery, and like unto him that is at the point to
      die; * even from my youth up, thy terrors have I suffered with
      a troubled mind.<BR>
      16 Thy wrathful displeasure goeth over me, * and the fear of
      thee hath undone me.<BR>
      17 They came round about me daily like water, * and compassed
      me together on every side.<BR>
      18 My lovers and friends hast thou put away from me, * and hid
      mine acquaintance out of my sight.
