      The Seventeenth Day.<BR>
<BR>
      Morning Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 86. Inclina, Domine.</B><BR>
      BOW down thine ear, O LORD, and hear me; * for I am poor, and
      in misery.<BR>
      2 Preserve thou my soul, for I am holy: * my God, save thy servant
      that putteth his trust in thee.<BR>
      3 Be merciful unto me, O Lord; * for I will call daily upon thee.<BR>
      4 Comfort the soul of thy servant; * for unto thee, O Lord, do
      I lift up my soul.<BR>
      5 For thou, Lord, art good and gracious, * and of great mercy
      unto all them that call upon thee.<BR>
      6 Give ear, LORD, unto my prayer, * and ponder the voice of my
      humble desires.<BR>
      7 In the time of my trouble I will call upon thee; * for thou
      hearest me.<BR>
      8 Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; * there
      is not one that can do as thou doest.<BR>
      9 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship thee,
      O Lord; * and shall glorify thy Name.<BR>
      10 For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: * thou art
      God alone.<BR>
      11 Teach me thy way, O LORD, and I will walk in thy truth: *
      O knit my heart unto thee, that I may fear thy Name.<BR>
      12 I will thank thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart; * and
      will praise thy Name for evermore.<BR>
      13 For great is thy mercy toward me; * and thou hast delivered
      my soul from the nethermost hell.<BR>
      14 O God, the proud are risen against me; * and the congregations
      of violent men have sought after my soul, and have not set thee
      before their eyes.<BR>
      15 But thou, O Lord God, art full of compassion and mercy, *
      long-suffering, plenteous in goodness and truth.<BR>
      16 O turn thee then unto me, and have mercy upon me; * give thy
      strength unto thy servant, and help the son of thine handmaid.<BR>
      17 Show some token upon me for good; that they who hate me may
      see it, and be ashamed, * because thou, LORD, hast holpen me,
      and comforted me.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 87. Fundamenta ejus.</B><BR>
      HER foundations are upon the holy hills: * the LORD loveth the
      gates of Sion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.<BR>
      2 Very excellent things are spoken of thee, * thou city of God.<BR>
      3 I will make mention of Egypt and Babylon, * among them that
      know me.<BR>
      4 Behold, Philistia also; and Tyre, with Ethiopia; * lo, in Sion
      were they born.<BR>
      5 Yea, of Sion it shall be reported, this one and that one were
      born in her; * and the Most High shall stablish her.<BR>
      6 The LORD shall record it, when he writeth up the peoples; *
      lo, in Sion were they born.<BR>
      7 The singers also and trumpeters shall make answer: * All my
      fresh springs are in thee.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 88. Domine, Deus.</B><BR>
      O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before
      thee: * O let my prayer enter into thy presence, incline thine
      ear unto my calling;<BR>
      2 For my soul is full of trouble, * and my life draweth nigh
      unto the grave.<BR>
      3 I am counted as one of them that go down into the pit, * and
      I am even as a man that hath no strength;<BR>
      4 Cast off among the dead, like unto them that are slain, and
      lie in the grave, * who are out of remembrance, and are cut away
      from thy hand.<BR>
      5 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, * in a place of darkness,
      and in the deep.<BR>
      6 Thine indignation lieth hard upon me, * and thou hast vexed
      me with all thy storms.<BR>
      7 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me, * and made
      me to be abhorred of them.<BR>
      8 I am so fast in prison * that I cannot get forth.<BR>
      9 My sight faileth for very trouble; * LORD, I have called daily
      upon thee, I have stretched forth my hands unto thee.<BR>
      10 Dost thou show wonders among the dead? * or shall the dead
      rise up again, and praise thee?<BR>
      11 Shall thy loving-kindness be showed in the grave? * or thy
      faithfulness in destruction?<BR>
      12 Shall thy wondrous works be known in the dark? * and thy righteousness
      in the land where all things are forgotten?<BR>
      13 Unto thee have I cried, O LORD; * and early shall my prayer
      come before thee.<BR>
      14 LORD, why abhorrest thou my soul, * and hidest thou thy face
      from me?<BR>
      15 I am in misery, and like unto him that is at the point to
      die; * even from my youth up, thy terrors have I suffered with
      a troubled mind.<BR>
      16 Thy wrathful displeasure goeth over me, * and the fear of
      thee hath undone me.<BR>
      17 They came round about me daily like water, * and compassed
      me together on every side.<BR>
      18 My lovers and friends hast thou put away from me, * and hid
      mine acquaintance out of my sight.<BR>

      <P><CENTER><A NAME="anchor451798"></A>Evening Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 89. Misericordias Domini</B>.<BR>
      MY song shall be alway of the loving-kindness of the LORD; *
      with my mouth will I ever be showing thy truth from one generation
      to another.<BR>
      2 For I have said, Mercy shall be set up for ever; * thy truth
      shalt thou stablish in the heavens.<BR>
      3 I have made a covenant with my chosen; * I have sworn unto
      David my servant:<BR>
      4 Thy seed will I stablish for ever, * and set up thy throne
      from one generation to another.<BR>
      5 O LORD, the very heavens shall praise thy wondrous works; *
      and thy truth in the congregation of the saints.<BR>
      6 For who is he among the clouds, * that shall be compared unto
      the LORD?<BR>
      7 And what is he among the gods, * that shall be like unto the
      LORD?<BR>
      8 God is very greatly to be feared in the council of the saints,
      * and to be had in reverence of all them that are round about
      him.<BR>
      9 O Lord God of hosts, who is like unto thee? * thy truth, most
      mighty LORD, is on every side.<BR>
      10 Thou rulest the raging of the sea; * thou stillest the waves
      thereof when they arise.<BR>
      11 Thou hast subdued Egypt, and destroyed it; * thou hast scattered
      thine enemies abroad with thy mighty arm.<BR>
      12 The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine; * thou hast
      laid the foundation of the round world, and all that therein
      is.<BR>
      13 Thou hast made the north and the south; * Tabor and Hermon
      shall rejoice in thy Name.<BR>
      14 Thou hast a mighty arm; * strong is thy hand, and high is
      thy right hand.<BR>
      15 Righteousness and equity are the habitation of thy seat; *
      mercy and truth shall go before thy face.<BR>
      16 Blessed is the people, O LORD, that can rejoice in thee; *
      they shall walk in the light of thy countenance.<BR>
      17 Their delight shall be daily in thy Name; * and in thy righteousness
      shall they make their boast.<BR>
      18 For thou art the glory of their strength, * and in thy loving-kindness
      thou shalt lift up our horns.<BR>
      19 For the LORD is our defence; * the Holy One of Israel is our
      King.<BR>
      20 Thou spakest sometime in visions unto thy saints, and saidst,
      * I have laid help upon one that is mighty, I have exalted one
      chosen out of the people.<BR>
      21 I have found David my servant; * with my holy oil have I anointed
      him.<BR>
      22 My hand shall hold him fast, * and my arm shall strengthen
      him.<BR>
      23 The enemy shall not be able to do him violence; * the son
      of wickedness shall not hurt him.<BR>
      24 I will smite down his foes before his face, * and plague them
      that hate him.<BR>
      25 My truth also and my mercy shall be with him; * and in my
      Name shall his horn be exalted.<BR>
      26 I will set his dominion also in the sea, * and his right hand
      in the floods.<BR>
      27 He shall call me, Thou art my Father, * my God, and my strong
      salvation.<BR>
      28 And I will make him my firstborn, * higher than the kings
      of the earth.<BR>
      29 My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, * and my covenant
      shall stand fast with him.<BR>
      30 His seed also will I make to endure for ever, * and his throne
      as the days of heaven.<BR>
      31 But if his children forsake my law, * and walk not in my judgments;<BR>
      32 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; *
      I will visit their offences with the rod, and their sin with
      scourges.<BR>
      33 Nevertheless, my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from
      him, * nor suffer my truth to fail.<BR>
      34 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is
      gone out of my lips: * I have sworn once by my holiness, that
      I will not fail David.<BR>
      35 His seed shall endure for ever, * and his throne is like as
      the sun before me.<BR>
      36 He shall stand fast for evermore as the moon, * and as the
      faithful witness in heaven.<BR>
      37 But thou hast abhorred and forsaken thine anointed, * and
      art displeased at him.<BR>
      38 Thou hast broken the covenant of thy servant, * and cast his
      crown to the ground.<BR>
      39 Thou hast overthrown all his hedges, * and broken down his
      strongholds.<BR>
      40 All they that go by spoil him, * and he is become a reproach
      to his neighbours.<BR>
      41 Thou hast set up the right hand of his enemies, * and made
      all his adversaries to rejoice.<BR>
      42 Thou hast taken away the edge of his sword, * and givest him
      not victory in the battle.<BR>
      43 Thou hast put out his glory, * and cast his throne down to
      the ground.<BR>
      44 The days of his youth hast thou shortened, * and covered him
      with dishonour.<BR>
      45 LORD, how long wilt thou hide thyself? for ever? * and shall
      thy wrath burn like fire?<BR>
      46 O remember how short my time is; * wherefore hast thou made
      all men for nought?<BR>
      47 What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? * and
      shall he deliver his soul from the power of the grave?<BR>
      48 Lord, where are thy old loving-kindnesses, * which thou swarest
      unto David in thy truth?<BR>
      49 Remember, Lord, the rebuke that thy servants have, * and how
      I do bear in my bosom the rebukes of many people;<BR>
      50 Wherewith thine enemies have blasphemed thee, * and slandered
      the footsteps of thine anointed.<BR>
      51 Praised be the LORD for evermore. * Amen, and Amen.</P>
