      <P><B>Psalm 80. Qui regis Israel.</B><BR>
      HEAR, O thou Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like
      a flock; * show thyself also, thou that sittest upon the Cherubim.<BR>
      2 Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, * stir up thy strength,
      and come and help us.<BR>
      3 Turn us again, O God; * show the light of thy countenance,
      and we shall be whole.<BR>
      4 O LORD God of hosts, * how long wilt thou be angry with thy
      people that prayeth?<BR>
      5 Thou feedest them with the bread of tears, * and givest them
      plenteousness of tears to drink.<BR>
      6 Thou hast made us a very strife unto our neighbours, * and
      our enemies laugh us to scorn.<BR>
      7 Turn us again, thou God of hosts; * show the light of thy countenance,
      and we shall be whole.<BR>
      8 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt; * thou hast cast out
      the heathen, and planted it.<BR>
      9 Thou madest room for it; * and when it had taken root, it filled
      the land.<BR>
      10 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, * and the boughs
      thereof were like the goodly cedar-trees.<BR>
      11 She stretched out her branches unto the sea, * and her boughs
      unto the River.<BR>
      12 Why hast thou then broken down her hedge, * that all they
      that go by pluck off her grapes?<BR>
      13 The wild boar out of the wood doth root it up, * and the wild
      beasts of the field devour it.<BR>
      14 Turn thee again, thou God of hosts, look down from heaven,
      * behold, and visit this vine;<BR>
      15 And the place of the vineyard that thy right hand hath planted,
      * and the branch that thou madest so strong for thyself.<BR>
      16 It is burnt with fire, and cut down; * and they shall perish
      at the rebuke of thy countenance.<BR>
      17 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, * and upon
      the son of man, whom thou madest so strong for thine own self.<BR>
      18 And so will not we go back from thee: * O let us live, and
      we shall call upon thy Name.<BR>
      19 Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts; * show the light of thy
      countenance, and we shall be whole.
