      <P><B>Psalm 63. Deus, Deus meus.</B><BR>
      O GOD, thou art my God; * early will I seek thee.<BR>
      2 My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh also longeth after thee,
      * in a barren and dry land where no water is.<BR>
      3 Thus have I looked for thee in the sanctuary, * that I might
      behold thy power and glory.<BR>
      4 For thy loving-kindness is better than the life itself: * my
      lips shall praise thee.<BR>
      5 As long as I live will I magnify thee in this manner, * and
      lift up my hands in thy Name.<BR>
      6 My soul shall be satisfied, even as it were with marrow and
      fatness, * when my mouth praiseth thee with joyful lips.<BR>
      7 Have I not remembered thee in my bed, * and thought upon thee
      when I was waking?<BR>
      8 Because thou hast been my helper; * therefore under the shadow
      of thy wings will I rejoice.<BR>
      9 My soul hangeth upon thee; * thy right hand hath upholden me.<BR>
      10 These also that seek the hurt of my soul, * they shall go
      under the earth.<BR>
      11 Let them fall upon the edge of the sword, * that they may
      be a portion for foxes.<BR>
      12 But the King shall rejoice in God; all they also that swear
      by him shall be commended; * for the mouth of them that speak
      lies shall be stopped.
