Quam bonus Israel!</B><BR />TRULY God is loving unto Israel: * even unto such as are of a
clean heart.<BR />2 Nevertheless, my feet were almost gone, * my treadings had well-nigh
slipt.<BR />3 And why? I was grieved at the wicked: * I do also see the ungodly
in such prosperity.<BR />4 For they are in no peril of death; * but are lusty and strong.<BR />5 They come in no misfortune like other folk; * neither are they
plagued like other men.<BR />6 And this is the cause that they are so holden with pride, *
and cruelty covereth them as a garment.<BR />7 Their eyes swell with fatness, * and they do even what they
lust.<BR />8 They corrupt other, and speak of wicked blasphemy; * their talking
is against the Most High.<BR />9 For they stretch forth their mouth unto the heaven, * and their
tongue goeth through the world.<BR />10 Therefore fall the people unto them, * and thereout suck they
no small advantage.<BR />11 Tush, say they, how should God perceive it? * is there knowledge
in the Most High?<BR />12 Lo, these are the ungodly, * these prosper in the world, and
these have riches in possession:<BR />13 And I said, Then have I cleansed my heart in vain, * and washed
my hands in innocency.<BR />14 All the day long have I been punished, * and chastened every
morning.<BR />15 Yea, and I had almost said even as they; * but lo, then I should
have condemned the generation of thy children.<BR />16 Then thought I to understand this; * but it was too hard for
me,<BR />17 Until I went into the sanctuary of God: * then understood I
the end of these men;<BR />18 Namely, how thou dost set them in slippery places, * and castest
them down, and destroyest them.<BR />19 O how suddenly do they consume, * perish, and come to a fearful
end!<BR />20 Yea, even like as a dream when one awaketh; * so shalt thou
make their image to vanish out of the city.<BR />21 Thus my heart was grieved, * and it went even through my reins.<BR />22 So foolish was I, and ignorant, * even as it were a beast before
thee.<BR />23 Nevertheless, I am alway by thee; * for thou hast holden me
by my right hand.<BR />24 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, * and after that receive
me with glory.<BR />25 Whom have I in heaven but thee? * and there is none upon earth
that I desire in comparison of thee.<BR />26 My flesh and my heart faileth; * but God is the strength of
my heart, and my portion for ever.<BR />27 For lo, they that forsake thee shall perish; * thou hast destroyed
all them that are unfaithful unto thee.<BR />28 But it is good for me to hold me fast by God, to put my trust
in the Lord GOD, * and to speak of all thy works in the gates
of the daughter of Sion.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 74. Ut quid, Deus?</B><BR />O GOD, wherefore art thou absent from us so long? * why is thy
wrath so hot against the sheep of thy pasture?<BR />2 O think upon thy congregation, * whom thou hast purchased, and
redeemed of old.<BR />3 Think upon the tribe of thine inheritance, * and Mount Sion,
wherein thou hast dwelt.<BR />4 Lift up thy feet, that thou mayest utterly destroy every enemy,
* which hath done evil in thy sanctuary.<BR />5 Thine adversaries roar in the midst of thy congregations, *
and set up their banners for tokens.<BR />6 He that hewed timber afore out of the thick trees, * was known
to bring it to an excellent work.<BR />7 But now they break down all the carved work thereof * with axes
and hammers.<BR />8 They have set fire upon thy holy places, * and have defiled
the dwelling-place of thy Name, even unto the ground.<BR />9 Yea, they said in their hearts, Let us make havoc of them altogether:
* thus have they burnt up all the houses of God in the land.<BR />10 We see not our tokens; there is not one prophet more; * no,
not one is there among us, that understandeth any more.<BR />11 O God, how long shall the adversary do this dishonour? * shall
the enemy blaspheme thy Name for ever?<BR />12 Why withdrawest thou thy hand? * why pluckest thou not thy
right hand out of thy bosom to consume the enemy?<BR />13 For God is my King of old; * the help that is done upon earth,
he doeth it himself.<BR />14 Thou didst divide the sea through thy power; * thou brakest
the heads of the dragons in the waters.<BR />15 Thou smotest the heads of leviathan in pieces, * and gavest
him to be meat for the people of the wilderness.<BR />16 Thou broughtest out fountains and waters out of the hard rocks;
* thou driedst up mighty waters.<BR />17 The day is thine, and the night is thine; * thou hast prepared
the light and the sun.<BR />18 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth; * thou hast made
summer and winter.<BR />19 Remember this, O LORD, how the enemy hath rebuked; * and how
the foolish people hath blasphemed thy Name.<BR />20 O deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the multitude
of the enemies; * and forget not the congregation of the poor
for ever.<BR />21 Look upon the covenant; * for all the earth is full of darkness
and cruel habitations.<BR />22 O let not the simple go away ashamed; * but let the poor and
needy give praise unto thy Name.<BR />23 Arise, O God, maintain thine own cause; * remember how the
foolish man blasphemeth thee daily.<BR />24 Forget not the voice of thine enemies: * the presumption of
them that hate thee increaseth ever more and more.<BR /></p><P><CENTER>The Fifteenth Day.<BR /><BR />Morning Prayer.</CENTER></p><P><B>Psalm 75. Confitebimur tibi.</B><BR />UNTO thee, O God, do we give thanks; * yea, unto thee do we give
thanks.<BR />2 Thy Name also is so nigh; * and that do thy wondrous works declare.<BR />3 In the appointed time, saith God, * I shall judge according
unto right.<BR />4 The earth is weak, and all the inhabiters thereof: * I bear
up the pillars of it.<BR />5 I said unto the fools, Deal not so madly; * and to the ungodly,
Set not up your horn.<BR />6 Set not up your horn on high, * and speak not with a stiff neck.<BR />7 For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west,
* nor yet from the south.<BR />8 And why? God is the Judge; * he putteth down one, and setteth
up another.<BR />9 For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is
red; * it is full mixt, and he poureth out of the same.<BR />10 As for the dregs thereof, * all the ungodly of the earth shall
drink them, and suck them out.<BR />11 But I will talk of the God of Jacob, * and praise him for ever.<BR />12 All the horns of the ungodly also will I break, * and the horns
of the righteous shall be exalted.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 76. Notus in Judaea.</B><BR />IN Judah is God known; * his Name is great in Israel.<BR />2 At Salem is his tabernacle, * and his dwelling in Sion.<BR />3 There brake he the arrows of the bow, * the shield, the sword,
and the battle.<BR />4 Thou art glorious in might, * when thou comest from the hills
of the robbers.<BR />5 The proud are robbed, they have slept their sleep; * and all
the men whose hands were mighty have found nothing.<BR />6 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, * both the chariot and horse
are fallen.<BR />7 Thou, even thou art to be feared; * and who may stand in thy
sight when thou art angry?<BR />8 Thou didst cause thy judgment to be heard from heaven; * the
earth trembled, and was still,<BR />9 When God arose to judgment, * and to help all the meek upon
earth.<BR />10 The fierceness of man shall turn to thy praise; * and the fierceness
of them shalt thou refrain.<BR />11 Promise unto the LORD your God, and keep it, all ye that are
round about him; * bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.<BR />12 He shall refrain the spirit of princes, * and is wonderful
among the kings of the earth.<BR /><B><BR />Psalm 77. Voce mea ad Dominum.</B><BR />I WILL cry unto God with my voice; * even unto God will I cry
with my voice, and he shall hearken unto me.<BR />2 In the time of my trouble I sought the Lord: * I stretched forth
my hands unto him, and ceased not in the night season; my soul
refused comfort.<BR />3 When I am in heaviness, I will think upon God; * when my heart
is vexed, I will complain.<BR />4 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: * I am so feeble that I cannot
speak.<BR />5 I have considered the days of old, * and the years that are
past.<BR />6 I call to remembrance my song, * and in the night I commune
with mine own heart, and search out my spirit.<BR />7 Will the Lord absent himself for ever? * and will he be no more
intreated?<BR />8 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? * and is his promise come
utterly to an end for evermore?<BR />9 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? * and will he shut up his
loving-kindness in displeasure?<BR />10 And I said, It is mine own infirmity; * but I will remember
the years of the right hand of the Most Highest.<BR />11 I will remember the works of the LORD, * and call to mind thy
wonders of old time.<BR />12 I will think also of all thy works, * and my talking shall
be of thy doings.<BR />13 Thy way, O God, is holy: * who is so great a God as our God?<BR />14 Thou art the God that doest wonders, * and hast declared thy
power among the peoples.<BR />15 Thou hast mightily delivered thy people, * even the sons of
Jacob and Joseph.<BR />16 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee, and were afraid;
* the depths also were troubled.<BR />17 The clouds poured out water, the air thundered, * and thine
arrows went abroad.<BR />18 The voice of thy thunder was heard round about: * the lightnings
shone upon the ground; the earth was moved, and shook withal.<BR />19 Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in the great waters, *
and thy footsteps are not known.<BR />20 Thou leddest thy people like sheep, * by the hand of Moses
and Aaron.<BR /></p><P><CENTER>Evening Prayer.</CENTER></p><P><B>Psalm 78. Attendite, popule.</B><BR />HEAR my law, O my people; * incline your ears unto the words of
my mouth.<BR />2 I will open my mouth in a parable; * I will declare hard sentences
of old;<BR />3 Which we have heard and known, * and such as our fathers have
told us;<BR />4 That we should not hide them from the children of the generations
to come; * but to show the honour of the LORD, his mighty and
wonderful works that he hath done.<BR />5 He made a covenant with Jacob, and gave Israel a law, * which
he commanded our forefathers to teach their children;<BR />6 That their posterity might know it, * and the children which
were yet unborn;<BR />7 To the intent that when they came up, * they might show their
children the same;<BR />8 That they might put their trust in God; * and not to forget
the works of God, but to keep his commandments;<BR />9 And not to be as their forefathers, a faithless and stubborn
generation; * a generation that set not their heart aright, and
whose spirit clave not stedfastly unto God;<BR />10 Like as the children of Ephraim; * who being harnessed, and
carrying bows, turned themselves back in the day of battle.<BR />11 They kept not the covenant of God, * and would not walk in
his law;<BR />12 But forgat what he had done, * and the wonderful works that
he had showed for them.<BR />13 Marvellous things did he in the sight of our forefathers, in
the land of Egypt, * even in the field of Zoan.<BR />14 He divided the sea, and let them go through; * he made the
waters to stand on an heap.<BR />15 In the day-time also he led them with a cloud, * and all the
night through with a light of fire.<BR />16 He clave the hard rocks in the wilderness, * and gave them
drink thereof, as it had been out of the great depth.<BR />17 He brought waters out of the stony rock, * so that it gushed
out like the rivers.<BR />18 Yet for all this they sinned more against him, * and provoked
the Most Highest in the wilderness.<BR />19 They tempted God in their hearts, * and required meat for their
lust.<BR />20 They spake against God also, saying, * Shall God prepare a
table in the wilderness?<BR />21 He smote the stony rock indeed, that the water gushed out,
and the streams flowed withal; * but can he give bread also, or
provide flesh for his people?<BR />22 When the LORD heard this, he was wroth; * so the fire was kindled
in Jacob, and there came up heavy displeasure against Israel;<BR />23 Because they believed not in God, * and put not their trust
in his help.<BR />24 So he commanded the clouds above, * and opened the doors of
heaven.<BR />25 He rained down manna also upon them for to eat, * and gave
them food from heaven.<BR />26 So man did eat angels' food; * for he sent them meat enough.<BR />27 He caused the east-wind to blow under heaven; * and through
his power he brought in the southwest-wind.<BR />28 He rained flesh upon them as thick as dust, * and feathered
fowls like as the sand of the sea.<BR />29 He let it fall among their tents, * even round about their
habitation.<BR />30 So they did eat, and were well filled; for he gave them their
own desire: * they were not disappointed of their lust.<BR />31 But while the meat was yet in their mouths, the heavy wrath
of God came upon them, and slew the wealthiest of them; * yea,
and smote down the chosen men that were in Israel.<BR />32 But for all this they sinned yet more, * and believed not his
wondrous works.<BR />33 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, * and their
years in trouble.<BR />34 When he slew them, they sought him, * and turned them early,
and inquired after God.<BR />35 And they remembered that God was their strength, * and that
the High God was their redeemer.<BR />36 Nevertheless, they did but flatter him with their mouth, *
and dissembled with him in their tongue.<BR />37 For their heart was not whole with him, * neither continued
they stedfast in his covenant.<BR />38 But he was so merciful, that he forgave their misdeeds, * and
destroyed them not.<BR />39 Yea, many a time turned he his wrath away, * and would not
suffer his whole displeasure to arise.<BR />40 For he considered that they were but flesh, * and that they
were even a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.<BR />41 Many a time did they provoke him in the wilderness, * and grieved
him in the desert.<BR />42 They turned back, and tempted God, * and provoked the Holy
One in Israel.<BR />43 They thought not of his hand, * and of the day when he delivered
them from the hand of the enemy;<BR />44 How he had wrought his miracles in Egypt, * and his wonders
in the field of Zoan.<BR />45 He turned their waters into blood, * so that they might not
drink of the rivers.<BR />46 He sent flies among them, and devoured them up; * and frogs
to destroy them.<BR />47 He gave their fruit unto the caterpillar, * and their labour
unto the grasshopper.<BR />48 He destroyed their vines with hailstones, * and their mulberry-trees
with the frost.<BR />49 He smote their cattle also with hailstones, * and their flocks
with hot thunderbolts.<BR />50 He cast upon them the furiousness of his wrath, anger, displeasure,
and trouble: * and sent evil angels among them.<BR />51 He made a way to his indignation, and spared not their soul
from death; * but gave their life over to the pestilence;<BR />52 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt, * the most principal
and mightiest in the dwellings of Ham.<BR />53 But as for his own people, he led them forth like sheep, *
and carried them in the wilderness like a flock.<BR />54 He brought them out safely, that they should not fear, * and
overwhelmed their enemies with the sea.<BR />55 And brought them within the borders of his sanctuary, * even
to this mountain, which he purchased with his right hand.<BR />56 He cast out the heathen also before them, * caused their land
to be divided among them for an heritage, and made the tribes
of Israel to dwell in their tents.<BR />57 Yet they tempted and displeased the Most High God, * and kept
not his testimonies.<BR />58 They turned their backs, and fell away like their forefathers;
* starting aside like a broken bow.<BR />59 For they grieved him with their hill-altars, * and provoked
him to displeasure with their images.<BR />60 When God heard this, he was wroth, * and took sore displeasure
at Israel;<BR />61 So that he forsook the tabernacle in Shiloh, * even the tent
that he had pitched among men.<BR />62 He delivered their power into captivity, * and their beauty
into the enemy's hand<BR />63 He gave his people over also unto the sword, * and was wroth
with his inheritance.<BR />64 The fire consumed their young men, * and their maidens were
not given in marriage.<BR />65 Their priests were slain with the sword, * and there were no
widows to make lamentation.<BR />66 So the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, * and like a giant
refreshed with wine.<BR />67 He drave his enemies backward, * and put them to a perpetual
shame.<BR />68 He refused the tabernacle of Joseph, * and chose not the tribe
of Ephraim;<BR />69 But chose the tribe of Judah, * even the hill of Sion which
he loved.<BR />70 And there he built his temple on high, * and laid the foundation
of it like the ground which he hath made continually.<BR />71 He chose David also his servant, * and took him away from the
sheep-folds:<BR />72 As he was following the ewes with their young he took him,
* that he might feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.<BR />73 So he fed them with a faithful and true heart, * and ruled
them prudently with all his power.<BR /></p><P><CENTER>The Sixteenth Day.<BR /><BR />Morning Prayer.</CENTER></p><P><B>Psalm 79. Deus, venerunt.</B><BR />O GOD, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; * thy holy
temple have they defiled, and made Jerusalem an heap of stones.<BR />2 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto
the fowls of the air, * and the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts
of the land.<BR />3 Their blood have they shed like water on every side of Jerusalem,
* and there was no man to bury them.<BR />4 We are become an open shame to our enemies, * a very scorn and
derision unto them that are round about us.<BR />5 LORD, how long wilt thou be angry? * shall thy jealousy burn
like fire for ever?<BR />6 Pour out thine indignation upon the heathen that have not known
thee; * and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy Name.<BR />7 For they have devoured Jacob, * and laid waste his dwelling-place.<BR />8 O remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and that
soon; * for we are come to great misery.<BR />9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name:
* O deliver us, and be merciful unto our sins, for thy Name's
sake.<BR />10 Wherefore do the heathen say, * Where is now their God?<BR />11 O let the vengeance of thy servants' blood that is shed, *
be openly showed upon the heathen, in our sight.<BR />12 O let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before thee;
* according to the greatness of thy power, preserve thou those
that are appointed to die.<BR />13 And for the blasphemy wherewith our neighbours have blasphemed
thee, * reward thou them, O Lord, sevenfold into their bosom.<BR />14 So we, that are thy people, and sheep of thy pasture, shall
give thee thanks for ever, * and will alway be showing forth thy
praise from generation to generation.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 80. Qui regis Israel.</B><BR />HEAR, O thou Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like
a flock; * show thyself also, thou that sittest upon the Cherubim.<BR />2 Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, * stir up thy strength,
and come and help us.<BR />3 Turn us again, O God; * show the light of thy countenance, and
we shall be whole.<BR />4 O LORD God of hosts, * how long wilt thou be angry with thy
people that prayeth?<BR />5 Thou feedest them with the bread of tears, * and givest them
plenteousness of tears to drink.<BR />6 Thou hast made us a very strife unto our neighbours, * and our
enemies laugh us to scorn.<BR />7 Turn us again, thou God of hosts; * show the light of thy countenance,
and we shall be whole.<BR />8 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt; * thou hast cast out
the heathen, and planted it.<BR />9 Thou madest room for it; * and when it had taken root, it filled
the land.<BR />10 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, * and the boughs
thereof were like the goodly cedar-trees.<BR />11 She stretched out her branches unto the sea, * and her boughs
unto the River.<BR />12 Why hast thou then broken down her hedge, * that all they that
go by pluck off her grapes?<BR />13 The wild boar out of the wood doth root it up, * and the wild
beasts of the field devour it.<BR />14 Turn thee again, thou God of hosts, look down from heaven,
* behold, and visit this vine;<BR />15 And the place of the vineyard that thy right hand hath planted,
* and the branch that thou madest so strong for thyself.<BR />16 It is burnt with fire, and cut down; * and they shall perish
at the rebuke of thy countenance.<BR />17 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, * and upon
the son of man, whom thou madest so strong for thine own self.<BR />18 And so will not we go back from thee: * O let us live, and
we shall call upon thy Name.<BR />19 Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts; * show the light of thy
countenance, and we shall be whole.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 81. Exultate Deo.</B><BR />SING we merrily unto God our strength; * make a cheerful noise
unto the God of Jacob.<BR />2 Take the psalm, bring hither the tabret, * the merry harp with
the lute.<BR />3 Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, * even in the time appointed,
and upon our solemn feast-day.<BR />4 For this was made a statute for Israel, * and a law of the God
of Jacob.<BR />5 This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, * when he came out
of the land of Egypt, and had heard a strange language.<BR />6 I eased his shoulder from the burden, * and his hands were delivered
from making the pots.<BR />7 Thou calledst upon me in troubles, and I delivered thee; * and
heard thee what time as the storm fell upon thee.<BR />8 I proved thee also * at the waters of strife.<BR />9 Hear, O my people; and I will assure thee, O Israel, * if thou
wilt hearken unto me,<BR />10 There shall no strange god be in thee, * neither shalt thou
worship any other god.<BR />11 I am the LORD thy God, who brought thee out of the land of
Egypt: * open thy mouth wide, and I shall fill it.<BR />12 But my people would not hear my voice; * and Israel would not
obey me;<BR />13 So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lusts, * and let them
follow their own imaginations.<BR />14 O that my people would have hearkened unto me! * for if Israel
had walked in my ways,<BR />15 I should soon have put down their enemies, * and turned my
hand against their adversaries.<BR />16 The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto
him; * but their time should have endured for ever.<BR />17 I would have fed them also with the finest wheatflour; * and
with honey out of the stony rock would I have satisfied thee.<BR /></p><P><CENTER>Evening Prayer.</CENTER></p><P><B>Psalm 82. Deus stetit.</B><BR />GOD standeth in the congregation of princes; * he is a Judge among

unto Jabin at the brook of Kishon;<BR />10 Who perished at Endor, * and became as the dung of the earth.<BR />11 Make them and their princes like Oreb and Zeeb; * yea, make
all their princes like as Zebah and Zalmunna;<BR />12 Who say, Let us take to ourselves * the houses of God in possession.<BR />13 O my God, make them like unto the whirling dust, * and as the
stubble before the wind;<BR />14 Like as the fire that burneth up the forest, * and as the flame
that consumeth the mountains;<BR />15 Pursue them even so with thy tempest, * and make them afraid
with thy storm.<BR />16 Make their faces ashamed, O LORD, * that they may seek thy
Name.<BR />17 Let them be confounded and vexed ever more and more; * let
them be put to shame, and perish.<BR />18 And they shall know that thou, whose Name is JEHOVAH, * art
only the Most Highest over all the earth.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 84. Quam dilecta!</B><BR />O HOW amiable are thy dwellings, * thou LORD of hosts!<BR />2 My soul hath a desire and longing to enter into the courts of

my soul from the nethermost hell.<BR />14 O God, the proud are risen against me; * and the congregations
of violent men have sought after my soul, and have not set thee
before their eyes.<BR />15 But thou, O Lord God, art full of compassion and mercy, * long-suffering,
plenteous in goodness and truth.<BR />16 O turn thee then unto me, and have mercy upon me; * give thy
strength unto thy servant, and help the son of thine handmaid.<BR />17 Show some token upon me for good; that they who hate me may
see it, and be ashamed, * because thou, LORD, hast holpen me,
and comforted me.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 87. Fundamenta ejus.</B><BR />HER foundations are upon the holy hills: * the LORD loveth the
gates of Sion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.<BR />2 Very excellent things are spoken of thee, * thou city of God.<BR />3 I will make mention of Egypt and Babylon, * among them that
know me.<BR />4 Behold, Philistia also; and Tyre, with Ethiopia; * lo, in Sion
were they born.<BR />5 Yea, of Sion it shall be reported, this one and that one were
born in her; * and the Most High shall stablish her.<BR />6 The LORD shall record it, when he writeth up the peoples; *
lo, in Sion were they born.<BR />7 The singers also and trumpeters shall make answer: * All my
fresh springs are in thee.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 88. Domine, Deus.</B><BR />O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before
thee: * O let my prayer enter into thy presence, incline thine
ear unto my calling;<BR />2 For my soul is full of trouble, * and my life draweth nigh unto
the grave.<BR />3 I am counted as one of them that go down into the pit, * and
I am even as a man that hath no strength;<BR />4 Cast off among the dead, like unto them that are slain, and
lie in the grave, * who are out of remembrance, and are cut away
from thy hand.<BR />5 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, * in a place of darkness,
and in the deep.<BR />6 Thine indignation lieth hard upon me, * and thou hast vexed
me with all thy storms.<BR />7 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me, * and made
me to be abhorred of them.<BR />8 I am so fast in prison * that I cannot get forth.<BR />9 My sight faileth for very trouble; * LORD, I have called daily
upon thee, I have stretched forth my hands unto thee.<BR />10 Dost thou show wonders among the dead? * or shall the dead
rise up again, and praise thee?<BR />11 Shall thy loving-kindness be showed in the grave? * or thy
faithfulness in destruction?<BR />12 Shall thy wondrous works be known in the dark? * and thy righteousness
in the land where all things are forgotten?<BR />13 Unto thee have I cried, O LORD; * and early shall my prayer
come before thee.<BR />14 LORD, why abhorrest thou my soul, * and hidest thou thy face
from me?<BR />15 I am in misery, and like unto him that is at the point to die;
* even from my youth up, thy terrors have I suffered with a troubled
mind.<BR />16 Thy wrathful displeasure goeth over me, * and the fear of thee
hath undone me.<BR />17 They came round about me daily like water, * and compassed
me together on every side.<BR />18 My lovers and friends hast thou put away from me, * and hid
mine acquaintance out of my sight.<BR /></p><P><CENTER>Evening Prayer.</CENTER></p><P><B>Psalm 89. Misericordias Domini</B>.<BR />MY song shall be alway of the loving-kindness of the LORD; * with
my mouth will I ever be showing thy truth from one generation
to another.<BR />2 For I have said, Mercy shall be set up for ever; * thy truth
shalt thou stablish in the heavens.<BR />3 I have made a covenant with my chosen; * I have sworn unto David
my servant:<BR />4 Thy seed will I stablish for ever, * and set up thy throne from
one generation to another.<BR />5 O LORD, the very heavens shall praise thy wondrous works; *
and thy truth in the congregation of the saints.<BR />6 For who is he among the clouds, * that shall be compared unto
the LORD?<BR />7 And what is he among the gods, * that shall be like unto the
LORD?<BR />8 God is very greatly to be feared in the council of the saints,
* and to be had in reverence of all them that are round about
him.<BR />9 O Lord God of hosts, who is like unto thee? * thy truth, most
mighty LORD, is on every side.<BR />10 Thou rulest the raging of the sea; * thou stillest the waves
thereof when they arise.<BR />11 Thou hast subdued Egypt, and destroyed it; * thou hast scattered
thine enemies abroad with thy mighty arm.<BR />12 The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine; * thou hast
laid the foundation of the round world, and all that therein is.<BR />13 Thou hast made the north and the south; * Tabor and Hermon
shall rejoice in thy Name.<BR />14 Thou hast a mighty arm; * strong is thy hand, and high is thy
right hand.<BR />15 Righteousness and equity are the habitation of thy seat; *
mercy and truth shall go before thy face.<BR />16 Blessed is the people, O LORD, that can rejoice in thee; *
they shall walk in the light of thy countenance.<BR />17 Their delight shall be daily in thy Name; * and in thy righteousness
shall they make their boast.<BR />18 For thou art the glory of their strength, * and in thy loving-kindness
thou shalt lift up our horns.<BR />19 For the LORD is our defence; * the Holy One of Israel is our
King.<BR />20 Thou spakest sometime in visions unto thy saints, and saidst,
* I have laid help upon one that is mighty, I have exalted one
chosen out of the people.<BR />21 I have found David my servant; * with my holy oil have I anointed
him.<BR />22 My hand shall hold him fast, * and my arm shall strengthen
him.<BR />23 The enemy shall not be able to do him violence; * the son of
wickedness shall not hurt him.<BR />24 I will smite down his foes before his face, * and plague them
that hate him.<BR />25 My truth also and my mercy shall be with him; * and in my Name
shall his horn be exalted.<BR />26 I will set his dominion also in the sea, * and his right hand
in the floods.<BR />27 He shall call me, Thou art my Father, * my God, and my strong
salvation.<BR />28 And I will make him my firstborn, * higher than the kings of
the earth.<BR />29 My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, * and my covenant
shall stand fast with him.<BR />30 His seed also will I make to endure for ever, * and his throne
as the days of heaven.<BR />31 But if his children forsake my law, * and walk not in my judgments;<BR />32 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; *
I will visit their offences with the rod, and their sin with scourges.<BR />33 Nevertheless, my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from
him, * nor suffer my truth to fail.<BR />34 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone
out of my lips: * I have sworn once by my holiness, that I will
not fail David.<BR />35 His seed shall endure for ever, * and his throne is like as
the sun before me.<BR />36 He shall stand fast for evermore as the moon, * and as the
faithful witness in heaven.<BR />37 But thou hast abhorred and forsaken thine anointed, * and art
displeased at him.<BR />38 Thou hast broken the covenant of thy servant, * and cast his
crown to the ground.<BR />39 Thou hast overthrown all his hedges, * and broken down his
strongholds.<BR />40 All they that go by spoil him, * and he is become a reproach
to his neighbours.<BR />41 Thou hast set up the right hand of his enemies, * and made
all his adversaries to rejoice.<BR />42 Thou hast taken away the edge of his sword, * and givest him
not victory in the battle.<BR />43 Thou hast put out his glory, * and cast his throne down to
the ground.<BR />44 The days of his youth hast thou shortened, * and covered him
with dishonour.<BR />45 LORD, how long wilt thou hide thyself? for ever? * and shall
thy wrath burn like fire?<BR />46 O remember how short my time is; * wherefore hast thou made
all men for nought?<BR />47 What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? * and
shall he deliver his soul from the power of the grave?<BR />48 Lord, where are thy old loving-kindnesses, * which thou swarest
unto David in thy truth?<BR />49 Remember, Lord, the rebuke that thy servants have, * and how
I do bear in my bosom the rebukes of many people;<BR />50 Wherewith thine enemies have blasphemed thee, * and slandered
the footsteps of thine anointed.<BR />51 Praised be the LORD for evermore. * Amen, and Amen.<BR /></P><H5><CENTER>Go to <A HREF="../index.html">1928 Book of Common
