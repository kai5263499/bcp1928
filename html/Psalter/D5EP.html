    <p><strong>Psalm 27. Dominus illuminatio.</strong><br />
      THE LORD is my light and my salvation; whom then shall I fear? * the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom then shall I be afraid?<br />
      2 When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, * they stumbled and fell.<br />
      3 Though an host of men were laid against me, yet shall not my heart be afraid; * and though there rose up war against me, yet will I put my trust in him.<br />
      4 One thing have I desired of the LORD, which I will require; * even that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the fair beauty of the LORD, and to visit his temple.<br />
      5 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his tabernacle; * yea, in the secret place of his dwelling shall he hide me, and set me up upon a rock of stone.<br />
      6 And now shall he lift up mine head * above mine enemies round about me.<br />
      7 Therefore will I offer in his dwelling an oblation, with great gladness: * I will sing and speak praises unto the LORD.<br />
      8 Hearken unto my voice, O LORD, when I cry unto thee; * have mercy upon me, and hear me.<br />
      9 My heart hath talked of thee, Seek ye my face: * Thy face, LORD, will I seek.<br />
      10 O hide not thou thy face from me, * nor cast thy servant away in displeasure.<br />
      11 Thou hast been my succour; * leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.<br />
      12 When my father and my mother forsake me, * the LORD taketh me up.<br />
      13 Teach me thy way, O LORD, * and lead me in the right way, because of mine enemies.<br />
      14 Deliver me not over into the will of mine adversaries: * for there are false witnesses risen up against me, and such as speak wrong.<br />
      15 I should utterly have fainted, * but that I believe verily to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.<br />
      16 O tarry thou the LORD'S leisure; * be strong, and he shall comfort thine heart; and put thou thy trust in the LORD.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 28. Ad te, Domine.</strong><br />
      UNTO thee will I cry, O LORD, my strength: * think no scorn of me; lest, if thou make as though thou hearest not, I become like them that go down into the pit.<br />
      2 Hear the voice of my humble petitions, when I cry unto thee; * when I hold up my hands towards the mercyseat of thy holy temple.<br />
      3 O pluck me not away, neither destroy me with the ungodly and wicked doers, * which speak friendly to their neighbours, but imagine mischief in their hearts.<br />
      4 Reward them according to their deeds, * and according to the wickedness of their own inventions.<br />
      5 Recompense them after the work of their hands; * pay them that they have deserved.<br />
      6 For they regard not in their mind the works of the LORD, nor the operation of his hands; * therefore shall he break them down, and not build them up.<br />
      7 Praised be the LORD; * for he hath heard the voice of my humble petitions.<br />
      8 The LORD is my strength, and my shield; my heart hath trusted in him, and I am helped; * therefore my heart danceth for joy, and in my song will I praise him.<br />
      9 The LORD is my strength, * and he is the wholesome defence of his anointed.<br />
      10 O save thy people, and give thy blessing unto thine inheritance: * feed them, and set them up for ever.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 29. Afferte Domino.</strong><br />
      A SCRIBE unto the LORD, O ye mighty, * ascribe unto the LORD worship and strength.<br />
      2 Ascribe unto the LORD the honour due unto his Name; * worship the LORD with holy worship.<br />
      3 The voice of the LORD is upon the waters; * it is the glorious God that maketh the thunder.<br />
      4 It is the LORD that ruleth the sea; the voice of the LORD is mighty in operation; * the voice of the LORD is a glorious voice.<br />
      5 The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedar-trees; * yea, the LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.<br />
      6 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; * Lebanon also, and Sirion, like a young unicorn.<br />
      7 The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire; the voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; * yea, the LORD shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.<br />
      8 The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to bring forth young, and strippeth bare the forests: * in his temple doth every thing speak of his honour.<br />
      9 The LORD sitteth above the water-flood, * and the LORD remaineth a King for ever.<br />
    10 The LORD shall give strength unto his people; * the LORD shall give his people the blessing of peace.
