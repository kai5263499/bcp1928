      The Twenty-first Day.<BR>
<BR>
      Morning Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 105. Confitemini Domino.</B><BR>
      GIVE thanks unto the LORD, and call upon his Name; * tell the
      people what things he hath done.<BR>
      2 O let your songs be of him, and praise him; * and let your
      talking be of all his wondrous works.<BR>
      3 Rejoice in his holy Name; * let the heart of them rejoice that
      seek the LORD.<BR>
      4 Seek the LORD and his strength; * seek his face evermore.<BR>
      5 Remember the marvellous works that he hath done; * his wonders,
      and the judgments of his mouth;<BR>
      6 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, * ye children of Jacob his
      chosen.<BR>
      7 He is the LORD our God; * his judgments are in all the world.<BR>
      8 He hath been alway mindful of his covenant and promise, * that
      he made to a thousand generations;<BR>
      9 Even the covenant that he made with Abraham; * and the oath
      that he sware unto Isaac;<BR>
      10 And appointed the same unto Jacob for a law, * and to Israel
      for an everlasting testament;<BR>
      11 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, * the lot
      of your inheritance:<BR>
      12 When there were yet but a few of them, * and they strangers
      in the land;<BR>
      13 What time as they went from one nation to another, * from
      one kingdom to another people;<BR>
      14 He suffered no man to do them wrong, * but reproved even kings
      for their sakes;<BR>
      15 Touch not mine anointed, * and do my prophets no harm.<BR>
      16 Moreover, he called for a dearth upon the land, * and destroyed
      all the provision of bread.<BR>
      17 But he had sent a man before them, * even Joseph, who was
      sold to be a bond-servant;<BR>
      18 Whose feet they hurt in the stocks; * the iron entered into
      his soul;<BR>
      19 Until the time came that his cause was known: * the word of
      the LORD tried him.<BR>
      20 The king sent, and delivered him; * the prince of the people
      let him go free.<BR>
      21 He made him lord also of his house, * and ruler of all his
      substance;<BR>
      22 That he might inform his princes after his will, * and teach
      his senators wisdom.<BR>
      23 Israel also came into Egypt, * and Jacob was a stranger in
      the land of Ham.<BR>
      24 And he increased his people exceedingly, * and made them stronger
      than their enemies;<BR>
      25 Whose heart turned so, that they hated his people, * and dealt
      untruly with his servants.<BR>
      26 Then sent he Moses his servant, * and Aaron whom he had chosen.<BR>
      27 And these showed his tokens among them, * and wonders in the
      land of Ham.<BR>
      28 He sent darkness, and it was dark; * and they were not obedient
      unto his word.<BR>
      29 He turned their waters into blood, * and slew their fish.<BR>
      30 Their land brought forth frogs; * yea, even in their kings'
      chambers.<BR>
      31 He spake the word, and there came all manner of flies, * and
      lice in all their quarters.<BR>
      32 He gave them hailstones for rain; * and flames of fire in
      their land.<BR>
      33 He smote their vines also and fig-trees; * and destroyed the
      trees that were in their coasts.<BR>
      34 He spake the word, and the grasshoppers came, and caterpillars
      innumerable, * and did eat up all the grass in their land, and
      devoured the fruit of their ground.<BR>
      35 He smote all the firstborn in their land; * even the chief
      of all their strength.<BR>
      36 He brought them forth also with silver and gold; * there was
      not one feeble person among their tribes.<BR>
      37 Egypt was glad at their departing; * for they were afraid
      of them.<BR>
      38 He spread out a cloud to be a covering, * and fire to give
      light in the night season.<BR>
      39 At their desire he brought quails; * and he filled them with
      the bread of heaven.<BR>
      40 He opened the rock of stone, and the waters flowed out, *
      so that rivers ran in the dry places.<BR>
      41 For why? he remembered his holy promise; * and Abraham his
      servant.<BR>
      42 And he brought forth his people with joy, * and his chosen
      with gladness;<BR>
      43 And gave them the lands of the heathen; * and they took the
      labours of the people in possession;<BR>
      44 That they might keep his statutes, * and observe his laws.<BR>

      <P><CENTER><A NAME="anchor461909"></A>Evening Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 106. Confitemini Domino.</B><BR>
      O GIVE thanks unto the LORD; for he is gracious, * and his mercy
      endureth for ever.<BR>
      2 Who can express the noble acts of the LORD, * or show forth
      all his praise?<BR>
      3 Blessed are they that alway keep judgment, * and do righteousness.<BR>
      4 Remember me, O LORD, according to the favour that thou bearest
      unto thy people; * O visit me with thy salvation;<BR>
      5 That I may see the felicity of thy chosen, * and rejoice in
      the gladness of thy people, and give thanks with thine inheritance.<BR>
      6 We have sinned with our fathers; * we have done amiss, and
      dealt wickedly.<BR>
      7 Our fathers regarded not thy wonders in Egypt, neither kept
      they thy great goodness in remembrance; * but were disobedient
      at the sea, even at the Red Sea.<BR>
      8 Nevertheless, he helped them for his Name's sake, * that he
      might make his power to be known.<BR>
      9 He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up; * so he led
      them through the deep, as through a wilderness.<BR>
      10 And he saved them from the adversary's hand, * and delivered
      them from the hand of the enemy.<BR>
      11 As for those that troubled them, the waters overwhelmed them;
      * there was not one of them left.<BR>
      12 Then believed they his words, * and sang praise unto him.<BR>
      13 But within a while they forgat his works, * and would not
      abide his counsel.<BR>
      14 But lust came upon them in the wilderness, * and they tempted
      God in the desert.<BR>
      15 And he gave them their desire, * and sent leanness withal
      into their soul.<BR>
      16 They angered Moses also in the tents, * and Aaron the saint
      of the LORD.<BR>
      17 So the earth opened, and swallowed up Dathan, * and covered
      the congregation of Abiram.<BR>
      18 And the fire was kindled in their company; * the flame burnt
      up the ungodly.<BR>
      19 They made a calf in Horeb, * and worshipped the molten image.<BR>
      20 Thus they turned their glory * into the similitude of a calf
      that eateth hay.<BR>
      21 And they forgat God their Saviour, * who had done so great
      things in Egypt;<BR>
      22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham; * and fearful things by
      the Red Sea.<BR>
      23 So he said he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his
      chosen stood before him in the gap, * to turn away his wrathful
      indignation, lest he should destroy them.<BR>
      24 Yea, they thought scorn of that pleasant land, * and gave
      no credence unto his word;<BR>
      25 But murmured in their tents, * and hearkened not unto the
      voice of the LORD.<BR>
      26 Then lift he up his hand against them, * to overthrow them
      in the wilderness;<BR>
      27 To cast out their seed among the nations, * and to scatter
      them in the lands.<BR>
      28 They joined themselves unto Baal-peor, * and ate the offerings
      of the dead.<BR>
      29 Thus they provoked him to anger with their own inventions;
      * and the plague was great among them.<BR>
      30 Then stood up Phinehas, and interposed; * and so the plague
      ceased.<BR>
      31 And that was counted unto him for righteousness, * among all
      posterities for evermore.<BR>
      32 They angered him also at the waters of strife, * so that he
      punished Moses for their sakes;<BR>
      33 Because they provoked his spirit, * so that he spake unadvisedly
      with his lips.<BR>
      34 Neither destroyed they the heathen, * as the LORD commanded
      them;<BR>
      35 But were mingled among the heathen, * and learned their works.<BR>
      36 Insomuch that they worshipped their idols, which became a
      snare unto them; * yea, they offered their sons and their daughters
      unto devils;<BR>
      37 And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and
      of their daughters, * whom they offered unto the idols of Canaan;
      and the land was defiled with blood.<BR>
      38 Thus were they stained with their own works, * and went a
      whoring with their own inventions.<BR>
      39 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people,
      * insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.<BR>
      40 And he gave them over into the hand of the heathen; * and
      they that hated them were lords over them.<BR>
      41 Their enemies oppressed them, * and had them in subjection.<BR>
      42 Many a time did he deliver them; * but they rebelled against
      him with their own inventions, and were brought down in their
      wickedness.<BR>
      43 Nevertheless, when he saw their adversity, * he heard their
      complaint.<BR>
      44 He thought upon his covenant, and pitied them, according unto
      the multitude of his mercies; * yea, he made all those that led
      them away captive to pity them.<BR>
      45 Deliver us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen;
      * that we may give thanks unto thy holy Name, and make our boast
      of thy praise.<BR>
      46 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, from everlasting, and world
      without end; * And let all the people say, Amen.<BR>
