      <P><B>Psalms 41. Beatus qui intelligit.</B><BR>
      BLESSED is he that considereth the poor and needy; * the LORD
      shall deliver him in the time of trouble.<BR>
      2 The LORD preserve him, and keep him alive, that he may be blessed
      upon earth; * and deliver not thou him into the will of his enemies.<BR>
      3 The LORD comfort him when he lieth sick upon his bed; * make
      thou all his bed in his sickness.<BR>
      4 I said, LORD, be merciful unto me; * heal my soul, for I have
      sinned against thee.<BR>
      5 Mine enemies speak evil of me, * When shall he die, and his
      name perish?<BR>
      6 And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity, * and his heart
      conceiveth falsehood within himself; and when he cometh forth,
      he telleth it.<BR>
      7 All mine enemies whisper together against me; * even against
      me do they imagine this evil.<BR>
      8 An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him; * and now
      that he lieth, he shall rise up no more.<BR>
      9 Yea, even mine own familiar friend whom I trusted, * who did
      also eat of my bread, hath laid great wait for me.<BR>
      10 But be thou merciful unto me, O LORD; * raise thou me up again,
      and I shall reward them.<BR>
      11 By this I know thou favourest me, * that mine enemy doth not
      triumph against me.<BR>
      12 And in my innocency thou upholdest me, * and shalt set me
      before thy face for ever.<BR>
      13 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, * world without end. Amen.
