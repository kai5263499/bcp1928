      <P><B>Psalm 76. Notus in Judaea.</B><BR>
      IN Judah is God known; * his Name is great in Israel.<BR>
      2 At Salem is his tabernacle, * and his dwelling in Sion.<BR>
      3 There brake he the arrows of the bow, * the shield, the sword,
      and the battle.<BR>
      4 Thou art glorious in might, * when thou comest from the hills
      of the robbers.<BR>
      5 The proud are robbed, they have slept their sleep; * and all
      the men whose hands were mighty have found nothing.<BR>
      6 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, * both the chariot and horse
      are fallen.<BR>
      7 Thou, even thou art to be feared; * and who may stand in thy
      sight when thou art angry?<BR>
      8 Thou didst cause thy judgment to be heard from heaven; * the
      earth trembled, and was still,<BR>
      9 When God arose to judgment, * and to help all the meek upon
      earth.<BR>
      10 The fierceness of man shall turn to thy praise; * and the
      fierceness of them shalt thou refrain.<BR>
      11 Promise unto the LORD your God, and keep it, all ye that are
      round about him; * bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.<BR>
      12 He shall refrain the spirit of princes, * and is wonderful
      among the kings of the earth.
