      <P><B>Psalms 19. Caeli enarrant.</B><BR>
      THE heavens declare the glory of God; * and the firmament showeth
      his handy-work.<BR>
      2 One day telleth another; * and one night certifieth another.<BR>
      3 There is neither speech nor language; * but their voices are
      heard among them.<BR>
      4 Their sound is gone out into all lands; * and their words into
      the ends of the world.<BR>
      5 In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun; * which cometh
      forth as a bridegroom out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a
      giant to run his course.<BR>
      6 It goeth forth from the uttermost part of the heaven, and runneth
      about unto the end of it again; * and there is nothing hid from
      the heat thereof.<BR>
      7 The law of the LORD is an undefiled law, converting the soul;
      * the testimony of the LORD is sure, and giveth wisdom unto the
      simple.<BR>
      8 The statutes of the LORD are right, and rejoice the heart;
      * the commandment of the LORD is pure, and giveth light unto
      the eyes.<BR>
      9 The fear of the LORD is clean, and endureth for ever; * the
      judgments of the LORD are true, and righteous altogether.<BR>
      10 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine
      gold; * sweeter also than honey, and the honeycomb.<BR>
      11 Moreover, by them is thy servant taught; * and in keeping
      of them there is great reward.<BR>
      12 Who can tell how oft he offendeth? * O cleanse thou me from
      my secret faults.<BR>
      13 Keep thy servant also from presumptuous sins, lest they get
      the dominion over me; * so shall I be undefiled, and innocent
      from the great offence.<BR>
      14 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart,
      be alway acceptable in thy sight, * O LORD, my strength and my
      redeemer.
