      The Twentieth Day.<BR>
<BR>
      Morning Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 102. Domine, exaudi.</B><BR>
      HEAR my prayer, O LORD, * and let my crying come unto thee.<BR>
      2 Hide not thy face from me in the time of my trouble; * incline
      thine ear unto me when I call; O hear me, and that right soon.<BR>
      3 For my days are consumed away like smoke, * and my bones are
      burnt up as it were a firebrand.<BR>
      4 My heart is smitten down, and withered like grass; * so that
      I forget to eat my bread.<BR>
      5 For the voice of my groaning, * my bones will scarce cleave
      to my flesh.<BR>
      6 I am become like a pelican in the wilderness, * and like an
      owl that is in the desert.<BR>
      7 I have watched, and am even as it were a sparrow, * that sitteth
      alone upon the housetop.<BR>
      8 Mine enemies revile me all the day long; * and they that are
      mad upon me are sworn together against me.<BR>
      9 For I have eaten ashes as it were bread, * and mingled my drink
      with weeping;<BR>
      10 And that, because of thine indignation and wrath; * for thou
      hast taken me up, and cast me down.<BR>
      11 My days are gone like a shadow, * and I am withered like grass.<BR>
      12 But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever, * and thy remembrance
      throughout all generations.<BR>
      13 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Sion; * for it is time
      that thou have mercy upon her, yea, the time is come.<BR>
      14 And why? thy servants think upon her stones, * and it pitieth
      them to see her in the dust.<BR>
      15 The nations shall fear thy Name, O LORD; * and all the kings
      of the earth thy majesty;<BR>
      16 When the LORD shall build up Sion, * and when his glory shall
      appear;<BR>
      17 When he turneth him unto the prayer of the poor destitute,
      * and despiseth not their desire.<BR>
      18 This shall be written for those that come after, * and the
      people which shall be born shall praise the LORD.<BR>
      19 For he hath looked down from his sanctuary; * out of the heaven
      did the LORD behold the earth;<BR>
      20 That he might hear the mournings of such as are in captivity,
      * and deliver them that are appointed unto death;<BR>
      21 That they may declare the Name of the LORD in Sion, * and
      his worship at Jerusalem;<BR>
      22 When the peoples are gathered together, * and the kingdoms
      also, to serve the LORD.<BR>
      23 He brought down my strength in my journey, * and shortened
      my days.<BR>
      24 But I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of mine
      age; * as for thy years, they endure throughout all generations.<BR>
      25 Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the
      earth, * and the heavens are the work of thy hands.<BR>
      26 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: * they all shall
      wax old as doth a garment;<BR>
      27 And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be
      changed; * but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.<BR>
      28 The children of thy servants shall continue, * and their seed
      shall stand fast in thy sight.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 103. Benedic, anima mea.</B><BR>
      PRAISE the LORD, O my soul; * and all that is within me, praise
      his holy Name.<BR>
      2 Praise the LORD, O my soul, * and forget not all his benefits:<BR>
      3 Who forgiveth all thy sin, * and healeth all thine infirmities;<BR>
      4 Who saveth thy life from destruction, * and crowneth thee with
      mercy and loving-kindness;<BR>
      5 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things, * making thee young
      and lusty as an eagle.<BR>
      6 The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment * for all them
      that are oppressed with wrong.<BR>
      7 He showed his ways unto Moses, * his works unto the children
      of Israel.<BR>
      8 The LORD is full of compassion and mercy, * longsuffering,
      and of great goodness.<BR>
      9 He will not alway be chiding; * neither keepeth he his anger
      for ever.<BR>
      10 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; * nor rewarded us
      according to our wickednesses.<BR>
      11 For look how high the heaven is in comparison of the earth;
      * so great is his mercy also toward them that fear him.<BR>
      12 Look how wide also the east is from the west; * so far hath
      he set our sins from us.<BR>
      13 Yea, like as a father pitieth his own children; * even so
      is the LORD merciful unto them that fear him.<BR>
      14 For he knoweth whereof we are made; * he remembereth that
      we are but dust.<BR>
      15 The days of man are but as grass; * for he flourisheth as
      a flower of the field.<BR>
      16 For as soon as the wind goeth over it, it is gone; * and the
      place thereof shall know it no more.<BR>
      17 But the merciful goodness of the LORD endureth for ever and
      ever upon them that fear him; * and his righteousness upon children's
      children;<BR>
      18 Even upon such as keep his covenant, * and think upon his
      commandments to do them.<BR>
      19 The LORD hath prepared his seat in heaven, * and his kingdom
      ruleth over all.<BR>
      20 O praise the LORD, ye angels of his, ye that excel in strength;
      * ye that fulfil his commandment, and hearken unto the voice
      of his word.<BR>
      21 O praise the LORD, all ye his hosts; * ye servants of his
      that do his pleasure.<BR>
      22 O speak good of the LORD, all ye works of his, in all places
      of his dominion: * praise thou the LORD, O my soul.<BR>

      <P><CENTER><A NAME="anchor457770"></A>Evening Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 104. Benedic, anima mea.</B><BR>
      PRAISE the LORD, O my soul: * O LORD my God, thou art become
      exceeding glorious; thou art clothed with majesty and honour.<BR>
      2 Thou deckest thyself with light as it were with a garment,
      * and spreadest out the heavens like a curtain.<BR>
      3 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters, * and maketh
      the clouds his chariot, and walketh upon the wings of the wind.<BR>
      4 He maketh his angels winds, * and his ministers a flaming fire.<BR>
      5 He laid the foundations of the earth, * that it never should
      move at any time.<BR>
      6 Thou coveredst it with the deep like as with a garment; * the
      waters stand above the hills.<BR>
      7 At thy rebuke they flee; * at the voice of thy thunder they
      haste away.<BR>
      8 They go up as high as the hills, and down to the valleys beneath;
      * even unto the place which thou hast appointed for them.<BR>
      9 Thou hast set them their bounds, which they shall not pass,
      * neither turn again to cover the earth.<BR>
      10 He sendeth the springs into the rivers, * which run among
      the hills.<BR>
      11 All beasts of the field drink thereof, * and the wild asses
      quench their thirst.<BR>
      12 Beside them shall the fowls of the air have their habitation,
      * and sing among the branches.<BR>
      13 He watereth the hills from above; * the earth is filled with
      the fruit of thy works.<BR>
      14 He bringeth forth grass for the cattle, * and green herb for
      the service of men;<BR>
      15 That he may bring food out of the earth, and wine that maketh
      glad the heart of man; * and oil to make him a cheerful countenance,
      and bread to strengthen man's heart.<BR>
      16 The trees of the LORD also are full of sap; * even the cedars
      of Lebanon which he hath planted;<BR>
      17 Wherein the birds make their nests; * and the firtrees are
      a dwelling for the stork.<BR>
      18 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; * and so are
      the stony rocks for the conies.<BR>
      19 He appointed the moon for certain seasons, * and the sun knoweth
      his going down.<BR>
      20 Thou makest darkness that it may be night; * wherein all the
      beasts of the forest do move.<BR>
      21 The lions, roaring after their prey, * do seek their meat
      from God.<BR>
      22 The sun ariseth, and they get them away together, * and lay
      them down in their dens.<BR>
      23 Man goeth forth to his work, and to his labour, * until the
      evening.<BR>
      24 O LORD, how manifold are thy works! * in wisdom hast thou
      made them all; the earth is full of thy riches.<BR>
      25 So is the great and wide sea also; * wherein are things creeping
      innumerable, both small and great beasts.<BR>
      26 There go the ships, and there is that leviathan, * whom thou
      hast made to take his pastime therein.<BR>
      27 These wait all upon thee, * that thou mayest give them meat
      in due season.<BR>
      28 When thou givest it them, they gather it; * and when thou
      openest thy hand, they are filled with good.<BR>
      29 When thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: * when thou
      takest away their breath, they die, and are turned again to their
      dust.<BR>
      30 When thou lettest thy breath go forth, they shall be made;
      * and thou shalt renew the face of the earth.<BR>
      31 The glorious majesty of the LORD shall endure for ever; *
      the LORD shall rejoice in his works.<BR>
      32 The earth shall tremble at the look of him; * if he do but
      touch the hills, they shall smoke.<BR>
      33 I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live; * I will praise
      my God while I have my being.<BR>
      34 And so shall my words please him: * my joy shall be in the
      LORD.<BR>
      35 As for sinners, they shall be consumed out of the earth, *
      and the ungodly shall come to an end.<BR>
      36 Praise thou the LORD, O my soul. * Praise the LORD.<BR>
