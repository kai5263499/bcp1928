    <p><strong>Evening Prayer.<br />
      Psalm 32. Beati quorum.</strong><br />
      BLESSED is he whose unrighteousness is forgiven, * and whose sin is covered.<br />
      2 Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth no sin, * and in whose spirit there is no guile.<br />
      3 For whilst I held my tongue, * my bones consumed away through my daily complaining.<br />
      4 For thy hand was heavy upon me day and night, * and my moisture was like the drought in summer.<br />
      5 I acknowledged my sin unto thee; * and mine unrighteousness have I not hid.<br />
      6 I said, I will confess my sins unto the LORD; * and SO thou forgavest the wickedness of my sin.<br />
      7 For this shall every one that is godly make his prayer unto thee, in a time when thou mayest be found; * surely the great water-floods shall not come nigh him.<br />
      8 Thou art a place to hide me in; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; * thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance.<br />
      9 I will inform thee, and teach thee in the way wherein thou shalt go; * and I will guide thee with mine eye.<br />
      10 Be ye not like to horse and mule, which have no understanding; * whose mouths must be held with bit and bridle, else they will not obey thee.<br />
      11 Great plagues remain for the ungodly; * but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD, mercy embraceth him on every side.<br />
      12 Be glad, O ye righteous, and rejoice in the LORD; * and be joyful, all ye that are true of heart.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 33. Exultate, justi.</strong><br />
      REJOICE in the LORD, O ye righteous; * for it becometh well the just to be thankful.<br />
      2 Praise the LORD with harp; * sing praises unto him with the lute, and instrument of ten strings.<br />
      3 Sing unto the Lord a new song; * sing praises lustily unto him with a good courage.<br />
      4 For the word of the LORD is true; * and all his works are faithful.<br />
      5 He loveth righteousness and judgment; * the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD.<br />
      6 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; * and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.<br />
      7 He gathereth the waters of the sea together, as it were upon an heap; * and layeth up the deep, as in a treasure-house.<br />
      8 Let all the earth fear the LORD: * stand in awe of him, all ye that dwell in the world.<br />
      9 For he spake, and it was done; * he commanded, and it stood fast.<br />
      10 The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought, * and maketh the devices of the people to be of none effect, and casteth out the counsels of princes.<br />
      11 The counsel of the LORD shall endure for ever, * and the thoughts of his heart from generation to generation.<br />
      12 Blessed are the people whose God is the Lord JEHOVAH; * and blessed are the folk that he hath chosen to him, to be his inheritance.<br />
      13 The LORD looketh down from heaven, and beholdeth all the children of men; * from the habitation of his dwelling, he considereth all them that dwell on the earth.<br />
      14 He fashioneth all the hearts of them, * and understandeth all their works.<br />
      15 There is no king that can be saved by the multitude of an host; * neither is any mighty man delivered by much strength.<br />
      16 A horse is counted but a vain thing to save a man; * neither shall he deliver any man by his great strength.<br />
      17 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, * and upon them that put their trust in his mercy;<br />
      18 To deliver their soul from death, * and to feed them in the time of dearth.<br />
      19 Our soul hath patiently tarried for the LORD; * for he is our help and our shield.<br />
      20 For our heart shall rejoice in him; * because we have hoped in his holy Name.<br />
      21 Let thy merciful kindness, O LORD, be upon us, * like as we do put our trust in thee.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 34. Benedicam Dominum.</strong><br />
      I WILL alway give thanks unto the LORD; * his praise shall ever be in my mouth.<br />
      2 My soul shall make her boast in the LORD; * the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad.<br />
      3 O praise the LORD with me, * and let us magnify his Name together.<br />
      4 I sought the LORD, and he heard me; * yea, he delivered me out of all my fear.<br />
      5 They had an eye unto him, and were lightened; * and their faces were not ashamed.<br />
      6 Lo, the poor crieth, and the LORD heareth him; * yea, and saveth him out of all his troubles.<br />
      7 The angel of the LORD tarrieth round about them that fear him, * and delivereth them.<br />
      8 O taste, and see, how gracious the LORD is: * blessed is the man that trusteth in him.<br />
      9 O fear the LORD, ye that are his saints; * for they that fear him lack nothing.<br />
      10 The lions do lack, and suffer hunger; * but they who seek the LORD shall want no manner of thing that is good.<br />
      11 Come, ye children, and hearken unto me; * I will teach you the fear of the LORD.<br />
      12 What man is he that lusteth to live, * and would fain see good days?<br />
      13 Keep thy tongue from evil, * and thy lips, that they speak no guile.<br />
      14 Eschew evil, and do good; * seek peace, and ensue it.<br />
      15 The eyes of the LORD are over the righteous, * and his ears are open unto their prayers.<br />
      16 The countenance of the LORD is against them that do evil, * to root out the remembrance of them from the earth.<br />
      17 The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth them, * and delivereth them out of all their troubles.<br />
      18 The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart, * and will save such as be of an humble spirit.<br />
      19 Great are the troubles of the righteous; * but the LORD delivereth him out of all.<br />
      20 He keepeth all his bones, * so that not one of them is broken.<br />
      21 But misfortune shall slay the ungodly; * and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate.<br />
    22 The LORD delivereth the souls of his servants; * and all they that put their trust in him shall not be destitute.
