    <p><strong>Psalm 95. Venite, exultemus.</strong><br />
      O COME, let us sing unto the LORD; * let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our salvation.<br />
      2 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving; * and show ourselves glad in him with psalms.<br />
      3 For the LORD is a great God; * and a great King above all gods.<br />
      4 In his hand are all the corners of the earth; * and the strength of the hills is his also.<br />
      5 The sea is his, and he made it; * and his hands prepared the dry land.<br />
      6 O come, let us worship and fall down, * and kneel before the LORD our Maker.<br />
      7 For he is the Lord our God; * and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand.<br />
      8 To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts * as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness;<br />
      9 When your fathers tempted me, * proved me, and saw my works.<br />
      10 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, * It is a people that do err in their hearts, for they have not known my ways:<br />
      11 Unto whom I sware in my wrath, * that they should not enter into my rest.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 96. Cantate Domino</strong>.<br />
      O SING unto the LORD a new song; * sing unto the LORD, all the whole earth.<br />
      2 Sing unto the LORD, and praise his Name; * be telling of his salvation from day to day.<br />
      3 Declare his honour unto the heathen, * and his wonders unto all peoples.<br />
      4 For the LORD is great, and cannot worthily be praised;* he is more to be feared than all gods.<br />
      5 As for all the gods of the heathen, they are but idols; * but it is the LORD that made the heavens.<br />
      6 Glory and worship are before him; * power and honour are in his sanctuary.<br />
      7 Ascribe unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the peoples, * ascribe unto the LORD worship and power.<br />
      8 Ascribe unto the LORD the honour due unto his Name; * bring presents, and come into his courts.<br />
      9 O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness; * let the whole earth stand in awe of him.<br />
      10 Tell it out among the heathen, that the LORD is King, and that it is he who hath made the round world so fast that it cannot be moved; * and how that he shall judge the peoples righteously.<br />
      11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; * let the sea make a noise, and all that therein is.<br />
      12 Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it; * then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice before the LORD.<br />
      13 For he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth; * and with righteousness to judge the world, and the peoples with his truth.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 97. Dominus regnavit.</strong><br />
      THE LORD is King, the earth may be glad thereof; * yea, the multitude of the isles may be glad thereof.<br />
      2 Clouds and darkness are round about him: * righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his seat.<br />
      3 There shall go a fire before him, * and burn up his enemies on every side.<br />
      4 His lightnings gave shine unto the world: * the earth saw it, and was afraid.<br />
      5 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD; * at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.<br />
      6 The heavens have declared his righteousness, * and all the peoples have seen his glory.<br />
      7 Confounded be all they that worship carved images, and that delight in vain gods: * worship him, all ye gods.<br />
      8 Sion heard of it, and rejoiced; and the daughters of Judah were glad, * because of thy judgments, O LORD.<br />
      9 For thou, LORD, art higher than all that are in the earth: * thou art exalted far above all gods.<br />
      10 O ye that love the LORD, see that ye hate the thing which is evil: * the Lord preserveth the souls of his saints; he shall deliver them from the hand of the ungodly.<br />
      11 There is sprung up a light for the righteous, * and joyful gladness for such as are true-hearted.<br />
    12 Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; * and give thanks for a remembrance of his holiness.
