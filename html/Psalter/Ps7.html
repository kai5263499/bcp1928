      <P><B>Psalms 7. Domine, Deus meus.</B><BR>
      O LORD my God, in thee have I put my trust: * save me from all
      them that persecute me, and deliver me;<BR>
      2 Lest he devour my soul like a lion, and tear it in pieces,
      * while there is none to help.<BR>
      3 O LORD my God, if I have done any such thing; * or if there
      be any wickedness in my hands;<BR>
      4 If I have rewarded evil unto him that dealt friendly with me;
      * (yea, I have delivered him that without any cause is mine enemy;)<BR>
      5 Then let mine enemy persecute my soul, and take me; * yea,
      let him tread my life down upon the earth, and lay mine honour
      in the dust.<BR>
      6 Stand up, O LORD, in thy wrath, and lift up thyself, because
      of the indignation of mine enemies; * arise up for me in the
      judgment that thou hast commanded.<BR>
      7 And so shall the congregation of the peoples come about thee:
      * for their sakes therefore lift up thyself again.<BR>
      8 The LORD shall judge the peoples: give sentence with me, O
      LORD, * according to my righteousness, and according to the innocency
      that is in me.<BR>
      9 O let the wickedness of the ungodly come to an end; * but guide
      thou the just.<BR>
      10 For the righteous God * trieth the very hearts and reins.<BR>
      11 My help cometh of God, * who preserveth them that are true
      of heart.<BR>
      12 God is a righteous Judge, strong, and patient; * and God is
      provoked every day.<BR>
      13 If a man will not turn, he will whet his sword; * he hath
      bent his bow, and made it ready.<BR>
      14 He hath prepared for him the instruments of death; * he ordaineth
      his arrows against the persecutors.<BR>
      15 Behold, the ungodly travaileth with iniquity; * he hath conceived
      mischief, and brought forth falsehood.<BR>
      16 He hath graven and digged up a pit, * and is fallen himself
      into the destruction that he made for other.<BR>
      17 For his travail shall come upon his own head, * and his wickedness
      shall fall on his own pate.<BR>
      18 I will give thanks unto the LORD, according to his righteousness;
      * and I will praise the Name of the LORD Most High.
