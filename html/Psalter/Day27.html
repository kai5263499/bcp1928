      <P><CENTER>The Twenty-seventh Day.<BR>
<BR>
      Morning Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 120. Ad Dominum.</B><BR>
      WHEN I was in trouble, I called upon the LORD, * and he heard
      me.<BR>
      2 Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, * and from a deceitful
      tongue.<BR>
      3 What reward shall be given or done unto thee, thou false tongue?
      * even mighty and sharp arrows, with hot burning coals.<BR>
      4 Woe is me, that I am constrained to dwell with Meshech, * and
      to have my habitation among the tents of Kedar!<BR>
      5 My soul hath long dwelt among them * that are enemies unto
      peace.<BR>
      6 I labour for peace; but when I speak unto them thereof, * they
      make them ready to battle.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 121. Levavi oculos.</B><BR>
      I WILL lift up mine eyes unto the hills; * from whence cometh
      my help?<BR>
      2 My help cometh even from the LORD, * who hath made heaven and
      earth.<BR>
      3 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved; * and he that keepeth
      thee will not sleep.<BR>
      4 Behold, he that keepeth Israel * shall neither slumber nor
      sleep.<BR>
      5 The LORD himself is thy keeper; * the LORD is thy defence upon
      thy right hand;<BR>
      6 So that the sun shall not burn thee by day, * neither the moon
      by night.<BR>
      7 The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil; * yea, it is even
      he that shall keep thy soul.<BR>
      8 The LORD shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming in, *
      from this time forth for evermore.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 122. Laetatus sum.</B><BR>
      I WAS glad when they said unto me, * We will go into the house
      of the LORD.<BR>
      2 Our feet shall stand in thy gates, * O Jerusalem.<BR>
      3 Jerusalem is built as a city * that is at unity in itself.<BR>
      4 For thither the tribes go up, even the tribes of the LORD,
      * to testify unto Israel, to give thanks unto the Name of the
      LORD.<BR>
      5 For there is the seat of judgment, * even the seat of the house
      of David.<BR>
      6 O pray for the peace of Jerusalem; * they shall prosper that
      love thee.<BR>
      7 Peace be within thy walls, * and plenteousness within thy palaces.<BR>
      8 For my brethren and companions' sakes, * I will wish thee prosperity.<BR>
      9 Yea, because of the house of the LORD our God, * I will seek
      to do thee good.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 123. Ad te levavi oculos meos.</B><BR>
      UNTO thee lift I up mine eyes, * O thou that dwellest in the
      heavens.<BR>
      2 Behold, even as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of
      their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her
      mistress, * even so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until
      he have mercy upon us.<BR>
      3 Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us; * for we are
      utterly despised.<BR>
      4 Our soul is filled with the scornful reproof of the wealthy,
      * and with the despitefulness of the proud.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 124. Nisi quia Dominus.</B><BR>
      IF the LORD himself had not been on our side, now may Israel
      say; * if the LORD himself had not been on our side, when men
      rose up against us;<BR>
      2 They had swallowed us up alive; * when they were so wrathfully
      displeased at us.<BR>
      3 Yea, the waters had drowned us, * and the stream had gone over
      our soul.<BR>
      4 The deep waters of the proud * had gone even over our soul.<BR>
      5 But praised be the LORD, * who hath not given us over for a
      prey unto their teeth.<BR>
      6 Our soul is escaped even as a bird out of the snare of the
      fowler; * the snare is broken, and we are delivered.<BR>
      7 Our help standeth in the Name of the LORD, * who hath made
      heaven and earth.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 125. Qui confidunt.</B><BR>
      THEY that put their trust in the LORD shall be even as the mount
      Sion, * which may not be removed, but standeth fast for ever.<BR>
      2 The hills stand about Jerusalem; * even so standeth the LORD
      round about his people, from this time forth for evermore.<BR>
      3 For the sceptre of the ungodly shall not abide upon the lot
      of the righteous; * lest the righteous put their hand unto wickedness.<BR>
      4 Do well, O LORD, * unto those that are good and true of heart.<BR>
      5 As for such as turn back unto their own wickedness, * the LORD
      shall lead them forth with the evil doers; but peace shall be
      upon Israel.<BR>

      <P><CENTER><A NAME="anchor474864"></A>Evening Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 126. In convertendo.</B><BR>
      WHEN the LORD turned again the captivity of Sion, then were we
      like unto them that dream.<BR>
      2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, * and our tongue with
      joy.<BR>
      3 Then said they among the heathen, * The LORD hath done great
      things for them.<BR>
      4 Yea, the LORD hath done great things for us already; * whereof
      we rejoice.<BR>
      5 Turn our captivity, O LORD, * as the rivers in the south.<BR>
      6 They that sow in tears * shall reap in joy.<BR>
      7 He that now goeth on his way weeping, and beareth forth good
      seed, * shall doubtless come again with joy, and bring his sheaves
      with him.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 127. Nisi Dominus.</B><BR>
      EXCEPT the LORD build the house, * their labour is but lost that
      build it.<BR>
      2 Except the LORD keep the city, * the watchman waketh but in
      vain.<BR>
      3 It is but lost labour that ye haste to rise up early, and so
      late take rest, and eat the bread of carefulness; * for so he
      giveth his beloved sleep.<BR>
      4 Lo, children, and the fruit of the womb, * are an heritage
      and gift that cometh of the LORD.<BR>
      5 Like as the arrows in the hand of the giant, * even so are
      the young children.<BR>
      6 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them; * they
      shall not be ashamed when they speak with their enemies in the
      gate.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 128. Beati omnes.</B><BR>
      BLESSED are all they that fear the LORD, * and walk in his ways.<BR>
      2 For thou shalt eat the labours of thine hands: * O well is
      thee, and happy shalt thou be.<BR>
      3 Thy wife shall be as the fruitful vine * upon the walls of
      thine house;<BR>
      4 Thy children like the olive-branches * round about thy table.<BR>
      5 Lo, thus shall the man be blessed * that feareth the LORD.<BR>
      6 The LORD from out of Sion shall so bless thee, * that thou
      shalt see Jerusalem in prosperity all thy life long;<BR>
      7 Yea, that thou shalt see thy children's children, * and peace
      upon Israel.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 129. Saepe expugnaverunt.</B><BR>
      MANY a time have they fought against me from my youth up, * may
      Israel now say;<BR>
      2 Yea, many a time have they vexed me from my youth up; * but
      they have not prevailed against me.<BR>
      3 The plowers plowed upon my back, * and made long furrows.<BR>
      4 But the righteous LORD * hath hewn the snares of the ungodly
      in pieces.<BR>
      5 Let them be confounded and turned backward, * as many as have
      evil will at Sion.<BR>
      6 Let them be even as the grass upon the housetops, * which withereth
      afore it be grown up;<BR>
      7 Whereof the mower filleth not his hand, * neither he that bindeth
      up the sheaves his bosom.<BR>
      8 So that they who go by say not so much as, The LORD prosper
      you; * we wish you good luck in the Name of the LORD.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 130. De profundis.</B><BR>
      OUT of the deep have I called unto thee, O LORD; * Lord, hear
      my voice.<BR>
      2 O let thine ears consider well * the voice of my complaint.<BR>
      3 If thou, LORD, wilt be extreme to mark what is done amiss,
      * O Lord, who may abide it?<BR>
      4 For there is mercy with thee; * therefore shalt thou be feared.<BR>
      5 I look for the LORD; my soul doth wait for him; * in his word
      is my trust.<BR>
      6 My soul fleeth unto the Lord before the morning watch; * I
      say, before the morning watch.<BR>
      7 O Israel, trust in the LORD; for with the LORD there is mercy,
      * and with him is plenteous redemption.<BR>
      8 And he shall redeem Israel * from all his sins.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 131. Domine, non est.</B><BR>
      LORD, I am not high-minded; * I have no proud looks.<BR>
      2 I do not exercise myself in great matters * which are too high
      for me.<BR>
      3 But I refrain my soul, and keep it low, like as a child that
      is weaned from his mother: * yea, my soul is even as a weaned
      child.<BR>
      4 O Israel, trust in the LORD * from this time forth for evermore.<BR>
