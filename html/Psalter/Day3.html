      The Third Day.<BR>
<BR>
      Morning Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 15. Domine, quis habitabit?</B><BR>
      LORD, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? * or who shall rest
      upon thy holy hill?<BR>
      2 Even he that leadeth an uncorrupt life, * and doeth the thing
      which is right, and speaketh the truth from his heart.<BR>
      3 He that hath used no deceit in his tongue, nor done evil to
      his neighbour, * and hath not slandered his neighbour.<BR>
      4 He that setteth not by himself, but is lowly in his own eyes,
      * and maketh much of them that fear the LORD.<BR>
      5 He that sweareth unto his neighbour, and disappointeth him
      not, * though it were to his own hindrance.<BR>
      6 He that hath not given his money upon usury, * nor taken reward
      against the innocent.<BR>
      7 Whoso doeth these things * shall never fall.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 16. Conserva me, Domine.</B><BR>
      PRESERVE me, O God; * for in thee have I put my trust.<BR>
      2 O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, * Thou art my God;
      I have no good like unto thee.<BR>
      3 All my delight is upon the saints that are in the earth, *
      and upon such as excel in virtue.<BR>
      4 But they that run after another god * shall have great trouble.<BR>
      5 Their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, * neither
      make mention of their names within my lips.<BR>
      6 The LORD himself is the portion of mine inheritance, and of
      my cup; * thou shalt maintain my lot.<BR>
      7 The lot is fallen unto me in a fair ground; * yea, I have a
      goodly heritage.<BR>
      8 I will thank the LORD for giving me warning; * my reins also
      chasten me in the night season.<BR>
      9 I have set the LORD alway before me; * for he is on my right
      hand, therefore I shall not fall.<BR>
      10 Wherefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: * my flesh
      also shall rest in hope.<BR>
      11 For why? thou shalt not leave my soul in hell; * neither shalt
      thou suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.<BR>
      12 Thou shalt show me the path of life: in thy presence is the
      fulness of joy, * and at thy right hand there is pleasure for
      evermore.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 17. Exaudi, Domine.</B><BR>
      HEAR the right, O LORD, consider my complaint, * and hearken
      unto my prayer, that goeth not out-of feigned lips.<BR>
      2 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; * and let thine
      eyes look upon the thing that is equal.<BR>
      3 Thou hast proved and visited mine heart in the night season;
      thou hast tried me, and shalt find no wickedness in me; * for
      I am utterly purposed that my mouth shall not offend.<BR>
      4 As for the works of men, * by the word of thy lips I have kept
      me from the ways of the destroyer.<BR>
      5 O hold thou up my goings in thy paths, * that my footsteps
      slip not.<BR>
      6 I have called upon thee, O God, for thou shalt hear me: * incline
      thine ear to me, and hearken unto my words.<BR>
      7 Show thy marvellous loving-kindness, thou that art the Saviour
      of them which put their trust in thee, * from such as resist
      thy right hand.<BR>
      8 Keep me as the apple of an eye; * hide me under the shadow
      of thy wings,<BR>
      9 From the ungodly, that trouble me; * mine enemies compass me
      round about, to take away my soul.<BR>
      10 They are inclosed in their own fat, * and their mouth speaketh
      proud things.<BR>
      11 They lie waiting in our way on every side, * watching to cast
      us down to the ground;<BR>
      12 Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, * and as it were
      a lion's whelp lurking in secret places.<BR>
      13 Up, LORD, disappoint him, and cast him down; * deliver my
      soul from the ungodly, by thine own sword;<BR>
      14 Yea, by thy hand, O LORD; from the men of the evil world;
      * which have their portion in this life, whose bellies thou fillest
      with thy hid treasure.<BR>
      15 They have children at their desire, * and leave the rest of
      their substance for their babes.<BR>
      16 But as for me, I shall behold thy presence in righteousness;
      * and when I awake up after thy likeness, I shall be satisfied.<BR>

      <P><B>Psalm 18. Diligam te, Domine.</B><BR>
      I WILL love thee, O LORD, my strength. * The LORD is my stony
      rock, and my defence;<BR>
      2 My Saviour, my God, and my might, in whom I will trust; * my
      buckler, the horn also of my salvation, and my refuge.<BR>
      3 I will call upon the LORD, which is worthy to be praised; *
      so shall I be safe from mine enemies.<BR>
      4 The sorrows of death compassed me, * and the overflowings of
      ungodliness made me afraid.<BR>
      5 The pains of hell came about me; * the snares of death overtook
      me.<BR>
      6 In my trouble I called upon the LORD, * and complained unto
      my God:<BR>
      7 So he heard my voice out of his holy temple, * and my complaint
      came before him; it entered even into his ears.<BR>
      8 The earth trembled and quaked, * the very foundations also
      of the hills shook, and were removed, because he was wroth.<BR>
      9 There went a smoke out in his presence, * and a consuming fire
      out of his mouth, so that coals were kindled at it.<BR>
      10 He bowed the heavens also, and came down, * and it was dark
      under his feet.<BR>
      11 He rode upon the Cherubim, and did fly; * he came flying upon
      the wings of the wind.<BR>
      12 He made darkness his secret place, * his pavilion round about
      him with dark water, and thick clouds to cover him.<BR>
      13 At the brightness of his presence his clouds removed; * hailstones
      and coals of fire.<BR>
      14 The LORD also thundered out of heaven, and the Highest gave
      his thunder; * hailstones and coals of fire.<BR>
      15 He sent out his arrows, and scattered them; * he cast forth
      lightnings, and destroyed them.<BR>
      16 The springs of waters were seen, and the foundations of the
      round world were discovered, * at thy chiding, O LORD, at the
      blasting of the breath of thy displeasure.<BR>
      17 He sent down from on high to fetch me, * and took me out of
      many waters.<BR>
      18 He delivered me from my strongest enemy, and from them which
      hate me; * for they were too mighty for me.<BR>
      19 They came upon me in the day of my trouble; * but the LORD
      was my upholder.<BR>
      20 He brought me forth also into a place of liberty; * he brought
      me forth, even because he had a favour unto me.<BR>
      21 The LORD rewarded me after my righteous dealing, * according
      to the cleanness of my hands did he recompense me.<BR>
      22 Because I have kept the ways of the LORD, * and have not forsaken
      my God, as the wicked doth.<BR>
      23 For I have an eye unto all his laws, * and will not cast out
      his commandments from me.<BR>
      24 I was also uncorrupt before him, * and eschewed mine own wickedness.<BR>
      25 Therefore the LORD rewarded me after my righteous dealing,
      * and according unto the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.<BR>
      26 With the holy thou shalt be holy, * and with a perfect man
      thou shalt be perfect.<BR>
      27 With the clean thou shalt be clean, * and with the froward
      thou shalt be froward.<BR>
      28 For thou shalt save the people that are in adversity, and
      shalt bring down the high looks of the proud.<BR>
      29 Thou also shalt light my candle; * the LORD my God shall make
      my darkness to be light.<BR>
      30 For in thee I shall discomfit an host of men, * and with the
      help of my God I shall leap over the wall.<BR>
      31 The way of God is an undefiled way: * the word of the LORD
      also is tried in the fire; he is the defender of all them that
      put their trust in him.<BR>
      32 For who is God, but the LORD? * or who hath any strength,
      except our God?<BR>
      33 It is God that girdeth me with strength of war, * and maketh
      my way perfect.<BR>
      34 He maketh my feet like harts' feet, * and setteth me up on
      high.<BR>
      35 He teacheth mine hands to fight, * and mine arms shall bend
      even a bow of steel.<BR>
      36 Thou hast given me the defence of thy salvation; * thy right
      hand also shall hold me up, and thy loving correction shall make
      me great.<BR>
      37 Thou shalt make room enough under me for to go, * that my
      footsteps shall not slide.<BR>
      38 I will follow upon mine enemies, and overtake them; * neither
      will I turn again till I have destroyed them.<BR>
      39 I will smite them, that they shall not be able to stand, *
      but fall under my feet.<BR>
      40 Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle; * thou
      shalt throw down mine enemies under me.<BR>
      41 Thou hast made mine enemies also to turn their backs upon
      me, * and I shall destroy them that hate me.<BR>
      42 They shall cry, but there shall be none to help them; * yea,
      even unto the LORD shall they cry, but he shall not hear them.<BR>
      43 I will beat them as small as the dust before the wind: * I
      will cast them out as the clay in the streets.<BR>
      44 Thou shalt deliver me from the strivings of the people, *
      and thou shalt make me the head of the nations; a people whom
      I have not known shall serve me.<BR>
      45 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me; * the strangers
      shall feign obedience unto me.<BR>
      46 The strangers shall fail, * and come trembling out of their
      strongholds.<BR>
      47 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my strong helper, * and praised
      be the God of my salvation;<BR>
      48 Even the God that seeth that I be avenged, * and subdueth
      the people unto me.<BR>
      49 It is he that delivereth me from my cruel enemies, and setteth
      me up above mine adversaries: * thou shalt rid me from the wicked
      man.<BR>
      50 For this cause will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among
      the Gentiles, * and sing praises unto thy Name.<BR>
      51 Great prosperity giveth he unto his King, * and showeth loving-kindness
      unto David his anointed, and unto his seed for evermore.</P>
