      <P><B>Psalms 46. Deus noster refugium.</B><BR>
      GOD is our hope and strength, * a very present help in trouble.<BR>
      2 Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be moved, * and
      though the hills be carried into the midst of the sea;<BR>
      3 Though the waters thereof rage and swell, * and though the
      mountains shake at the tempest of the same.<BR>
      4 There is a river, the streams whereof make glad the city of
      God; * the holy place of the tabernacle of the Most Highest.<BR>
      5 God is in the midst of her, therefore shall she not be removed;
      * God shall help her, and that right early.<BR>
      6 The nations make much ado, and the kingdoms are moved; * but
      God hath showed his voice, and the earth shall melt away.<BR>
      7 The LORD of hosts is with us; * the God of Jacob is our refuge.<BR>
      8 O come hither, and behold the works of the LORD, * what destruction
      he hath brought upon the earth.<BR>
      9 He maketh wars to cease in all the world; * he breaketh the
      bow, and knappeth the spear in sunder, and burneth the chariots
      in the fire.<BR>
      10 Be still then, and know that I am God: * I will be exalted
      among the nations, and I will be exalted in the earth.<BR>
      11 The LORD of hosts is with us; * the God of Jacob is our refuge.
