    <p><strong>Psalm 30. Exaltabo te, Domine.</strong><br />
      I WILL magnify thee, O LORD; for thou hast set me up, * and not made my foes to triumph over me.<br />
      2 O LORD my God, I cried unto thee; * and thou hast healed me.<br />
      3 Thou, LORD, hast brought my soul out of hell: * thou hast kept my life, that I should not go down into the pit.<br />
      4 Sing praises unto the LORD, O ye saints of his; * and give thanks unto him, for a remembrance of his holiness.<br />
      5 For his wrath endureth but the twinkling of an eye, and in his pleasure is life; * heaviness may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.<br />
      6 And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be removed: * thou, LORD, of thy goodness, hast made my hill so strong.<br />
      7 Thou didst turn thy face from me, * and I was troubled.<br />
      8 Then cried I unto thee, O LORD; * and gat me to my LORD right humbly.<br />
      9 What profit is there in my blood, * when I go down into the pit?<br />
      10 Shall the dust give thanks unto thee? * or shall it declare thy truth?<br />
      11 Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me; * LORD, be thou my helper.<br />
      12 Thou hast turned my heaviness into joy; * thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness:<br />
      13 Therefore shall every good man sing of thy praise without ceasing. * O my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 31. In te, Domine, speravi.</strong><br />
      IN thee, O LORD, have I put my trust; let me never be put to confusion; * deliver me in thy righteousness.<br />
      2 Bow down thine ear to me; * make haste to deliver me.<br />
      3 And be thou my strong rock, and house of defence, * that thou mayest save me.<br />
      4 For thou art my strong rock, and my castle: * be thou also my guide, and lead me for thy Name's sake.<br />
      5 Draw me out of the net that they have laid privily for me; * for thou art my strength.<br />
      6 Into thy hands I commend my spirit; * for thou hast redeemed me, O LORD, thou God of truth.<br />
      7 I have hated them that hold of lying vanities, * and my trust hath been in the LORD.<br />
      8 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy; * for thou hast considered my trouble, and hast known my soul in adversities.<br />
      9 Thou hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy; * but hast set my feet in a large room.<br />
      10 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble, * and mine eye is consumed for very heaviness; yea, my soul and my body.<br />
      11 For my life is waxen old with heaviness, * and my years with mourning.<br />
      12 My strength faileth me, because of mine iniquity, * and my bones are consumed.<br />
      13 I became a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours; * and they of mine acquaintance were afraid of me; and they that did see me without, conveyed themselves from me.<br />
      14 I am clean forgotten as a dead man out of mind; * I am become like a broken vessel.<br />
      15 For I have heard the blasphemy of the multitude, and fear is on every side; * while they conspire together against me, and take their counsel to take away my life.<br />
      16 But my hope hath been in thee, O LORD; * I have said, Thou art my God.<br />
      17 My times are in thy hand; deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, * and from them that persecute me.<br />
      18 Show thy servant the light of thy countenance, * and save me for thy mercy's sake.<br />
      19 Let me not be confounded, O LORD, for I have called upon thee; * let the ungodly be put to confusion, and be put to silence in the grave.<br />
      20 Let the lying lips be put to silence, * which cruelly, disdainfully, and despitefully speak against the righteous.<br />
      21 O how plentiful is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee, * and that thou hast prepared for them that put their trust in thee, even before the sons of men!<br />
      22 Thou shalt hide them in the covert of thine own presence from the plottings of men: * thou shalt keep them secretly in thy tabernacle from the strife of tongues.<br />
      23 Thanks be to the LORD; * for he hath showed me marvellous great kindness in a strong city.<br />
      24 But in my haste I said, * I am cast out of the sight of thine eyes.<br />
      25 Nevertheless, thou heardest the voice of my prayer, * when I cried unto thee.<br />
      26 O love the LORD, all ye his saints; * for the LORD preserveth them that are faithful, and plenteously rewardeth the proud doer.<br />
    27 Be strong, and he shall establish your heart, * all ye that put your trust in the LORD.
