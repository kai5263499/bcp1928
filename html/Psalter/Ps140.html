      <P><B>Psalm 140. Eripe me, Domine.</B><BR>
      DELIVER me, O LORD, from the evil man; * and preserve me from
      the wicked man;<BR>
      2 Who imagine mischief in their hearts, * and stir up strife
      all the day long.<BR>
      3 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; * adder's
      poison is under their lips.<BR>
      4 Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the ungodly; * preserve
      me from the wicked men, who are purposed to overthrow my goings.<BR>
      5 The proud have laid a snare for me, and spread a net abroad
      with cords; * yea, and set traps in my way.<BR>
      6 I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God, * hear the voice of
      my prayers, O LORD.<BR>
      7 O LORD God, thou strength of my health; * thou hast covered
      my head in the day of battle.<BR>
      8 Let not the ungodly have his desire, O LORD; * let not his
      mischievous imagination prosper, lest they be too proud.<BR>
      9 Let the mischief of their own lips fall upon the head of them
      * that compass me about.<BR>
      10 Let hot burning coals fall upon them; * let them be cast into
      the fire, and into the pit, that they never rise up again.<BR>
      11 A man full of words shall not prosper upon the earth: * evil
      shall hunt the wicked person to overthrow him.<BR>
      12 Sure I am that the LORD will avenge the poor, * and maintain
      the cause of the helpless.<BR>
      13 The righteous also shall give thanks unto thy Name; * and
      the just shall continue in thy sight.
