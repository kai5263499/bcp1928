    <p><strong>Psalm 147. Laudate Dominum.</strong><br />
      PRAISE the LORD, for it is a good thing to sing praises unto our God; * yea, a joyful and pleasant thing it is to be thankful.<br />
      2 The LORD doth build up Jerusalem, * and gather together the outcasts of Israel.<br />
      3 He healeth those that are broken in heart, * and giveth medicine to heal their sickness.<br />
      4 He telleth the number of the stars, * and calleth them all by their names.<br />
      5 Great is our Lord, and great is his power; * yea, and his wisdom is infinite.<br />
      6 The LORD setteth up the meek, * and bringeth the ungodly down to the ground.<br />
      7 O sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; * sing praises upon the harp unto our God:<br />
      8 Who covereth the heaven with clouds, and prepareth rain for the earth; * and maketh the grass to grow upon the mountains, and herb for the use of men;<br />
      9 Who giveth fodder unto the cattle, * and feedeth the young ravens that call upon him.<br />
      10 He hath no pleasure in the strength of an horse; * neither delighteth he in any man's legs.<br />
      11 But the LORD'S delight is in them that fear him, * and put their trust in his mercy. ~<br />
      12 Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; * praise thy God, O Sion.<br />
      13 For he hath made fast the bars of thy gates, * and hath blessed thy children within thee.<br />
      14 He maketh peace in thy borders, * and filleth thee with the flour of wheat.<br />
      15 He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth, * and his word runneth very swiftly.<br />
      16 He giveth snow like wool, * and scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes.<br />
      17 He casteth forth his ice like morsels: * who is able to abide his frost?<br />
      18 He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: * he bloweth with his wind, and the waters flow.<br />
      19 He showeth his word unto Jacob, * his statutes and ordinances unto Israel.<br />
      20 He hath not dealt so with any nation; * neither have the heathen knowledge of his laws.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 148. Laudate Dominum.</strong><br />
      O PRAISE the LORD from the heavens: * praise him in the heights.<br />
      2 Praise him, all ye angels of his: * praise him, all his host.<br />
      3 Praise him, sun and moon: * praise him, all ye stars and light.<br />
      4 Praise him, all ye heavens, * and ye waters that are above the heavens.<br />
      5 Let them praise the Name of the LORD: * for he spake the word, and they were made; he commanded, and they were created.<br />
      6 He hath made them fast for ever and ever: * he hath given them a law which shall not be broken.<br />
      7 Praise the LORD from the earth, * ye dragons and all deeps;<br />
      8 Fire and hail, snow and vapours, * wind and storm, fulfilling his word;<br />
      9 Mountains and all hills; * fruitful trees and all cedars;<br />
      10 Beasts and all cattle; * creeping things and flying fowls;<br />
      11 Kings of the earth, and all peoples; * princes, and all judges of the world;<br />
      12 Young men and maidens, old men and children, praise the Name of the LORD: * for his Name only is excellent, and his praise above heaven and earth.<br />
      13 He shall exalt the horn of his people: all his saints shall praise him; * even the children of Israel, even the people that serveth him.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 149. Cantate Domino.</strong><br />
      O SING unto the LORD a new song; * let the congregation of saints praise him.<br />
      2 Let Israel rejoice in him that made him, * and let the children of Sion be joyful in their King.<br />
      3 Let them praise his Name in the dance: * let them sing praises unto him with tabret and harp.<br />
      4 For the LORD hath pleasure in his people, * and helpeth the meek-hearted.<br />
      5 Let the saints be joyful with glory; * let them rejoice in their beds.<br />
      6 Let the praises of God be in their mouth; * and a two-edged sword in their hands;<br />
      7 To be avenged of the nations, * and to rebuke the peoples;<br />
      8 To bind their kings in chains, * and their nobles with links of iron;<br />
      9 To execute judgment upon them; as it is written, * Such honour have all his saints.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 150. Laudate Dominum.</strong><br />
      O PRAISE God in his sanctuary: * praise him in the firmament of his power.<br />
      2 Praise him in his noble acts: * praise him according to his excellent greatness.<br />
      3 Praise him in the sound of the trumpet: * praise him upon the lute and harp.<br />
      4 Praise him in the timbrels and dances: * praise him upon the strings and pipe.<br />
      5 Praise him upon the well-tuned cymbals: * praise him upon the loud cymbals.<br />
    6 Let every thing that hath breath * praise the LORD.
