      The Fifth Day.<BR>
<BR>
      Morning Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 24. Domini est terra.</B><BR>
      THE earth is the LORD'S, and all that therein is; * the compass
      of the world, and they that dwell therein.<BR>
      2 For he hath founded it upon the seas, * and stablished it upon
      the floods.<BR>
      3 Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? * or who shall
      rise up in his holy place?<BR>
      4 Even he that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; * and that
      hath not lift up his mind unto vanity, nor sworn to deceive his
      neighbour.<BR>
      5 He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, * and righteousness
      from the God of his salvation.<BR>
      6 This is the generation of them that seek him; * even of them
      that seek thy face, O God of Jacob.<BR>
      7 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting
      doors; * and the King of glory shall come in.<BR>
      8 Who is this King of glory? * It is the LORD strong and mighty,
      even the LORD mighty in battle.<BR>
      9 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting
      doors; * and the King of glory shall come in.<BR>
      10 Who is this King of glory? * Even the LORD of hosts, he is
      the King of glory.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 25. Ad te, Domine, levavi.</B><BR>
      UNTO thee, O LORD, will I lift up my soul; my God, I have put
      my trust in thee: * O let me not be confounded, neither let mine
      enemies triumph over me.<BR>
      2 For all they that hope in thee shall not be ashamed; * but
      such as transgress without a cause shall be put to confusion.<BR>
      3 Show me thy ways, O LORD, * and teach me thy paths.<BR>
      4 Lead me forth in thy truth, and learn me: * for thou art the
      God of my salvation; in thee hath been my hope all the day long.<BR>
      5 Call to remembrance, O LORD, thy tender mercies, * and thy
      loving-kindnesses, which have been ever of old.<BR>
      6 O remember not the sins and offences of my youth; * but according
      to thy mercy think thou upon me, O LORD, for thy goodness.<BR>
      7 Gracious and righteous is the LORD; * therefore, will he teach
      sinners in the way.<BR>
      8 Them that are meek shall he guide in judgment; * and such as
      are gentle, them shall he learn his way.<BR>
      9 All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth, * unto such
      as keep his covenant and his testimonies.<BR>
      10 For thy Name's sake, O LORD, * be merciful unto my sin; for
      it is great.<BR>
      11 What man is he that feareth the LORD? * him shall he teach
      in the way that he shall choose.<BR>
      12 His soul shall dwell at ease, * and his seed shall inherit
      the land.<BR>
      13 The secret of the LORD is among them that fear him; * and
      he will show them his covenant.<BR>
      14 Mine eyes are ever looking unto the LORD; * for he shall pluck
      my feet out of the net.<BR>
      15 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; * for I am desolate,
      and in misery.<BR>
      16 The sorrows of my heart are enlarged: * O bring thou me out
      of my troubles.<BR>
      17 Look upon my adversity and misery, * and forgive me all my
      sin.<BR>
      18 Consider mine enemies, how many they are; * and they bear
      a tyrannous hate against me.<BR>
      19 O keep my soul, and deliver me: * let me not be confounded,
      for I have put my trust in thee.<BR>
      20 Let perfectness and righteous dealing wait upon me; * for
      my hope hath been in thee.<BR>
      21 Deliver Israel, O God, * out of all his troubles.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 26. Judica me, Domine.</B><BR>
      BE thou my Judge, O LORD, for I have walked innocently: * my
      trust hath been also in the LORD, therefore shall I not fall.<BR>
      2 Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; * try out my reins and my
      heart.<BR>
      3 For thy loving-kindness is ever before mine eyes; * and I will
      walk in thy truth.<BR>
      4 I have not dwelt with vain persons; * neither will I have fellowship
      with the deceitful.<BR>
      5 I have hated the congregation of the wicked; * and will not
      sit among the ungodly.<BR>
      6 I will wash my hands in innocency, O LORD; * and so will I
      go to thine altar;<BR>
      7 That I may show the voice of thanksgiving, * and tell of all
      thy wondrous works.<BR>
      8 LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, * and the place
      where thine honour dwelleth.<BR>
      9 O shut not up my soul with the sinners, * nor my life with
      the blood-thirsty;<BR>
      10 In whose hands is wickedness, * and their right hand is full
      of gifts.<BR>
      11 But as for me, I will walk innocently: * O deliver me, and
      be merciful unto me.<BR>
      12 My foot standeth right: * I will praise the LORD in the congregations.<BR>

      <P><CENTER><A NAME="anchor487943"></A>Evening Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 27. Dominus illuminatio.</B><BR>
      THE LORD is my light and my salvation; whom then shall I fear?
      * the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom then shall I be
      afraid?<BR>
      2 When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me
      to eat up my flesh, * they stumbled and fell.<BR>
      3 Though an host of men were laid against me, yet shall not my
      heart be afraid; * and though there rose up war against me, yet
      will I put my trust in him.<BR>
      4 One thing have I desired of the LORD, which I will require;
      * even that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days
      of my life, to behold the fair beauty of the LORD, and to visit
      his temple.<BR>
      5 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his tabernacle;
      * yea, in the secret place of his dwelling shall he hide me,
      and set me up upon a rock of stone.<BR>
      6 And now shall he lift up mine head * above mine enemies round
      about me.<BR>
      7 Therefore will I offer in his dwelling an oblation, with great
      gladness: * I will sing and speak praises unto the LORD.<BR>
      8 Hearken unto my voice, O LORD, when I cry unto thee; * have
      mercy upon me, and hear me.<BR>
      9 My heart hath talked of thee, Seek ye my face: * Thy face,
      LORD, will I seek.<BR>
      10 O hide not thou thy face from me, * nor cast thy servant away
      in displeasure.<BR>
      11 Thou hast been my succour; * leave me not, neither forsake
      me, O God of my salvation.<BR>
      12 When my father and my mother forsake me, * the LORD taketh
      me up.<BR>
      13 Teach me thy way, O LORD, * and lead me in the right way,
      because of mine enemies.<BR>
      14 Deliver me not over into the will of mine adversaries: * for
      there are false witnesses risen up against me, and such as speak
      wrong.<BR>
      15 I should utterly have fainted, * but that I believe verily
      to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.<BR>
      16 O tarry thou the LORD'S leisure; * be strong, and he shall
      comfort thine heart; and put thou thy trust in the LORD.<BR>
      <B><BR>
<BR>
      Psalm 28. Ad te, Domine.</B><BR>
      UNTO thee will I cry, O LORD, my strength: * think no scorn of
      me; lest, if thou make as though thou hearest not, I become like
      them that go down into the pit.<BR>
      2 Hear the voice of my humble petitions, when I cry unto thee;
      * when I hold up my hands towards the mercyseat of thy holy temple.<BR>
      3 O pluck me not away, neither destroy me with the ungodly and
      wicked doers, * which speak friendly to their neighbours, but
      imagine mischief in their hearts.<BR>
      4 Reward them according to their deeds, * and according to the
      wickedness of their own inventions.<BR>
      5 Recompense them after the work of their hands; * pay them that
      they have deserved.<BR>
      6 For they regard not in their mind the works of the LORD, nor
      the operation of his hands; * therefore shall he break them down,
      and not build them up.<BR>
      7 Praised be the LORD; * for he hath heard the voice of my humble
      petitions.<BR>
      8 The LORD is my strength, and my shield; my heart hath trusted
      in him, and I am helped; * therefore my heart danceth for joy,
      and in my song will I praise him.<BR>
      9 The LORD is my strength, * and he is the wholesome defence
      of his anointed.<BR>
      10 O save thy people, and give thy blessing unto thine inheritance:
      * feed them, and set them up for ever.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 29. Afferte Domino.</B><BR>
      A SCRIBE unto the LORD, O ye mighty, * ascribe unto the LORD
      worship and strength.<BR>
      2 Ascribe unto the LORD the honour due unto his Name; * worship
      the LORD with holy worship.<BR>
      3 The voice of the LORD is upon the waters; * it is the glorious
      God that maketh the thunder.<BR>
      4 It is the LORD that ruleth the sea; the voice of the LORD is
      mighty in operation; * the voice of the LORD is a glorious voice.<BR>
      5 The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedar-trees; * yea, the
      LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.<BR>
      6 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; * Lebanon also, and
      Sirion, like a young unicorn.<BR>
      7 The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire; the voice
      of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; * yea, the LORD shaketh the
      wilderness of Kadesh.<BR>
      8 The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to bring forth young,
      and strippeth bare the forests: * in his temple doth every thing
      speak of his honour.<BR>
      9 The LORD sitteth above the water-flood, * and the LORD remaineth
      a King for ever.<BR>
      10 The LORD shall give strength unto his people; * the LORD shall
      give his people the blessing of peace.</P>
