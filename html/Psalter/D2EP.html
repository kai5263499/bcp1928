      <strong>Psalm 12. Salvum me fac.</strong><br />
      HELP me, LORD, for there is not one godly man left; * for the faithful are minished from among the children of men.<br />
      2 They talk of vanity every one with his neighbour; * they do but flatter with their lips, and dissemble in their double heart.<br />
      3 The LORD shall root out all deceitful lips, * and the tongue that speaketh proud things;<br />
      4 Which have said, With our tongue will we prevail; * we are they that ought to speak; who is lord over us?<br />
      5 Now, for the comfortless troubles' sake of the needy, * and because of the deep sighing of the poor,<br />
      6 I will up, saith the LORD; * and will help every one from him that swelleth against him, and will set him at rest.<br />
      7 The words of the LORD are pure words; * even as the silver which from the earth is tried, and purified seven times in the fire.<br />
      8 Thou shalt keep them, O LORD; * thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.<br />
    9 The ungodly walk on every side: * when they are exalted, the children of men are put to rebuke.</p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 13. Usquequo, Domine?</strong><br />
      HOW long wilt thou forget me, O LORD; for ever? * how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?<br />
      2 How long shall I seek counsel in my soul, and be so vexed in my heart? * how long shall mine enemy triumph over me?<br />
      3 Consider, and hear me, O LORD my God; * lighten mine eyes, that I sleep not in death;<br />
      4 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him: * for if I be cast down, they that trouble me will rejoice at it.<br />
      5 But my trust is in thy mercy, * and my heart is joyful in thy salvation.<br />
      6 I will sing of the LORD, because he hath dealt so lovingly with me; * yea, I will praise the Name of the Lord Most Highest.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 14. Dixit insipiens.</strong><br />
      THE fool hath said in his heart, * There is no God.<br />
      2 They are corrupt, and become abominable in their doings; * there is none that doeth good, no not one.<br />
      3 The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, * to see if there were any that would understand, and seek after God.<br />
      4 But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become abominable; * there is none that doeth good, no not one.<br />
      5 Have they no knowledge, that they are all such workers of mischief, * eating up my people as it were bread, and call not upon the LORD?<br />
      6 There were they brought in great fear, even where no fear was; * for God is in the generation of the righteous.<br />
      7 As for you, ye have made a mock at the counsel of the poor; * because he putteth his trust in the LORD.<br />
    8 Who shall give salvation unto Israel out of Sion? * When the LORD turneth the captivity of his people, then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.</p>
