    <p><strong>Psalm 75. Confitebimur tibi.</strong><br />
      UNTO thee, O God, do we give thanks; * yea, unto thee do we give thanks.<br />
      2 Thy Name also is so nigh; * and that do thy wondrous works declare.<br />
      3 In the appointed time, saith God, * I shall judge according unto right.<br />
      4 The earth is weak, and all the inhabiters thereof: * I bear up the pillars of it.<br />
      5 I said unto the fools, Deal not so madly; * and to the ungodly, Set not up your horn.<br />
      6 Set not up your horn on high, * and speak not with a stiff neck.<br />
      7 For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, * nor yet from the south.<br />
      8 And why? God is the Judge; * he putteth down one, and setteth up another.<br />
      9 For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; * it is full mixt, and he poureth out of the same.<br />
      10 As for the dregs thereof, * all the ungodly of the earth shall drink them, and suck them out.<br />
      11 But I will talk of the God of Jacob, * and praise him for ever.<br />
      12 All the horns of the ungodly also will I break, * and the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 76. Notus in Judaea.</strong><br />
      IN Judah is God known; * his Name is great in Israel.<br />
      2 At Salem is his tabernacle, * and his dwelling in Sion.<br />
      3 There brake he the arrows of the bow, * the shield, the sword, and the battle.<br />
      4 Thou art glorious in might, * when thou comest from the hills of the robbers.<br />
      5 The proud are robbed, they have slept their sleep; * and all the men whose hands were mighty have found nothing.<br />
      6 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, * both the chariot and horse are fallen.<br />
      7 Thou, even thou art to be feared; * and who may stand in thy sight when thou art angry?<br />
      8 Thou didst cause thy judgment to be heard from heaven; * the earth trembled, and was still,<br />
      9 When God arose to judgment, * and to help all the meek upon earth.<br />
      10 The fierceness of man shall turn to thy praise; * and the fierceness of them shalt thou refrain.<br />
      11 Promise unto the LORD your God, and keep it, all ye that are round about him; * bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.<br />
    12 He shall refrain the spirit of princes, * and is wonderful among the kings of the earth.</p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 77. Voce mea ad Dominum.</strong><br />
      I WILL cry unto God with my voice; * even unto God will I cry with my voice, and he shall hearken unto me.<br />
      2 In the time of my trouble I sought the Lord: * I stretched forth my hands unto him, and ceased not in the night season; my soul refused comfort.<br />
      3 When I am in heaviness, I will think upon God; * when my heart is vexed, I will complain.<br />
      4 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: * I am so feeble that I cannot speak.<br />
      5 I have considered the days of old, * and the years that are past.<br />
      6 I call to remembrance my song, * and in the night I commune with mine own heart, and search out my spirit.<br />
      7 Will the Lord absent himself for ever? * and will he be no more intreated?<br />
      8 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? * and is his promise come utterly to an end for evermore?<br />
      9 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? * and will he shut up his loving-kindness in displeasure?<br />
      10 And I said, It is mine own infirmity; * but I will remember the years of the right hand of the Most Highest.<br />
      11 I will remember the works of the LORD, * and call to mind thy wonders of old time.<br />
      12 I will think also of all thy works, * and my talking shall be of thy doings.<br />
      13 Thy way, O God, is holy: * who is so great a God as our God?<br />
      14 Thou art the God that doest wonders, * and hast declared thy power among the peoples.<br />
      15 Thou hast mightily delivered thy people, * even the sons of Jacob and Joseph.<br />
      16 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee, and were afraid; * the depths also were troubled.<br />
      17 The clouds poured out water, the air thundered, * and thine arrows went abroad.<br />
      18 The voice of thy thunder was heard round about: * the lightnings shone upon the ground; the earth was moved, and shook withal.<br />
      19 Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in the great waters, * and thy footsteps are not known.<br />
    20 Thou leddest thy people like sheep, * by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
