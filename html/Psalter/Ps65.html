      <P><B>Psalm 65. Te decet hymnus.</B><BR>
      THOU, O God, art praised in Sion; * and unto thee shall the vow
      be performed in Jerusalem.<BR>
      2 Thou that hearest the prayer, * unto thee shall all flesh come.<BR>
      3 My misdeeds prevail against me: * O be thou merciful unto our
      sins.<BR>
      4 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and receivest unto thee:
      * he shall dwell in thy court, and shall be satisfied with the
      pleasures of thy house, even of thy holy temple.<BR>
      5 Thou shalt show us wonderful things in thy righteousness, O
      God of our salvation; * thou that art the hope of all the ends
      of the earth, and of them that remain in the broad sea.<BR>
      6 Who in his strength setteth fast the mountains, * and is girded
      about with power.<BR>
      7 Who stilleth the raging of the sea, * and the noise of his
      waves, and the madness of the peoples.<BR>
      8 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts of the earth shall
      be afraid at thy tokens, * thou that makest the out-goings of
      the morning and evening to praise thee.<BR>
      9 Thou visitest the earth, and blessest it; * thou makest it
      very plenteous.<BR>
      10 The river of God is full of water: * thou preparest their
      corn, for so thou providest for the earth.<BR>
      11 Thou waterest her furrows; thou sendest rain into the little
      valleys thereof; * thou makest it soft with the drops of rain,
      and blessest the increase of it.<BR>
      12 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; * and thy clouds
      drop fatness.<BR>
      13 They shall drop upon the dwellings of the wilderness; * and
      the little hills shall rejoice on every side.<BR>
      14 The folds shall be full of sheep; * the valleys also shall
      stand so thick with corn, that they shall laugh and sing.
