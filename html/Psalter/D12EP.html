    <p><strong>Psalm 65. Te decet hymnus.</strong><br />
      THOU, O God, art praised in Sion; * and unto thee shall the vow be performed in Jerusalem.<br />
      2 Thou that hearest the prayer, * unto thee shall all flesh come.<br />
      3 My misdeeds prevail against me: * O be thou merciful unto our sins.<br />
      4 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and receivest unto thee: * he shall dwell in thy court, and shall be satisfied with the pleasures of thy house, even of thy holy temple.<br />
      5 Thou shalt show us wonderful things in thy righteousness, O God of our salvation; * thou that art the hope of all the ends of the earth, and of them that remain in the broad sea.<br />
      6 Who in his strength setteth fast the mountains, * and is girded about with power.<br />
      7 Who stilleth the raging of the sea, * and the noise of his waves, and the madness of the peoples.<br />
      8 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts of the earth shall be afraid at thy tokens, * thou that makest the out-goings of the morning and evening to praise thee.<br />
      9 Thou visitest the earth, and blessest it; * thou makest it very plenteous.<br />
      10 The river of God is full of water: * thou preparest their corn, for so thou providest for the earth.<br />
      11 Thou waterest her furrows; thou sendest rain into the little valleys thereof; * thou makest it soft with the drops of rain, and blessest the increase of it.<br />
      12 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; * and thy clouds drop fatness.<br />
      13 They shall drop upon the dwellings of the wilderness; * and the little hills shall rejoice on every side.<br />
      14 The folds shall be full of sheep; * the valleys also shall stand so thick with corn, that they shall laugh and sing.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 66. Jubilate Deo.</strong><br />
      O BE joyful in God, all ye lands; * sing praises unto the honour of his Name; make his praise to be glorious.<br />
      2 Say unto God, O how wonderful art thou in thy works! * through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies bow down unto thee.<br />
      3 For all the world shall worship thee, * sing of thee, and praise thy Name.<br />
      4 O come hither, and behold the works of God; * how wonderful he is in his doing toward the children of men.<br />
      5 He turned the sea into dry land, * so that they went through the water on foot; there did we rejoice thereof.<br />
      6 He ruleth with his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: * and such as will not believe shall not be able to exalt themselves.<br />
      7 O praise our God, ye peoples, * and make the voice of his praise to be heard;<br />
      8 Who holdeth our soul in life; * and suffereth not our feet to slip.<br />
      9 For thou, O God, hast proved us; * thou also hast tried us, like as silver is tried.<br />
      10 Thou broughtest us into the snare; * and laidest trouble upon our loins.<br />
      11 Thou sufferedst men to ride over our heads; * we went through fire and water, and thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.<br />
      12 I will go into thine house with burnt-offerings, and will pay thee my vows, * which I promised with my lips, and spake with my mouth, when I was in trouble.<br />
      13 I will offer unto thee fat burnt-sacrifices, with the incense of rams; * I will offer bullocks and goats.<br />
      14 O come hither, and hearken, all ye that fear God; * and I will tell you what he hath done for my soul.<br />
      15 I called unto him with my mouth, * and gave him praises with my tongue.<br />
      16 If I incline unto wickedness with mine heart, * the Lord will not hear me.<br />
      17 But God hath heard me; * and considered the voice of my prayer.<br />
      18 Praised be God, who hath not cast out my prayer, * nor turned his mercy from me.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 67. Deus misereatur.</strong><br />
      GOD be merciful unto us, and bless us, * and show us the light of his countenance, and be merciful unto us;<br />
      2 That thy way may be known upon earth, * thy saving health among all nations.<br />
      3 Let the peoples praise thee, O God; * yea, let all the peoples praise thee.<br />
      4 O let the nations rejoice and be glad; * for thou shalt judge the folk righteously, and govern the nations upon earth.<br />
      5 Let the peoples praise thee, O God; * yea, let all the peoples praise thee.<br />
      6 Then shall the earth bring forth her increase; * and God, even our own God, shall give us his blessing.<br />
    7 God shall bless us; * and all the ends of the world shall fear him.
