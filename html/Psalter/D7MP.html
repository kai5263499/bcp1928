    <p><strong>Psalm 35. Judica, Domine.</strong><br />
      PLEAD thou my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me, * and fight thou against them that fight against me.<br />
      2 Lay hand upon the shield and buckler, * and stand up to help me.<br />
      3 Bring forth the spear, and stop the way against them that pursue me: * say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.<br />
      4 Let them be confounded, and put to shame, that seek after my soul; * let them be turned back, and brought to confusion, that imagine mischief for me.<br />
      5 Let them be as the dust before the wind, * and the angel of the LORD scattering them.<br />
      6 Let their way be dark and slippery, * and let the angel of the LORD pursue them.<br />
      7 For they have privily laid their net to destroy me without a cause; * yea, even without a cause have they made a pit for my soul.<br />
      8 Let a sudden destruction come upon him unawares, and his net that he hath laid privily catch himself; * that he may fall into his own mischief.<br />
      9 And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD; * it shall rejoice in his salvation.<br />
      10 All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, who deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him; * yea, the poor, and him that is in misery, from him that spoileth him?<br />
      11 False witnesses did rise up: * they laid to my charge things that I knew not.<br />
      12 They rewarded me evil for good, * to the great discomfort of my soul.<br />
      13 Nevertheless, when they were sick, I put on sackcloth, and humbled my soul with fasting; * and my prayer shall turn into mine own bosom.<br />
      14 I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother; * I went heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.<br />
      15 But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together; * yea, the very abjects came together against me unawares, making mouths at me, and ceased not.<br />
      16 With the flatterers were busy mockers, * who gnashed upon me with their teeth.<br />
      17 Lord, how long wilt thou look upon this? * O deliver my soul from the calamities which they bring on me, and my darling from the lions.<br />
      18 So will I give thee thanks in the great congregation; * I will praise thee among much people.<br />
      19 O let not them that are mine enemies triumph over me ungodly; * neither let them wink with their eyes, that hate me without a cause.<br />
      20 And why? their communing is not for peace; * but they imagine deceitful words against them that are quiet in the land.<br />
      21 They gaped upon me with their mouths, and said, * Fie on thee! fie on thee! we saw it with our eyes.<br />
      22 This thou hast seen, O LORD; * hold not thy tongue then; go not far from me, O Lord.<br />
      23 Awake, and stand up to judge my quarrel; * avenge thou my cause, my God and my Lord.<br />
      24 Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; * and let them not triumph over me.<br />
      25 Let them not say in their hearts, There! there! so would we have it; * neither let them say, We have devoured him.<br />
      26 Let them be put to confusion and shame together, that rejoice at my trouble; * let them be clothed with rebuke and dishonour, that boast themselves against me.<br />
      27 Let them be glad and rejoice, that favour my righteous dealing; * yea, let them say alway, Blessed be the LORD, who hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.<br />
      28 And as for my tongue, it shall be talking of thy righteousness, * and of thy praise, all the day long.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 36. Dixit injustus.</strong><br />
      MY heart showeth me the wickedness of the ungodly, * that there is no fear of God before his eyes.<br />
      2 For he flattereth himself in his own sight, * until his abominable sin be found out.<br />
      3 The words of his mouth are unrighteous and full of deceit: * he hath left off to behave himself wisely, and to do good.<br />
      4 He imagineth mischief upon his bed, and hath set himself in no good way; * neither doth he abhor any thing that is evil.<br />
      5 Thy mercy, O LORD, reacheth unto the heavens, * and thy faithfulness unto the clouds.<br />
      6 Thy righteousness standeth like the strong mountains: * thy judgments are like the great deep.<br />
      7 Thou, LORD, shalt save both man and beast: how excellent is thy mercy, O God! * and the children of men shall put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.<br />
      8 They shall be satisfied with the plenteousness of thy house; * and thou shalt give them drink of thy pleasures, as out of the river.<br />
      9 For with thee is the well of life; * and in thy light shall we see light.<br />
      10 O continue forth thy loving-kindness unto them that know thee, * and thy righteousness unto them that are true of heart.<br />
      11 O let not the foot of pride come against me; * and let not the hand of the ungodly cast me down.<br />
    12 There are they fallen, all that work wickedness; * they are cast down, and shall not be able to stand.
