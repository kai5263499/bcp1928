      <P><B>Psalms 34. Benedicam Dominum.</B><BR>
      I WILL alway give thanks unto the LORD; * his praise shall ever
      be in my mouth.<BR>
      2 My soul shall make her boast in the LORD; * the humble shall
      hear thereof, and be glad.<BR>
      3 O praise the LORD with me, * and let us magnify his Name together.<BR>
      4 I sought the LORD, and he heard me; * yea, he delivered me
      out of all my fear.<BR>
      5 They had an eye unto him, and were lightened; * and their faces
      were not ashamed.<BR>
      6 Lo, the poor crieth, and the LORD heareth him; * yea, and saveth
      him out of all his troubles.<BR>
      7 The angel of the LORD tarrieth round about them that fear him,
      * and delivereth them.<BR>
      8 O taste, and see, how gracious the LORD is: * blessed is the
      man that trusteth in him.<BR>
      9 O fear the LORD, ye that are his saints; * for they that fear
      him lack nothing.<BR>
      10 The lions do lack, and suffer hunger; * but they who seek
      the LORD shall want no manner of thing that is good.<BR>
      11 Come, ye children, and hearken unto me; * I will teach you
      the fear of the LORD.<BR>
      12 What man is he that lusteth to live, * and would fain see
      good days?<BR>
      13 Keep thy tongue from evil, * and thy lips, that they speak
      no guile.<BR>
      14 Eschew evil, and do good; * seek peace, and ensue it.<BR>
      15 The eyes of the LORD are over the righteous, * and his ears
      are open unto their prayers.<BR>
      16 The countenance of the LORD is against them that do evil,
      * to root out the remembrance of them from the earth.<BR>
      17 The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth them, * and delivereth
      them out of all their troubles.<BR>
      18 The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart, *
      and will save such as be of an humble spirit.<BR>
      19 Great are the troubles of the righteous; * but the LORD delivereth
      him out of all.<BR>
      20 He keepeth all his bones, * so that not one of them is broken.<BR>
      21 But misfortune shall slay the ungodly; * and they that hate
      the righteous shall be desolate.<BR>
      22 The LORD delivereth the souls of his servants; * and all they
      that put their trust in him shall not be destitute.
