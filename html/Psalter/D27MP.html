    <p><strong>Psalm 120. Ad Dominum.</strong><br />
      WHEN I was in trouble, I called upon the LORD, * and he heard me.<br />
      2 Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, * and from a deceitful tongue.<br />
      3 What reward shall be given or done unto thee, thou false tongue? * even mighty and sharp arrows, with hot burning coals.<br />
      4 Woe is me, that I am constrained to dwell with Meshech, * and to have my habitation among the tents of Kedar!<br />
      5 My soul hath long dwelt among them * that are enemies unto peace.<br />
      6 I labour for peace; but when I speak unto them thereof, * they make them ready to battle.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 121. Levavi oculos.</strong><br />
      I WILL lift up mine eyes unto the hills; * from whence cometh my help?<br />
      2 My help cometh even from the LORD, * who hath made heaven and earth.<br />
      3 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved; * and he that keepeth thee will not sleep.<br />
      4 Behold, he that keepeth Israel * shall neither slumber nor sleep.<br />
      5 The LORD himself is thy keeper; * the LORD is thy defence upon thy right hand;<br />
      6 So that the sun shall not burn thee by day, * neither the moon by night.<br />
      7 The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil; * yea, it is even he that shall keep thy soul.<br />
      8 The LORD shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming in, * from this time forth for evermore.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 122. Laetatus sum.</strong><br />
      I WAS glad when they said unto me, * We will go into the house of the LORD.<br />
      2 Our feet shall stand in thy gates, * O Jerusalem.<br />
      3 Jerusalem is built as a city * that is at unity in itself.<br />
      4 For thither the tribes go up, even the tribes of the LORD, * to testify unto Israel, to give thanks unto the Name of the LORD.<br />
      5 For there is the seat of judgment, * even the seat of the house of David.<br />
      6 O pray for the peace of Jerusalem; * they shall prosper that love thee.<br />
      7 Peace be within thy walls, * and plenteousness within thy palaces.<br />
      8 For my brethren and companions' sakes, * I will wish thee prosperity.<br />
      9 Yea, because of the house of the LORD our God, * I will seek to do thee good.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 123. Ad te levavi oculos meos.</strong><br />
      UNTO thee lift I up mine eyes, * O thou that dwellest in the heavens.<br />
      2 Behold, even as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress, * even so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until he have mercy upon us.<br />
      3 Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us; * for we are utterly despised.<br />
      4 Our soul is filled with the scornful reproof of the wealthy, * and with the despitefulness of the proud.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 124. Nisi quia Dominus.</strong><br />
      IF the LORD himself had not been on our side, now may Israel say; * if the LORD himself had not been on our side, when men rose up against us;<br />
      2 They had swallowed us up alive; * when they were so wrathfully displeased at us.<br />
      3 Yea, the waters had drowned us, * and the stream had gone over our soul.<br />
      4 The deep waters of the proud * had gone even over our soul.<br />
      5 But praised be the LORD, * who hath not given us over for a prey unto their teeth.<br />
      6 Our soul is escaped even as a bird out of the snare of the fowler; * the snare is broken, and we are delivered.<br />
      7 Our help standeth in the Name of the LORD, * who hath made heaven and earth.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 125. Qui confidunt.</strong><br />
      THEY that put their trust in the LORD shall be even as the mount Sion, * which may not be removed, but standeth fast for ever.<br />
      2 The hills stand about Jerusalem; * even so standeth the LORD round about his people, from this time forth for evermore.<br />
      3 For the sceptre of the ungodly shall not abide upon the lot of the righteous; * lest the righteous put their hand unto wickedness.<br />
      4 Do well, O LORD, * unto those that are good and true of heart.<br />
    5 As for such as turn back unto their own wickedness, * the LORD shall lead them forth with the evil doers; but peace shall be upon Israel.
