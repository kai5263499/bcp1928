      <P><B>Psalm 79. Deus, venerunt.</B><BR>
      O GOD, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; * thy holy
      temple have they defiled, and made Jerusalem an heap of stones.<BR>
      2 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat
      unto the fowls of the air, * and the flesh of thy saints unto
      the beasts of the land.<BR>
      3 Their blood have they shed like water on every side of Jerusalem,
      * and there was no man to bury them.<BR>
      4 We are become an open shame to our enemies, * a very scorn
      and derision unto them that are round about us.<BR>
      5 LORD, how long wilt thou be angry? * shall thy jealousy burn
      like fire for ever?<BR>
      6 Pour out thine indignation upon the heathen that have not known
      thee; * and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy Name.<BR>
      7 For they have devoured Jacob, * and laid waste his dwelling-place.<BR>
      8 O remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and that
      soon; * for we are come to great misery.<BR>
      9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name:
      * O deliver us, and be merciful unto our sins, for thy Name's
      sake.<BR>
      10 Wherefore do the heathen say, * Where is now their God?<BR>
      11 O let the vengeance of thy servants' blood that is shed, *
      be openly showed upon the heathen, in our sight.<BR>
      12 O let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before thee;
      * according to the greatness of thy power, preserve thou those
      that are appointed to die.<BR>
      13 And for the blasphemy wherewith our neighbours have blasphemed
      thee, * reward thou them, O Lord, sevenfold into their bosom.<BR>
      14 So we, that are thy people, and sheep of thy pasture, shall
      give thee thanks for ever, * and will alway be showing forth
      thy praise from generation to generation.
