      <P><B>Psalms 36. Dixit injustus.</B><BR>
      MY heart showeth me the wickedness of the ungodly, * that there
      is no fear of God before his eyes.<BR>
      2 For he flattereth himself in his own sight, * until his abominable
      sin be found out.<BR>
      3 The words of his mouth are unrighteous and full of deceit:
      * he hath left off to behave himself wisely, and to do good.<BR>
      4 He imagineth mischief upon his bed, and hath set himself in
      no good way; * neither doth he abhor any thing that is evil.<BR>
      <A NAME="anchor1874161"></A>5 Thy mercy, O LORD, reacheth unto
      the heavens, * and thy faithfulness unto the clouds.<BR>
      6 Thy righteousness standeth like the strong mountains: * thy
      judgments are like the great deep.<BR>
      7 Thou, LORD, shalt save both man and beast: how excellent is
      thy mercy, O God! * and the children of men shall put their trust
      under the shadow of thy wings.<BR>
      8 They shall be satisfied with the plenteousness of thy house;
      * and thou shalt give them drink of thy pleasures, as out of
      the river.<BR>
      9 For with thee is the well of life; * and in thy light shall
      we see light.<BR>
      10 O continue forth thy loving-kindness unto them that know thee,
      * and thy righteousness unto them that are true of heart.<BR>
      11 O let not the foot of pride come against me; * and let not
      the hand of the ungodly cast me down.<BR>
      12 There are they fallen, all that work wickedness; * they are
      cast down, and shall not be able to stand.
