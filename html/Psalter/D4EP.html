    <p><strong>Psalm 22. Deus, Deus meus.</strong><br />
      MY God, my God, look upon me; why hast thou forsaken me? * and art so far from my health, and from the words of my complaint?<br />
      2 O my God, I cry in the day-time, but thou hearest not; * and in the night season also I take no rest.<br />
      3 And thou continuest holy, * O thou Worship of Israel.<br />
      4 Our fathers hoped in thee; * they trusted in thee, and thou didst deliver them.<br />
      5 They called upon thee, and were holpen; * they put their trust in thee, and were not confounded.<br />
      6 But as for me, I am a worm, and no man; * a very scorn of men, and the outcast of the people.<br />
      7 All they that see me laugh me to scorn; * they shoot out their lips, and shake their heads, saying,<br />
      8 He trusted in the LORD, that he would deliver him; * let him deliver him, if he will have him.<br />
      9 But thou art he that took me out of my mother's womb; * thou wast my hope, when I hanged yet upon my mother's breasts.<br />
      10 I have been left unto thee ever since I was born; * thou art my God even from my mother's womb.<br />
      11 O go not from me; for trouble is hard at hand, * and there is none to help me.<br />
      12 Many oxen are come about me; * fat bulls of Bashan close me in on every side.<br />
      13 They gape upon me with their mouths, * as it were a ramping and a roaring lion.<br />
      14 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint; * my heart also in the midst of my body is even like melting wax.<br />
      15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my<br />
      tongue cleaveth to my gums, * and thou bringest me into the dust of death.<br />
      16 For many dogs are come about me, * and the council of the wicked layeth siege against me.<br />
      17 They pierced my hands and my feet: I may tell all my bones: * they stand staring and looking upon me.<br />
      18 They part my garments among them, * and cast lots upon my vesture.<br />
      19 But be not thou far from me, O LORD; * thou art my succour, haste thee to help me.<br />
      20 Deliver my soul from the sword, * my darling from the power of the dog.<br />
      21 Save me from the lion's mouth; * thou hast heard me also from among the horns of the unicorns.<br />
      22 I will declare thy Name unto my brethren; * in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.<br />
      23 O praise the LORD, ye that fear him: * magnify him, all ye of the seed of Jacob; and fear him, all ye seed of Israel.<br />
      24 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the low estate of the poor; * he hath not hid his face from him; but when he called unto him he heard him.<br />
      25 My praise is of thee in the great-congregation; * my vows will I perform in the sight of them that fear him.<br />
      26 The poor shall eat, and be satisfied; they that seek after the LORD shall praise him: * your heart shall live for ever.<br />
      27 All the ends of the world shall remember themselves, and be turned unto the LORD; * and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before him.<br />
      28 For the kingdom is the LORD'S, * and he is the Governor among the nations.<br />
      29 All such as be fat upon earth * have eaten, and worshipped.<br />
      30 All they that go down into the dust shall kneel before him; * and no man hath quickened his own soul.<br />
      31 My seed shall serve him: * they shall be counted unto the Lord for a generation.<br />
      32 They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness * unto a people that shall be born, whom the Lord hath made.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 23. Dominus regit me.</strong><br />
      THE LORD is my shepherd; * therefore can I lack nothing.<br />
      2 He shall feed me in a green pasture, * and lead me forth beside the waters of comfort.<br />
      3 He shall convert my soul, * and bring me forth in the paths of righteousness for his Name's sake.<br />
      4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; * for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff comfort me.<br />
      5 Thou shalt prepare a table before me in the presence of them that trouble me; * thou hast anointed my head with oil, and my cup shall be full.<br />
    6 Surely thy loving-kindness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; * and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
