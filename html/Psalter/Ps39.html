      <P><B>Psalms 39. Dixi, Custodiam.</B><BR>
      I SAID, I will take heed to my ways, * that I offend not in my
      tongue<BR>
      2 I will keep my mouth as it were with a bridle, * while the
      ungodly is in my sight.<BR>
      3 I held my tongue, and spake nothing: * I kept silence, yea,
      even from good words; but it was pain and grief to me.<BR>
      4 My heart was hot within me: and while I was thus musing the
      fire kindled, * and at the last I spake with my tongue:<BR>
      5 LORD, let me know mine end, and the number of my days; * that
      I may be certified how long I have to live.<BR>
      6 Behold, thou hast made my days as it were a span long, and
      mine age is even as nothing in respect of thee; * and verily
      every man living is altogether vanity.<BR>
      7 For man walketh in a vain shadow, and disquieteth himself in
      vain; * he heapeth up riches, and cannot tell who shall gather
      them.<BR>
      8 And now, Lord, what is my hope? * truly my hope is even in
      thee.<BR>
      9 Deliver me from all mine offences; * and make me not a rebuke
      unto the foolish.<BR>
      10 I became dumb, and opened not my mouth; * for it was thy doing.<BR>
      11 Take thy plague away from me: * I am even consumed by the
      means of thy heavy hand.<BR>
      12 When thou with rebukes dost chasten man for sin, thou makest
      his beauty to consume away, like as it were a moth fretting a
      garment: * every man therefore is but vanity.<BR>
      13 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and with thine ears consider my calling;
      * hold not thy peace at my tears;<BR>
      14 For I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, * as all my
      fathers were.<BR>
      15 O spare me a little, that I may recover my strength, * before
      I go hence, and be no more seen.
