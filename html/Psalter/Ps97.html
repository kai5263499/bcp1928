      <P><B>Psalm 97. Dominus regnavit.</B><BR>
      THE LORD is King, the earth may be glad thereof; * yea, the multitude
      of the isles may be glad thereof.<BR>
      2 Clouds and darkness are round about him: * righteousness and
      judgment are the habitation of his seat.<BR>
      3 There shall go a fire before him, * and burn up his enemies
      on every side.<BR>
      4 His lightnings gave shine unto the world: * the earth saw it,
      and was afraid.<BR>
      5 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD; * at
      the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.<BR>
      6 The heavens have declared his righteousness, * and all the
      peoples have seen his glory.<BR>
      7 Confounded be all they that worship carved images, and that
      delight in vain gods: * worship him, all ye gods.<BR>
      8 Sion heard of it, and rejoiced; and the daughters of Judah
      were glad, * because of thy judgments, O LORD.<BR>
      9 For thou, LORD, art higher than all that are in the earth:
      * thou art exalted far above all gods.<BR>
      10 O ye that love the LORD, see that ye hate the thing which
      is evil: * the Lord preserveth the souls of his saints; he shall
      deliver them from the hand of the ungodly.<BR>
      11 There is sprung up a light for the righteous, * and joyful
      gladness for such as are true-hearted.<BR>
      12 Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; * and give thanks for a
      remembrance of his holiness.
