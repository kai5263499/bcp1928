    <p><strong>Psalm 114. In exitu Israel.</strong><br />
      WHEN Israel came out of Egypt, * and the house of Jacob from among the strange people,<br />
      2 Judah was his sanctuary, * and Israel his dominion.<br />
      3 The sea saw that, and fled; * Jordan was driven back.<br />
      4 The mountains skipped like rams, * and the little hills like young sheep.<br />
      5 What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? * and thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back?<br />
      6 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams? * and ye little hills, like young sheep?<br />
      7 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord: * at the presence of the God of Jacob;<br />
      8 Who turned the hard rock into a standing water, ': and the flint-stone into a springing well.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 115. Non nobis, Domine.</strong><br />
      NOT unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy Name give the praise; * for thy loving mercy, and for thy truth's sake.<br />
      2 Wherefore shall the heathen say, * Where is now their God?<br />
      3 As for our God, he is in heaven: * he hath done whatsoever pleased him.<br />
      4 Their idols are silver and gold, * even the work of men's hands.<br />
      5 They have mouths, and speak not; * eyes have they, and see not.<br />
      6 They have ears, and hear not; * noses have they, and smell not.<br />
      7 They have hands, and handle not; feet have they, and walk not; * neither speak they through their throat.<br />
      8 They that make them are like unto them; * and so are all such as put their trust in them.<br />
      9 But thou, house of Israel, trust thou in the LORD; * he is their helper and defender.<br />
      10 Ye house of Aaron, put your trust in the LORD; * he is their helper and defender.<br />
      11 Ye that fear the LORD, put your trust in the LORD; * he is their helper and defender.<br />
      12 The LORD hath been mindful of us, and he shall bless us; * even he shall bless the house of Israel, he shall bless the house of Aaron.<br />
      13 He shall bless them that fear the LORD, * both small and great.<br />
      14 The LORD shall increase you more and more, * you and your children.<br />
      15 Ye are the blessed of the LORD, * who made heaven and earth.<br />
      16 All the whole heavens are the LORD'S; * the earth hath he given to the children of men.<br />
      17 The dead praise not thee, O LORD, * neither all they that go down into silence.<br />
    18 But we will praise the LORD, * from this time forth for evermore. Praise the LORD.
