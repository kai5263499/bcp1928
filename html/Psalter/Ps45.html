      <P><B>Psalms 45. Eructavit cor meum.</B><BR>
      MY heart overfloweth with a good matter; I speak the things which
      I have made concerning the King. * My tongue is the pen of a
      ready writer.<BR>
      2 Thou art fairer than the children of men; * full of grace are
      thy lips, because God hath blessed thee for ever.<BR>
      3 Gird thee with thy sword upon thy thigh, O thou Most Mighty,
      * according to thy worship and renown.<BR>
      4 Good luck have thou with thine honour: * ride on, because of
      the word of truth, of meekness, and righteousness; and thy right
      hand shall teach thee terrible things.<BR>
      5 Thy arrows are very sharp in the heart of the King's enemies,
      * and the people shall be subdued unto thee.<BR>
      6 Thy seat, O God, endureth for ever; * the sceptre of thy kingdom
      is a right sceptre.<BR>
      7 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; * wherefore
      God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness
      above thy fellows.<BR>
      8 All thy garments smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia; * out of
      the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.<BR>
      9 Kings' daughters are among thy honourable women; * upon thy
      right hand doth stand the queen in a vesture of gold, wrought
      about with divers colours.<BR>
      10 Hearken, O daughter, and consider; incline thine ear; * forget
      also thine own people, and thy father's house.<BR>
      11 So shall the King have pleasure in thy beauty; * for he is
      thy Lord, and worship thou him.<BR>
      12 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; * like
      as the rich also among the people shall make their supplication
      before thee.<BR>
      13 The King's daughter is all glorious within; * her clothing
      is of wrought gold.<BR>
      14 She shall be brought unto the King in raiment of needlework:
      * the virgins that be her fellows shall bear her company, and
      shall be brought unto thee.<BR>
      15 With joy and gladness shall they be brought, * and shall enter
      into the King's palace.<BR>
      16 Instead of thy fathers, thou shalt have children, * whom thou
      mayest make princes in all lands.<BR>
      17 I will make thy Name to be remembered from one generation
      to another; * therefore shall the people give thanks unto thee,
      world without end.
