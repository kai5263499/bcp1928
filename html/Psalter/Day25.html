<BR>
      Morning Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P>V. Legem pone.<BR>
      TEACH me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes, * and I shall keep
      it unto the end.<BR>
      34 Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; * yea, I
      shall keep it with my whole heart.<BR>
      35 Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; * for therein
      is my desire.<BR>
      36 Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, * and not to covetousness.<BR>
      37 O turn away mine eyes, lest they behold vanity; * and quicken
      thou me in thy way.<BR>
      38 O stablish thy word in thy servant, * that I may fear thee.<BR>
      39 Take away the rebuke that I am afraid of; * for thy judgments
      are good.<BR>
      40 Behold, my delight is in thy commandments; * O quicken me
      in thy righteousness.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      VI. Et veniat super me.<BR>
      LET thy loving mercy come also unto me, O LORD, * even thy salvation,
      according unto thy word.<BR>
      42 So shall I make answer unto my blasphemers; * for my trust
      is in thy word.<BR>
      43 O take not the word of thy truth utterly out of my mouth;
      * for my hope is in thy judgments.<BR>
      44 So shall I alway keep thy law; * yea, for ever and ever.<BR>
      45 And I will walk at liberty; * for I seek thy commandments.<BR>
      46 I will speak of thy testimonies also, even before kings, *
      and will not be ashamed.<BR>
      47 And my delight shall be in thy commandments, * which I have
      loved.<BR>
      48 My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which
      I have loved; * and my study shall be in thy statutes.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      VII. Memor esto verbi tui.<BR>
      O THINK upon thy servant, as concerning thy word, * wherein thou
      hast caused me to put my trust.<BR>
      50 The same is my comfort in my trouble; * for thy word hath
      quickened me.<BR>
      51 The proud have had me exceedingly in derision; * yet have
      I not shrinked from thy law.<BR>
      52 For I remembered thine everlasting judgments, O LORD, * and
      received comfort.<BR>
      53 I am horribly afraid, * for the ungodly that forsake thy law.<BR>
      54 Thy statutes have been my songs, * in the house of my pilgrimage.<BR>
      55 I have thought upon thy Name, O LORD, in the night season,
      * and have kept thy law.<BR>
      56 This I had, * because I kept thy commandments.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      VIII. Portio mea, Domine.<BR>
      THOU art my portion, O LORD; * I have promised to keep thy law.<BR>
      58 I made my humble petition in thy presence with my whole heart;
      * O be merciful unto me, according to thy word.<BR>
      59 I called mine own ways to remembrance, * and turned my feet
      unto thy testimonies.<BR>
      60 I made haste, and prolonged not the time, * to keep thy commandments.<BR>
      61 The snares of the ungodly have compassed me about; * but I
      have not forgotten thy law.<BR>
      62 At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee, * because
      of thy righteous judgments.<BR>
      63 I am a companion of all them that fear thee, * and keep thy
      commandments.<BR>
      64 The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: * O teach me thy
      statutes.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      IX. Bonitatem fecisti.<BR>
      O LORD, thou hast dealt graciously with thy servant, * according
      unto thy word.<BR>
      66 O teach me true understanding and knowledge; * for I have
      believed thy commandments.<BR>
      67 Before I was troubled, I went wrong; * but now have I kept
      thy word.<BR>
      68 Thou art good and gracious; * O teach me thy statutes.<BR>
      69 The proud have imagined a lie against me; * but I will keep
      thy commandments with my whole heart.<BR>
      70 Their heart is as fat as brawn; * but my delight hath been
      in thy law.<BR>
      71 It is good for me that I have been in trouble; * that I may
      learn thy statutes.<BR>
      72 The law of thy mouth is dearer unto me * than thousands of
      gold and silver.<BR>
      </P>

      <P><CENTER><A NAME="anchor470275"></A>Evening Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P>X. Manus tuae fecerunt me.<BR>
      THY hands have made me and fashioned me: * O give me understanding,
      that I may learn thy commandments.<BR>
      74 They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; * because
      I have put my trust in thy word.<BR>
      75 I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, * and that thou
      of very faithfulness hast caused me to be troubled.<BR>
      76 O let thy merciful kindness be my comfort, * according to
      thy word unto thy servant.<BR>
      77 O let thy loving mercies come unto me, that I may live; *
      for thy law is my delight.<BR>
      78 Let the proud be confounded, for they go wickedly about to
      destroy me; * but I will be occupied in thy commandments.<BR>
      79 Let such as fear thee, and have known thy testimonies, * be
      turned unto me.<BR>
      80 O let my heart be sound in thy statutes, * that I be not ashamed.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      XI. Defecit anima mea.<BR>
      MY soul hath longed for thy salvation, * and I have a good hope
      because of thy word.<BR>
      82 Mine eyes-long sore for thy word; * saying, O when wilt thou
      comfort me?<BR>
      83 For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; * yet do I not
      forget thy statutes.<BR>
      84 How many are the days of thy servant? * when wilt thou be
      avenged of them that persecute me?<BR>
      85 The proud have digged pits for me, * which are not after thy
      law.<BR>
      86 All thy commandments are true: * they persecute me falsely;
      O be thou my help.<BR>
      87 They had almost made an end of me upon earth; * but I forsook
      not thy commandments.<BR>
      88 O quicken me after thy loving-kindness; * and so shall I keep
      the testimonies of thy mouth.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      XII. In aeternum, Domine.<BR>
      O LORD, thy word * endureth for ever in heaven. go Thy truth
      also remaineth from one generation to another; * thou hast laid
      the foundation of the earth, and it abideth.<BR>
      91 They continue this day according to thine ordinance; * for
      all things serve thee.<BR>
      92 If my delight had not been in thy law, * I should have perished
      in my trouble.<BR>
      93 I will never forget thy commandments; * for with them thou
      hast quickened me.<BR>
      94 I am thine: O save me, * for I have sought thy commandments.<BR>
      95 The ungodly laid wait for me, to destroy me; * but I will
      consider thy testimonies.<BR>
      96 I see that all things come to an end; * but thy commandment
      is exceeding broad.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      XIII. Quomodo dilexi!<BR>
      LORD, what love have I unto thy law! * all the day long is my
      study in it.<BR>
      98 Thou, through thy commandments, hast made me wiser than mine
      enemies; * for they are ever with me.<BR>
      99 I have more understanding than my teachers; * for thy testimonies
      are my study.<BR>
      100 I am wiser than the aged; * because I keep thy commandments.<BR>
      101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, * that I may
      keep thy word.<BR>
      102 I have not shrunk from thy judgments; * for thou teachest
      me.<BR>
      103 O how sweet are thy words unto my throat; * yea, sweeter
      than honey unto my mouth!<BR>
      104 Through thy commandments I get understanding: * therefore
      I hate all evil ways.<BR>
