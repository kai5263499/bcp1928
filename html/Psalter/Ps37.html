      <P><B>Psalms 37. Noli aemulari.</B><BR>
      FRET not thyself because of the ungodly; * neither be thou envious
      against the evil doers.<BR>
      2 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, * and be withered
      even as the green herb.<BR>
      3 Put thou thy trust in the LORD, and be doing good; * dwell
      in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.<BR>
      4 Delight thou in the LORD, * and he shall give thee thy heart's
      desire.<BR>
      5 Commit thy way unto the LORD, and put thy trust in him, * and
      he shall bring it to pass.<BR>
      6 He shall make thy righteousness as clear as the light, * and
      thy just dealing as the noon-day.<BR>
      7 Hold thee still in the LORD, and abide patiently upon him:
      * but grieve not thyself at him whose way doth prosper, against
      the man that doeth after evil counsels.<BR>
      8 Leave off from wrath, and let go displeasure: * fret not thyself,
      else shalt thou be moved to do evil.<BR>
      9 Wicked doers shall be rooted out; * and they that patiently
      abide the LORD, those shall inherit the land.<BR>
      10 Yet a little while, and the ungodly shall be clean gone: *
      thou shalt look after his place, and he shall be away.<BR>
      11 But the meek-spirited shall possess the earth, * and shall
      be refreshed in the multitude of peace.<BR>
      12 The ungodly seeketh counsel against the just, * and gnasheth
      upon him with his teeth.<BR>
      13 The Lord shall laugh him to-scorn; * for he hath seen that
      his day is coming.<BR>
      14 The ungodly have drawn out the sword, and have bent their
      bow, * to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be
      upright in their ways.<BR>
      15 Their sword shall go through their own heart, * and their
      bow shall be broken.<BR>
      16 A small thing that the righteous hath, * is better than great
      riches of the ungodly.<BR>
      17 For the arms of the ungodly shall be broken, * and the LORD
      upholdeth the righteous.<BR>
      18 The LORD knoweth the days of the godly; * and their inheritance
      shall endure for ever.<BR>
      19 They shall not be confounded in the perilous time; * and in
      the days of dearth they shall have enough.<BR>
      20 As for the ungodly, they shall perish, and the enemies of
      the LORD shall consume as the fat of lambs: * yea, even as the
      smoke shall they consume away.<BR>
      21 The ungodly borroweth, and payeth not again; * but the righteous
      is merciful and liberal.<BR>
      22 Such as are blessed of God, shall possess the land; * and
      they that are cursed of him, shall be rooted out.<BR>
      23 The LORD ordereth a good man's going, * and maketh his way
      acceptable to himself.<BR>
      24 Though he fall, he shall not be cast away; * for the LORD
      upholdeth him with his hand.<BR>
      25 I have been young, and now am old; * and yet saw I never the
      righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging their bread.<BR>
      <A NAME="anchor441818"></A>26 The righteous is ever merciful,
      and lendeth; * and his seed is blessed.<BR>
      27 Flee from evil, and do the thing that is good; * and dwell
      for evermore.<BR>
      28 For the LORD loveth the thing that is right; * he forsaketh
      not his that be godly, but they are preserved for ever.<BR>
      29 The unrighteous shall be punished; * as for the seed of the
      ungodly, it shall be rooted out.<BR>
      30 The righteous shall inherit the land, * and dwell therein
      for ever.<BR>
      31 The mouth of the righteous is exercised in wisdom, * and his
      tongue will be talking of judgment.<BR>
      32 The law of his God is in his heart, * and his goings shall
      not slide.<BR>
      33 The ungodly watcheth the righteous, * and seeketh occasion
      to slay him.<BR>
      34 The LORD will not leave him in his hand, * nor condemn him
      when he is judged.<BR>
      35 Hope thou in the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall promote
      thee, that thou shalt possess the land: * when the ungodly shall
      perish, thou shalt see it.<BR>
      36 I myself have seen the ungodly in great power, * and flourishing
      like a green bay-tree.<BR>
      37 I went by, and lo, he was gone: * I sought him, but his place
      could no where be found.<BR>
      38 Keep innocency, and take heed unto the thing that is right;
      * for that shall bring a man peace at the last.<BR>
      39 As for the transgressors, they shall perish together; * and
      the end of the ungodly is, they shall be rooted out at the last.<BR>
      40 But the salvation of the righteous cometh of the LORD; * who
      is also their strength in the time of trouble.<BR>
      41 And the LORD shall stand by them, and save them: * he shall
      deliver them from the ungodly, and shall save them, because they
      put their trust in him.
