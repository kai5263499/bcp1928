      <P><B>Psalm 146. Lauda, anima mea.</B><BR>
      PRAISE the LORD, O my soul: while I live, will I praise the LORD;
      * yea, as long as I have any being, I will sing praises unto
      my God.<BR>
      2 O put not your trust in princes, nor in any child of man; *
      for there is no help in them.<BR>
      3 For when the breath of man goeth forth, he shall turn again
      to his earth, * and then all his thoughts perish.<BR>
      4 Blessed is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, * and
      whose hope is in the LORD his God:<BR>
      5 Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that therein is;
      * who keepeth his promise for ever;<BR>
      6 Who helpeth them to right that suffer wrong; * who feedeth
      the hungry.<BR>
      7 The LORD looseth men out of prison; * the LORD giveth sight
      to the blind.<BR>
      8 The LORD helpeth them that are fallen; * the LORD careth for
      the righteous.<BR>
      9 The LORD careth for the strangers; he defendeth the fatherless
      and widow: * as for the way of the ungodly, he turneth it upside
      down.<BR>
      10 The LORD thy God, O Sion, shall be King for evermore, * and
      throughout all generations.
