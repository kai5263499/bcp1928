      <P><B>Psalms 38. Domine, ne in furore.</B><BR>
      PUT me not to rebuke, O LORD, in thine anger; * neither chasten
      me in thy heavy displeasure:<BR>
      2 For thine arrows stick fast in me, * and thy hand presseth
      me sore.<BR>
      3 There is no health in my flesh, because of thy displeasure;
      * neither is there any rest in my bones, by reason of my sin.<BR>
      4 For my wickednesses are gone over my head, * and are like a
      sore burden, too heavy for me to bear.<BR>
      5 My wounds stink, and are corrupt, * through my foolishness.<BR>
      6 I am brought into so great trouble and misery, * that I go
      mourning all the day long.<BR>
      7 For my loins are filled with a sore disease, * and there is
      no whole part in my body.<BR>
      8 I am feeble and sore smitten; * I have roared for the very
      disquietness of my heart.<BR>
      9 Lord, thou knowest all my desire; * and my groaning is not
      hid from thee.<BR>
      10 My heart panteth, my strength hath failed me, * and the light
      of mine eyes is gone from me.<BR>
      11 My lovers and my neighbours did stand looking upon my trouble,
      * and my kinsmen stood afar off.<BR>
      12 They also that sought after my life laid snares for me; *
      and they that went about to do me evil talked of wickedness,
      and imagined deceit all the day long.<BR>
      13 As for me, I was like a deaf man, and heard not; * and as
      one that is dumb, who doth not open his mouth.<BR>
      14 I became even as a man that heareth not, * and in whose mouth
      are no reproofs.<BR>
      15 For in thee, O LORD, have I put my trust; * thou shalt answer
      for me, O Lord my God.<BR>
      16 I have required that they, even mine enemies, should not triumph
      over me; * for when my foot slipt, they rejoiced greatly against
      me.<BR>
      17 And I truly am set in the plague, * and my heaviness is ever
      in my sight.<BR>
      18 For I will confess my wickedness, * and be sorry for my sin.<BR>
      19 But mine enemies live, and are mighty; * and they that hate
      me wrongfully are many in number.<BR>
      20 They also that reward evil for good are against me; * because
      I follow the thing that good is.<BR>
      21 Forsake me not, O LORD my God; * be not thou far from me.
