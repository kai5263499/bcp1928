      <P><B>Psalm 83. Deus, quis similis?</B><BR>
      HOLD not thy tongue, O God, keep not still silence: * refrain
      not thyself, O God.<BR>
      2 For lo, thine enemies make a murmuring; * and they that hate
      thee have lift up their head.<BR>
      3 They have imagined craftily against thy people, * and taken
      counsel against thy secret ones.<BR>
      4 They have said, Come, and let us root them out, that they be
      no more a people, * and that the name of Israel may be no more
      in remembrance.<BR>
      5 For they have cast their heads together with one consent, *
      and are confederate against thee:<BR>
      6 The tabernacles of the Edomites, and the Ishmaelites; * the
      Moabites, and Hagarenes;<BR>
      7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; * the Philistines, with them
      that dwell at Tyre.<BR>
      8 Assyria also is joined with them; * they have holpen the children
      of Lot.<BR>
      9 But do thou to them as unto the Midianites; * unto Sisera,
      and unto Jabin at the brook of Kishon;<BR>
      10 Who perished at Endor, * and became as the dung of the earth.<BR>
      11 Make them and their princes like Oreb and Zeeb; * yea, make
      all their princes like as Zebah and Zalmunna;<BR>
      12 Who say, Let us take to ourselves * the houses of God in possession.<BR>
      13 O my God, make them like unto the whirling dust, * and as
      the stubble before the wind;<BR>
      14 Like as the fire that burneth up the forest, * and as the
      flame that consumeth the mountains;<BR>
      15 Pursue them even so with thy tempest, * and make them afraid
      with thy storm.<BR>
      16 Make their faces ashamed, O LORD, * that they may seek thy
      Name.<BR>
      17 Let them be confounded and vexed ever more and more; * let
      them be put to shame, and perish.<BR>
      18 And they shall know that thou, whose Name is JEHOVAH, * art
      only the Most Highest over all the earth.
