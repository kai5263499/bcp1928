      <P><B>Psalm 92. Bonum est confiteri.</B><BR>
      IT is a good thing to give thanks unto the LORD, * and to sing
      praises unto thy Name, O Most Highest;<BR>
      2 To tell of thy loving-kindness early in the morning, * and
      of thy truth in the night season;<BR>
      3 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the lute; * upon
      a loud instrument, and upon the harp.<BR>
      4 For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy works; * and
      I will rejoice in giving praise for the operations of thy hands.<BR>
      5 O LORD, how glorious are thy works! * thy thoughts are very
      deep.<BR>
      6 An unwise man doth not well consider this, * and a fool doth
      not understand it.<BR>
      7 When the ungodly are green as the grass, and when all the workers
      of wickedness do flourish, * then shall they be destroyed for
      ever; but thou, LORD, art the Most Highest for evermore.<BR>
      8 For lo, thine enemies, O LORD, lo, thine enemies shall perish;
      * and all the workers of wickedness shall be destroyed.<BR>
      9 But my horn shall be exalted like the horn of an unicorn; *
      for I am anointed with fresh oil.<BR>
      10 Mine eye also shall see his lust of mine enemies, * and mine
      ear shall hear his desire of the wicked that arise up against
      me.<BR>
      11 The righteous shall flourish like a palm-tree, * and shall
      spread abroad like a cedar in Lebanon.<BR>
      12 Such as are planted in the house of the LORD, * shall flourish
      in the courts of the house of our God.<BR>
      13 They also shall bring forth more fruit in their age, * and
      shall be fat and well-liking;<BR>
      14 That they may show how true the LORD my strength is, * and
      that there is no unrighteousness in him.
