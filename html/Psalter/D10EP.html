    <p><strong>Psalm 53. Dixit insipiens.</strong><br />
      THE foolish body hath said in his heart, * There is no God.<br />
      2 Corrupt are they, and become abominable in their wickedness; * there is none that doeth good.<br />
      3 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, * to see if there were any that would understand, and seek after God.<br />
      4 But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become abominable; * there is also none that doeth good, no not one.<br />
      5 Are not they without understanding that work wickedness, * eating up my people as if they would eat bread? they have not called upon God.<br />
      6 They were afraid where no fear was; * for God hath broken the bones of him that besieged thee; thou hast put them to confusion, because God hath despised them.<br />
      7 O that the salvation were given unto Israel out of Sion! * O that the Lord would deliver his people out of captivity!<br />
      8 Then should Jacob rejoice, * and Israel should be right glad.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 54. Deus, in Nomine.</strong><br />
      SAVE me, O God, for thy Name's sake, * and avenge me in thy strength.<br />
      2 Hear my prayer, O God, * and hearken unto the words of my mouth.<br />
      3 For strangers are risen up against me; * and tyrants, which have not God before their eyes, seek after my soul.<br />
      4 Behold, God is my helper; * the Lord is with them that uphold my soul.<br />
      5 He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: * destroy thou them in thy truth.<br />
      6 An offering of a free heart will I give thee, and praise thy Name, O LORD; * because it is so comfortable.<br />
      7 For he hath delivered me out of all my trouble; * and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 55. Exaudi, Deus.</strong><br />
      HEAR my prayer, O God, * and hide not thyself from my petition.<br />
      2 Take heed unto me, and hear me, * how I mourn in my prayer, and am vexed;<br />
      3 The enemy crieth so, and the ungodly cometh on so fast; * for they are minded to do me some mischief, so maliciously are they set against me.<br />
      4 My heart is disquieted within me, * and the fear of death is fallen upon me.<br />
      5 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, * and an horrible dread hath overwhelmed me.<br />
      6 And I said, O that I had wings like a dove! * for then would I flee away, and be at rest.<br />
      7 Lo, then would I get me away far off, * and remain in the wilderness.<br />
      8 I would make haste to escape, * because of the stormy wind and tempest.<br />
      9 Destroy their tongues, O Lord, and divide them; * for I have spied unrighteousness and strife in the city.<br />
      10 Day and night they go about within the walls thereof: * mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.<br />
      11 Wickedness is therein; * deceit and guile go not out of her streets.<br />
      12 For it is not an open enemy that hath done me this dishonour; * for then I could have borne it;<br />
      13 Neither was it mine adversary that did magnify himself against me; * for then peradventure I would have hid myself from him;<br />
      14 But it was even thou, my companion, * my guide, and mine own familiar friend.<br />
      15 We took sweet counsel together, * and walked in the house of God as friends.<br />
      16 Let death come hastily upon them, and let them go down alive into the pit; * for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.<br />
      17 As for me, I will call upon God, * and the LORD shall save me.<br />
      18 In the evening, and morning, and at noon-day will I pray, and that instantly; * and he shall hear my voice.<br />
      19 It is he that hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me; * for there were many that strove with me.<br />
      20 Yea, even God, that endureth for ever, shall hear me, and bring them down; * for they will not turn, nor fear God.<br />
      21 He laid his hands upon such as be at peace with him, * and he brake his covenant.<br />
      22 The words of his mouth were softer than butter, having war in his heart; * his words were smoother than oil, and yet be they very swords.<br />
      23 O cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall nourish thee, * and shall not suffer the righteous to fall for ever.<br />
      24 And as for them, * thou, O God, shalt bring them into the pit of destruction.<br />
    25 The blood-thirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days: * nevertheless, my trust shall be in thee, O Lord.
