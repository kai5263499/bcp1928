      <P><B>Psalm 59. Eripe me de inimicis.</B><BR>
      DELIVER me from mine enemies, O God; * defend me from them that
      rise up against me.<BR>
      2 O deliver me from the wicked doers, * and save me from the
      blood-thirsty men.<BR>
      3 For lo, they lie waiting for my soul; * the mighty men are
      gathered against me, without any offence or fault of me, O LORD.<BR>
      4 They run and prepare themselves without my fault; * arise thou
      therefore to help me, and behold.<BR>
      5 Stand up, O LORD God of hosts, thou God of Israel, to visit
      all the heathen, * and be not merciful unto them that offend
      of malicious wickedness.<BR>
      6 They go to and fro in the evening, * they grin like a dog,
      and run about through the city.<BR>
      7 Behold, they speak with their mouth, and swords are in their
      lips; * for who doth hear?<BR>
      8 But thou, O LORD, shalt have them in derision, * and thou shalt
      laugh all the heathen to scorn.<BR>
      9 My strength will I ascribe unto thee; * for thou art the God
      of my refuge.<BR>
      10 God showeth me his goodness plenteously; * and God shall let
      me see my desire upon mine enemies.<BR>
      11 Slay them not, lest my people forget it; * but scatter them
      abroad among the people, and put them down, O Lord our defence.<BR>
      12 For the sin of their mouth, and for the words of their lips,
      they shall be taken in their pride: * and why? their talk is
      of cursing and lies.<BR>
      13 Consume them in thy wrath, consume them, that they may perish;
      * and know that it is God that ruleth in Jacob, and unto the
      ends of the world.<BR>
      14 And in the evening they will return, * grin like a dog, and
      will go about the city.<BR>
      15 They will run here and there for meat, * and grudge if they
      be not satisfied.<BR>
      16 As for me, I will sing of thy power, and will praise thy mercy
      betimes in the morning; * for thou hast been my defence and refuge
      in the day of my trouble.<BR>
      17 Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing; * for thou, O God,
      art my refuge, and my merciful God.
