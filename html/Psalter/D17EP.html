    <p><strong>Psalm 89. Misericordias Domini.</strong><br />
      MY song shall be alway of the loving-kindness of the LORD; * with my mouth will I ever be showing thy truth from one generation to another.<br />
      2 For I have said, Mercy shall be set up for ever; * thy truth shalt thou stablish in the heavens.<br />
      3 I have made a covenant with my chosen; * I have sworn unto David my servant:<br />
      4 Thy seed will I stablish for ever, * and set up thy throne from one generation to another.<br />
      5 O LORD, the very heavens shall praise thy wondrous works; * and thy truth in the congregation of the saints.<br />
      6 For who is he among the clouds, * that shall be compared unto the LORD?<br />
      7 And what is he among the gods, * that shall be like unto the LORD?<br />
      8 God is very greatly to be feared in the council of the saints, * and to be had in reverence of all them that are round about him.<br />
      9 O Lord God of hosts, who is like unto thee? * thy truth, most mighty LORD, is on every side.<br />
      10 Thou rulest the raging of the sea; * thou stillest the waves thereof when they arise.<br />
      11 Thou hast subdued Egypt, and destroyed it; * thou hast scattered thine enemies abroad with thy mighty arm.<br />
      12 The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine; * thou hast laid the foundation of the round world, and all that therein is.<br />
      13 Thou hast made the north and the south; * Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy Name.<br />
      14 Thou hast a mighty arm; * strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.<br />
      15 Righteousness and equity are the habitation of thy seat; * mercy and truth shall go before thy face.<br />
      16 Blessed is the people, O LORD, that can rejoice in thee; * they shall walk in the light of thy countenance.<br />
      17 Their delight shall be daily in thy Name; * and in thy righteousness shall they make their boast.<br />
      18 For thou art the glory of their strength, * and in thy loving-kindness thou shalt lift up our horns.<br />
      19 For the LORD is our defence; * the Holy One of Israel is our King.<br />
      20 Thou spakest sometime in visions unto thy saints, and saidst, * I have laid help upon one that is mighty, I have exalted one chosen out of the people.<br />
      21 I have found David my servant; * with my holy oil have I anointed him.<br />
      22 My hand shall hold him fast, * and my arm shall strengthen him.<br />
      23 The enemy shall not be able to do him violence; * the son of wickedness shall not hurt him.<br />
      24 I will smite down his foes before his face, * and plague them that hate him.<br />
      25 My truth also and my mercy shall be with him; * and in my Name shall his horn be exalted.<br />
      26 I will set his dominion also in the sea, * and his right hand in the floods.<br />
      27 He shall call me, Thou art my Father, * my God, and my strong salvation.<br />
      28 And I will make him my firstborn, * higher than the kings of the earth.<br />
      29 My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, * and my covenant shall stand fast with him.<br />
      30 His seed also will I make to endure for ever, * and his throne as the days of heaven.<br />
      31 But if his children forsake my law, * and walk not in my judgments;<br />
      32 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; * I will visit their offences with the rod, and their sin with scourges.<br />
      33 Nevertheless, my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from him, * nor suffer my truth to fail.<br />
      34 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips: * I have sworn once by my holiness, that I will not fail David.<br />
      35 His seed shall endure for ever, * and his throne is like as the sun before me.<br />
      36 He shall stand fast for evermore as the moon, * and as the faithful witness in heaven.<br />
      37 But thou hast abhorred and forsaken thine anointed, * and art displeased at him.<br />
      38 Thou hast broken the covenant of thy servant, * and cast his crown to the ground.<br />
      39 Thou hast overthrown all his hedges, * and broken down his strongholds.<br />
      40 All they that go by spoil him, * and he is become a reproach to his neighbours.<br />
      41 Thou hast set up the right hand of his enemies, * and made all his adversaries to rejoice.<br />
      42 Thou hast taken away the edge of his sword, * and givest him not victory in the battle.<br />
      43 Thou hast put out his glory, * and cast his throne down to the ground.<br />
      44 The days of his youth hast thou shortened, * and covered him with dishonour.<br />
      45 LORD, how long wilt thou hide thyself? for ever? * and shall thy wrath burn like fire?<br />
      46 O remember how short my time is; * wherefore hast thou made all men for nought?<br />
      47 What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? * and shall he deliver his soul from the power of the grave?<br />
      48 Lord, where are thy old loving-kindnesses, * which thou swarest unto David in thy truth?<br />
      49 Remember, Lord, the rebuke that thy servants have, * and how I do bear in my bosom the rebukes of many people;<br />
      50 Wherewith thine enemies have blasphemed thee, * and slandered the footsteps of thine anointed.<br />
      51 Praised be the LORD for evermore. * Amen, and Amen. </p>
