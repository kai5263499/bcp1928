      <P><B>Psalm 111. Confitebor tibi.</B><BR>
      I WILL give thanks unto the LORD with my whole heart, * secretly
      among the faithful, and in the congregation.<BR>
      2 The works of the LORD are great, * sought out of all them that
      have pleasure therein.<BR>
      3 His work is worthy to be praised and had in honour, * and his
      righteousness endureth for ever.<BR>
      4 The merciful and gracious LORD hath so done his marvellous
      works, * that they ought to be had in remembrance.<BR>
      5 He hath given meat unto them that fear him; * he shall ever
      be mindful of his covenant.<BR>
      6 He hath showed his people the power of his works, * that he
      may give them the heritage of the heathen.<BR>
      7 The works of his hands are verity and judgment; * all his commandments
      are true.<BR>
      8 They stand fast for ever and ever, * and are done in truth
      and equity.<BR>
      9 He sent redemption unto his people; * he hath commanded his
      covenant for ever; holy and reverend is his Name.<BR>
      10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; * a good
      understanding have all they that do thereafter; his praise endureth
      for ever.
