    <p><strong>Psalm 71. In te, Domine, speravi.</strong><br />
      IN thee, O LORD, have I put my trust; let me never be put to confusion, * but rid me and deliver me in thy righteousness; incline thine ear unto me, and save me.<br />
      2 Be thou my stronghold, whereunto I may alway resort: * thou hast promised to help me, for thou art my house of defence, and my castle.<br />
      3 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the ungodly, * out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.<br />
      4 For thou, O Lord GOD, art the thing that I long for: * thou art my hope, even from my youth.<br />
      5 Through thee have I been holden up ever since I was born: * thou art he that took me out of my mother's womb: my praise shall be alway of thee.<br />
      6 I am become as it were a monster unto many, * but my sure trust is in thee.<br />
      7 O let my mouth be filled with thy praise, * that I may sing of thy glory and honour all the day long.<br />
      8 Cast me not away in the time of age; * forsake me not when my strength faileth me.<br />
      9 For mine enemies speak against me; * and they that lay wait for my soul take their counsel together, saying,<br />
      10 God hath forsaken him; * persecute him, and take him, for there is none to deliver him.<br />
      11 Go not far from me, O God; * my God, haste thee to help me.<br />
      12 Let them be confounded and perish that are against my soul; * let them be covered with shame and dishonour that seek to do me evil.<br />
      13 As for me, I will patiently abide alway, * and will praise thee more and more.<br />
      14 My mouth shall daily speak of thy righteousness and salvation; * for I know no end thereof.<br />
      15 I will go forth in the strength of the Lord GOD, * and will make mention of thy righteousness only.<br />
      16 Thou, O God, hast taught me from my youth up until now; * therefore will I tell of thy wondrous works.<br />
      17 Forsake me not, O God, in mine old age, when I am gray-headed, * until I have showed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to all them that are yet for to come.<br />
      18 Thy righteousness, O God, is very high, * and great things are they that thou hast done: O God, who is like unto thee!<br />
      19 O what great troubles and adversities hast thou showed me ! and yet didst thou turn and refresh me; * yea, and broughtest me from the deep of the earth again.<br />
      20 Thou hast brought me to great honour, * and comforted me on every side:<br />
      21 Therefore will I praise thee, and thy faithfulness, O God, playing upon an instrument of music: * unto thee will I sing upon the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.<br />
      22 My lips will be glad when I sing unto thee; * and so will my soul whom thou hast delivered.<br />
      23 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long; * for they are confounded and brought unto shame that seek to do me evil.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 72. Deus, judicium.</strong><br />
      GIVE the King thy judgments, O God, * and thy righteousness unto the King's son.<br />
      2 Then shall he judge thy people according unto right, * and defend the poor.<br />
      3 The mountains also shall bring peace, * and the little hills righteousness unto the people.<br />
      4 He shall keep the simple folk by their right, * defend the children of the poor, and punish the wrong doer.<br />
      5 They shall fear thee, as long as the sun and moon endureth, * from one generation to another.<br />
      6 He shall come down like the rain upon the mown grass, * even as the drops that water the earth.<br />
      7 In his time shall the righteous flourish; * yea, and abundance of peace, so long as the moon endureth.<br />
      8 His dominion shall be also from the one sea to the other, * and from the River unto the world's end.<br />
      9 They that dwell in the wilderness shall kneel before him; * his enemies shall lick the dust.<br />
      10 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall give presents; * the kings of Arabia and Saba shall bring gifts.<br />
      11 All kings shall fall down before him; * all nations shall do him service.<br />
      12 For he shall deliver the poor when he crieth; * the needy also, and him that hath no helper.<br />
      13 He shall be favourable to the simple and needy, * and shall preserve the souls of the poor.<br />
      14 He shall deliver their souls from falsehood and wrong; * and dear shall their blood be in his sight.<br />
      15 He shall live, and unto him shall be given of the gold of Arabia; * prayer shall be made ever unto him, and daily shall he be praised.<br />
      16 There shall be an heap of corn in the earth, high upon the hills ; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: * and they of the city shall flourish like grass upon the earth.<br />
      17 His Name shall endure for ever; his Name shall remain under the sun among the posterities, which shall be blessed in him; * and all the nations shall praise him.<br />
      18 Blessed be the LORD God, even the God of Israel, * which only doeth wondrous things;<br />
    19 And blessed be the Name of his majesty for ever: * and all the earth shall be filled with his majesty. Amen, Amen.
