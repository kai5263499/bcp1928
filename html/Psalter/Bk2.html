Quemadmodum.</B><BR />LIKE as the hart desireth the water-brooks, * so longeth my soul
after thee, O God.<BR />2 My soul is athirst for God, yea, even for the living God: *
when shall I come to appear before the presence of God?<BR />3 My tears have been my meat day and night, * while they daily
say unto me, Where is now thy God?<BR />4 Now when I think thereupon, I pour out my heart by myself; *
for I went with the multitude, and brought them forth into the
house of God;<BR />5 In the voice of praise and thanksgiving, * among such as keep
holy-day.<BR />6 Why art thou so full of heaviness, O my soul? * and why art
thou so disquieted within me?<BR />7 O put thy trust in God; * for I will yet thank him, which is
the help of my countenance, and my God.<BR />8 My soul is vexed within me; * therefore will I remember thee
from the land of Jordan, from Hermon and the little hill.<BR />9 One deep calleth another, because of the noise of thy water-floods;
* all thy waves and storms are gone over me.<BR />10 The LORD will grant his loving-kindness in the daytime; * and
in the night season will I sing of him, and make my prayer unto
the God of my life.<BR />11 I will say unto the God of my strength, Why hast thou forgotten
me? * why go I thus heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?<BR />12 My bones are smitten asunder as with a sword, * while mine
enemies that trouble me cast me in the teeth;<BR />13 Namely, while they say daily unto me, * Where is now thy God?<BR />14 Why art thou so vexed, O my soul? * and why art thou so disquieted
within me?<BR />15 O put thy trust in God; * for I will yet thank him, which is
the help of my countenance, and my God.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 43. Judica me, Deus.</B><BR />GIVE sentence with me, O God, and defend my cause against the
ungodly people; * O deliver me from the deceitful and wicked man.<BR />2 For thou art the God of my strength; why hast thou put me from
thee? * and why go I so heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?<BR />3 O send out thy light and thy truth, that they may lead me, *
and bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy dwelling;<BR />4 And that I may go unto the altar of God, even unto the God of
my joy and gladness; * and upon the harp will I give thanks unto
thee, O God, my God.<BR />5 Why art thou so heavy, O my soul? * and why art thou so disquieted
within me?<BR />6 O put thy trust in God; * for I will yet give him thanks, which
is the help of my countenance, and my God.<BR /></p><P><CENTER>The Ninth Day.<BR /><BR />Morning Prayer.</CENTER></p><P><B>Psalm 44. Deus, auribus.</B><BR />WE have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us *
what thou hast done in their time of old:<BR />2 How thou hast driven out the heathen with thy hand, and planted
our fathers in; * how thou hast destroyed the nations, and made
thy people to flourish.<BR />3 For they gat not the land in possession through their own sword,
* neither was it their own arm that helped them;<BR />4 But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance;
* because thou hadst a favour unto them.<BR />5 Thou art my King, O God; * send help unto Jacob.<BR />6 Through thee will we overthrow our enemies, * and in thy Name
will we tread them under that rise up against us.<BR />7 For I will not trust in my bow, * it is not my sword that shall
help me;<BR />8 But it is thou that savest us from our enemies, * and puttest
them to confusion that hate us.<BR />9 We make our boast of God all day long, * and will praise thy
Name for ever.<BR />10 But now thou art far off, and puttest us to confusion, * and
goest not forth with our armies.<BR />11 Thou makest us to turn our backs upon our enemies, * so that
they which hate us spoil our goods.<BR />12 Thou lettest us be eaten up like sheep, * and hast scattered
us among the heathen.<BR />13 Thou sellest thy people for nought, * and takest no money for
them.<BR />14 Thou makest us to be rebuked of our neighbours, * to be laughed
to scorn, and had in derision of them that are round about us.<BR />15 Thou makest us to be a by-word among the nations, * and that
the peoples shake their heads at us.<BR />16 My confusion is daily before me, * and the shame of my face
hath covered me;<BR />17 For the voice of the slanderer and blasphemer, * for the enemy
and avenger.<BR />18 And though all this be come upon us, yet do we not forget thee,
* nor behave ourselves frowardly in thy covenant.<BR />19 Our heart is not turned back, * neither our steps gone out
of thy way;<BR />20 No, not when thou hast smitten us into the place of dragons,
* and covered us with the shadow of death.<BR />21 If we have forgotten the Name of our God, and holden up our
hands to any strange god, * shall not God search it out? for he
knoweth the very secrets of the heart.<BR />22 For thy sake also are we killed all the day long, * and are
counted as sheep appointed to be slain.<BR />23 Up, Lord, why sleepest thou? * awake, and be not absent from
us for ever.<BR />24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, * and forgettest our misery
and trouble?<BR />25 For our soul is brought low, even unto the dust; * our belly
cleaveth unto the ground.<BR />26 Arise, and help us, * and deliver us, for thy mercy's sake.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 45. Eructavit cor meum.</B><BR />MY heart overfloweth with a good matter; I speak the things which
I have made concerning the King. * My tongue is the pen of a ready
writer.<BR />2 Thou art fairer than the children of men; * full of grace are
thy lips, because God hath blessed thee for ever.<BR />3 Gird thee with thy sword upon thy thigh, O thou Most Mighty,
* according to thy worship and renown.<BR />4 Good luck have thou with thine honour: * ride on, because of
the word of truth, of meekness, and righteousness; and thy right
hand shall teach thee terrible things.<BR />5 Thy arrows are very sharp in the heart of the King's enemies,
* and the people shall be subdued unto thee.<BR />6 Thy seat, O God, endureth for ever; * the sceptre of thy kingdom
is a right sceptre.<BR />7 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; * wherefore
God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness
above thy fellows.<BR />8 All thy garments smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia; * out of
the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.<BR />9 Kings' daughters are among thy honourable women; * upon thy
right hand doth stand the queen in a vesture of gold, wrought
about with divers colours.<BR />10 Hearken, O daughter, and consider; incline thine ear; * forget
also thine own people, and thy father's house.<BR />11 So shall the King have pleasure in thy beauty; * for he is
thy Lord, and worship thou him.<BR />12 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; * like
as the rich also among the people shall make their supplication
before thee.<BR />13 The King's daughter is all glorious within; * her clothing
is of wrought gold.<BR />14 She shall be brought unto the King in raiment of needlework:
* the virgins that be her fellows shall bear her company, and
shall be brought unto thee.<BR />15 With joy and gladness shall they be brought, * and shall enter
into the King's palace.<BR />16 Instead of thy fathers, thou shalt have children, * whom thou
mayest make princes in all lands.<BR />17 I will make thy Name to be remembered from one generation to
another; * therefore shall the people give thanks unto thee, world
without end.<BR /><B><BR /><BR />Psalm 46. Deus noster refugium.</B><BR />GOD is our hope and strength, * a very present help in trouble.<BR />2 Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be moved, * and
though the hills be carried into the midst of the sea;<BR />3 Though the waters thereof rage and swell, * and though the mountains
shake at the tempest of the same.<BR />4 There is a river, the streams whereof make glad the city of
God; * the holy place of the tabernacle of the Most Highest.<BR />5 God is in the midst of her, therefore shall she not be removed;
* God shall help her, and that right early.<BR />6 The nations make much ado, and the kingdoms are moved; * but
God hath showed his voice, and the earth shall melt away.<BR />7 The LORD of hosts is with us; * the God of Jacob is our refuge.<BR />8 O come hither, and behold the works of the LORD, * what destruction
he hath brought upon the earth.<BR />9 He maketh wars to cease in all the world; * he breaketh the
bow, and knappeth the spear in sunder, and burneth the chariots
in the fire.<BR />10 Be still then, and know that I am God: * I will be exalted
among the nations, and I will be exalted in the earth.<BR />11 The LORD of hosts is with us; * the God of Jacob is our refuge.<BR /></p><P><CENTER>Evening Prayer.</CENTER></p><P><B>Psalm 47. Omnes gentes, plaudite.</B><BR />CLAP your hands together, all ye peoples: * O sing unto God with
the voice of melody.<BR />2 For the LORD is high, and to be feared; * he is the great King
upon all the earth.<BR />3 He shall subdue the peoples under us, * and the nations under
our feet.<BR />4 He shall choose out an heritage for us, * even the excellency
of Jacob, whom he loved.<BR />5 God is gone up with a merry noise, * and the LORD with the sound
of the trump.<BR />6 O sing praises, sing praises unto our God; * O sing praises,
sing praises unto our King.<BR />7 For God is the King of all the earth: * sing ye praises with
understanding.<BR />8 God reigneth over the nations; * God sitteth upon his holy seat.<BR />9 The princes of the peoples are joined unto the people of the
God of Abraham; * for God, which is very high exalted, doth defend
the earth, as it were with a shield.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 48. Magnus Dominus.</B><BR />GREAT is the LORD, and highly to be praised * in the city of our
God, even upon his holy hill.<BR />2 The hill of Sion is a fair place, and the joy of the whole earth;
* upon the north side lieth the city of the great King: God is
well known in her palaces as a sure refuge.<BR />3 For lo, the kings of the earth * were gathered, and gone by
together.<BR />4 They marvelled to see such things; * they were astonished, and
suddenly cast down.<BR />5 Fear came there upon them; and sorrow, * as upon a woman in
her travail.<BR />6 Thou dost break the ships of the sea * through the east-wind.<BR />7 Like as we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD
of hosts, in the city of our God; * God upholdeth the same for
ever.<BR />8 We wait for thy loving-kindness, O God, * in the midst of thy
temple.<BR />9 O God, according to thy Name, so is thy praise unto the world's
end; * thy right hand is full of righteousness.<BR />10 Let the mount Sion rejoice, and the daughters of Judah be glad,
* because of thy judgments.<BR />11 Walk about Sion, and go round about her; * and tell the towers
thereof.<BR />12 Mark well her bulwarks, consider her palaces, * that ye may
tell them that come after.<BR />13 For this God is our God for ever and ever: * he shall be our
guide unto death.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 49. Audite haec, omnes.</B><BR />O HEAR ye this, all ye people; * ponder it with your ears, all
ye that dwell in the world;<BR />2 High and low, rich and poor, * one with another.<BR />3 My mouth shall speak of wisdom, * and my heart shall muse of
understanding.<BR />4 I will incline mine ear to the parable, * and show my dark speech
upon the harp.<BR />5 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, * when wickedness
at my heels compasseth me round about?<BR />6 There be some that put their trust in their goods, * and boast
themselves in the multitude of their riches.<BR />7 But no man may deliver his brother, * nor give a ransom unto
God for him,<BR />8 (For it cost more to redeem their souls, * so that he must let
that alone for ever;)<BR />9 That he shall live alway, * and not see the grave.<BR />10 For he seeth that wise men also die and perish together, *
as well as the ignorant and foolish, and leave their riches for
other.<BR />11 And yet they think that their houses shall continue for ever,
and that their dwelling-places shall endure from one generation
to another; * and call the lands after their own names.<BR />12 Nevertheless, man being in honour abideth not, * seeing he
may be compared unto the beasts that perish;<BR />13 This their way is very foolishness; * yet their posterity praise
their saying.<BR />14 They lie in the grave like sheep; death is their shepherd;
and the righteous shall have dominion over them in the morning:
* their beauty shall consume in the sepulchre, and have no abiding.<BR />15 But God hath delivered my soul from the power of the grave;
* for he shall receive me.<BR />16 Be not thou afraid, though one be made rich, * or if the glory
of his house be increased;<BR />17 For he shall carry nothing away with him when he dieth, * neither
shall his pomp follow him.<BR />18 For while he lived, he counted himself an happy man; * and
so long as thou doest well unto thyself, men will speak good of
thee.<BR />19 He shall follow the generation of his fathers, * and shall
never see light.<BR />20 Man that is in honour but hath no understanding * is compared
unto the beasts that perish.<BR /></p><P><CENTER>The Tenth Day.<BR /><BR />Morning Prayer.</CENTER></p><P><B>Psalm 50. Deus deorum.</B><BR />THE LORD, even the Most Mighty God, hath spoken, * and called
the world, from the rising up of the sun unto the going down thereof.<BR />2 Out of Sion hath God appeared * in perfect beauty.<BR />3 Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence; * there shall
go before him a consuming fire, and a mighty tempest shall be
stirred up round about him.<BR />4 He shall call the heaven from above, * and the earth, that he
may judge his people.<BR />5 Gather my saints together unto me; * those that have made a
covenant with me with sacrifice.<BR />6 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness; * for God is
Judge himself.<BR />7 Hear, O my people, and I will speak; * I myself will testify
against thee, O Israel; for I am God, even thy God.<BR />8 I will not reprove thee because of thy sacrifices; * as for
thy burnt-offerings, they are alway before me.<BR />9 I will take no bullock out of thine house, * nor he-goats out
of thy folds.<BR />10 For all the beasts of the forest are mine, * and so are the
cattle upon a thousand hills.<BR />11 I know all the fowls upon the mountains, * and the wild beasts
of the field are in my sight.<BR />12 If I be hungry, I will not tell thee; * for the whole world
is mine, and all that is therein.<BR />13 Thinkest thou that I will eat bulls' flesh, * and drink the
blood of goats?<BR />14 Offer unto God thanksgiving, * and pay thy vows unto the Most
Highest.<BR />15 And call upon me in the time of trouble; * so will I hear thee,
and thou shalt praise me.<BR />16 But unto the ungodly saith God, * Why dost thou preach my laws,
and takest my covenant in thy mouth;<BR />17 Whereas thou hatest to be reformed, * and hast cast my words
behind thee?<BR />18 When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst unto him; * and
hast been partaker with the adulterers.<BR />19 Thou hast let thy mouth speak wickedness, * and with thy tongue
thou hast set forth deceit.<BR />20 Thou sattest and spakest against thy brother; * yea, and hast
slandered thine own mother's son.<BR />21 These things hast thou done, and I held my tongue, and thou
thoughtest wickedly, that I am even such a one as thyself; * but
I will reprove thee, and set before thee the things that thou
hast done.<BR />22 O consider this, ye that forget God, * lest I pluck you away,
and there be none to deliver you.<BR />23 Whoso offereth me thanks and praise, he honoureth me; * and
to him that ordereth his way aright, will I show the salvation
of God.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 51. Miserere mei, Deus.</B><BR />HAVE mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness; * according
to the multitude of thy mercies do away mine offences.<BR />2 Wash me throughly from my wickedness, * and cleanse me from
my sin.<BR />3 For I acknowledge my faults, * and my sin is ever before me.<BR />4 Against thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight;
* that thou mightest be justified in thy saying, and clear when
thou shalt judge.<BR />5 Behold, I was shapen in wickedness, * and in sin hath my mother
conceived me.<BR />6 But lo, thou requirest truth in the inward parts, * and shalt
make me to understand wisdom secretly.<BR />7 Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; * thou
shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.<BR />8 Thou shalt make me hear of joy and gladness, * that the bones
which thou hast broken may rejoice.<BR />9 Turn thy face from my sins, * and put out all my misdeeds.<BR />10 Make me a clean heart, O God, * and renew a right spirit within
me.<BR />11 Cast me not away from thy presence, * and take not thy holy
Spirit from me.<BR />12 O give me the comfort of thy help again, * and stablish me
with thy free Spirit.<BR />13 Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked, * and sinners
shall be converted unto thee.<BR />14 Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou that art the
God of my health; * and my tongue shall sing of thy righteousness.<BR />15 Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord, * and my mouth shall show
thy praise.<BR />16 For thou desirest no sacrifice, else would I give it thee;
* but thou delightest not in burnt-offerings.<BR />17 The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit: * a broken and contrite
heart, O God, shalt thou not despise.<BR />18 O be favourable and gracious unto Sion; * build thou the walls
of Jerusalem.<BR />19 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness,
with the burnt-offerings and oblations; * then shall they offer
young bullocks upon thine altar.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 52. Quid gloriaris?</B><BR />WHY boastest thou thyself, thou tyrant, * that thou canst do mischief;<BR />2 Whereas the goodness of God * endureth yet daily?<BR />3 Thy tongue imagineth wickedness, * and with lies thou cuttest
like a sharp razor.<BR />4 Thou hast loved unrighteousness more than goodness, * and falsehood
more than righteousness.<BR />5 Thou hast loved to speak all words that may do hurt, * O thou
false tongue.<BR />6 Therefore shall God destroy thee for ever; * he shall take thee,
and pluck thee out of thy dwelling, and root thee out of the land
of the living.<BR />7 The righteous also shall see this, and fear, * and shall laugh
him to scorn:<BR />8 Lo, this is the man that took not God for his strength; * but
trusted unto the multitude of his riches, and strengthened himself
in his wickedness.<BR />9 As for me, I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God;
* my trust is in the tender mercy of God for ever and ever.<BR />10 I will alway give thanks unto thee for that thou hast done;
* and I will hope in thy Name, for thy saints like it well.<BR /></p><P><CENTER>Evening Prayer.</CENTER></p><P><B>Psalm 53. Dixit insipiens.</B><BR />THE foolish body hath said in his heart, * There is no God.<BR />2 Corrupt are they, and become abominable in their wickedness;
* there is none that doeth good.<BR />3 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, * to see
if there were any that would understand, and seek after God.<BR />4 But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become
abominable; * there is also none that doeth good, no not one.<BR />5 Are not they without understanding that work wickedness, * eating
up my people as if they would eat bread? they have not called
upon God.<BR />6 They were afraid where no fear was; * for God hath broken the
bones of him that besieged thee; thou hast put them to confusion,
because God hath despised them.<BR />7 O that the salvation were given unto Israel out of Sion! * O
that the Lord would deliver his people out of captivity!<BR />8 Then should Jacob rejoice, * and Israel should be right glad.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 54. Deus, in Nomine.</B><BR />SAVE me, O God, for thy Name's sake, * and avenge me in thy strength.<BR />2 Hear my prayer, O God, * and hearken unto the words of my mouth.<BR />3 For strangers are risen up against me; * and tyrants, which
have not God before their eyes, seek after my soul.<BR />4 Behold, God is my helper; * the Lord is with them that uphold
my soul.<BR />5 He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: * destroy thou them
in thy truth.<BR />6 An offering of a free heart will I give thee, and praise thy
Name, O LORD; * because it is so comfortable.<BR />7 For he hath delivered me out of all my trouble; * and mine eye
hath seen his desire upon mine enemies.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 55. Exaudi, Deus.</B><BR />HEAR my prayer, O God, * and hide not thyself from my petition.<BR />2 Take heed unto me, and hear me, * how I mourn in my prayer,
and am vexed;<BR />3 The enemy crieth so, and the ungodly cometh on so fast; * for
they are minded to do me some mischief, so maliciously are they
set against me.<BR />4 My heart is disquieted within me, * and the fear of death is
fallen upon me.<BR />5 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, * and an horrible
dread hath overwhelmed me.<BR />6 And I said, O that I had wings like a dove! * for then would
I flee away, and be at rest.<BR />7 Lo, then would I get me away far off, * and remain in the wilderness.<BR />8 I would make haste to escape, * because of the stormy wind and
tempest.<BR />9 Destroy their tongues, O Lord, and divide them; * for I have
spied unrighteousness and strife in the city.<BR />10 Day and night they go about within the walls thereof: * mischief
also and sorrow are in the midst of it.<BR />11 Wickedness is therein; * deceit and guile go not out of her
streets.<BR />12 For it is not an open enemy that hath done me this dishonour;
* for then I could have borne it;<BR />13 Neither was it mine adversary that did magnify himself against
me; * for then peradventure I would have hid myself from him;<BR />14 But it was even thou, my companion, * my guide, and mine own
familiar friend.<BR />15 We took sweet counsel together, * and walked in the house of
God as friends.<BR />16 Let death come hastily upon them, and let them go down alive
into the pit; * for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among
them.<BR />17 As for me, I will call upon God, * and the LORD shall save
me.<BR />18 In the evening, and morning, and at noon-day will I pray, and
that instantly; * and he shall hear my voice.<BR />19 It is he that hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle
that was against me; * for there were many that strove with me.<BR />20 Yea, even God, that endureth for ever, shall hear me, and bring
them down; * for they will not turn, nor fear God.<BR />21 He laid his hands upon such as be at peace with him, * and
he brake his covenant.<BR />22 The words of his mouth were softer than butter, having war
in his heart; * his words were smoother than oil, and yet be they
very swords.<BR />23 O cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall nourish thee,
* and shall not suffer the righteous to fall for ever.<BR />24 And as for them, * thou, O God, shalt bring them into the pit
of destruction.<BR />25 The blood-thirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half
their days: * nevertheless, my trust shall be in thee, O Lord.<BR /></p><P><CENTER>The Eleventh Day.<BR /><BR />Morning Prayer.</CENTER></p><P><B>Psalm 56. Miserere mei, Deus.</B><BR />BE merciful unto me, O God, for man goeth about to devour me;

shall perform the cause which I have in hand.<BR />3 He shall send from heaven, * and save me from the reproof of
him that would eat me up.<BR />4 God shall send forth his mercy and truth: * my soul is among
lions;<BR />5 And I lie even among the children of men, that are set on fire,
* whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp
sword.<BR />6 Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens; * and thy glory above

do ye judge the thing that is right, O ye sons of men?<BR />2 Yea, ye imagine mischief in your heart upon the earth, * and
your hands deal with wickedness.<BR />3 The ungodly are froward, even from their mother's womb; * as
soon as they are born, they go astray, and speak lies.<BR />4 They are as venomous as the poison of a serpent, * even like
the deaf adder, that stoppeth her ears;<BR />5 Which refuseth to hear the voice of the charmer, * charm he
never so wisely.<BR />6 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouths; * smite the jaw-bones

shoot their arrows, let them be rooted out.<BR />8 Let them consume away like a snail, and be like the untimely
fruit of a woman; * and let them not see the sun.<BR />9 Or ever your pots be made hot with thorns, * he shall take them
away with a whirlwind, the green and the burning alike.<BR />10 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance; *

my refuge, and my merciful God.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 60. Deus, repulisti nos.</B><BR />O GOD, thou hast cast us out, and scattered us abroad; * thou
hast also been displeased: O turn thee unto us again.<BR />2 Thou hast moved the land, and divided it: * heal the sores thereof,
for it shaketh.<BR />3 Thou hast showed thy people heavy things; * thou hast given
us a drink of deadly wine.<BR />4 Thou hast given a token for such as fear thee, * that they may
triumph because of the truth.<BR />5 Therefore were thy beloved delivered; * help me with thy right
hand, and hear me.<BR />6 God hath spoken in his holiness, I will rejoice, and divide
Shechem, * and mete out the valley of Succoth.<BR />7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; * Ephraim also is the
strength of my head; Judah is my law-giver;<BR />8 Moab is my wash-pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; * Philistia,
be thou glad of me.<BR />9 Who will lead me into the strong city? * who will bring me into
Edom?<BR />10 Hast not thou cast us out, O God? * wilt not thou, O God, go
out with our hosts?<BR />11 O be thou our help in trouble; * for vain is the help of man.<BR />12 Through God will we do great acts; * for it is he that shall
tread down our enemies.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 61. Exaudi, Deus.</B><BR />HEAR my crying, O God, * give ear unto my prayer.<BR />2 From the ends of the earth will I call upon thee, * when my
heart is in heaviness.<BR />3 O set me up upon the rock that is higher than I; * for thou
hast been my hope, and a strong tower for me against the enemy.<BR />4 I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever, * and my trust shall
be under the covering of thy wings.<BR />5 For thou, O Lord, hast heard my desires, * and hast given an
heritage unto those that fear thy Name.<BR />6 Thou shalt grant the King a long life, * that his years may
endure throughout all generations.<BR />7 He shall dwell before God for ever: * O prepare thy loving mercy

perform my vows.<BR /></p><P><CENTER>The Twelfth Day.<BR /><BR />Morning Prayer.</CENTER></p><P><B>Psalm 62. Nonne Deo?</B><BR />MY soul truly waiteth still upon God; * for of him cometh my salvation.<BR />2 He verily is my strength and my salvation; * he is my defence,
so that I shall not greatly fall.<BR />3 How long will ye imagine mischief against every man? * Ye shall
be slain all the sort of you; yea, as a tottering wall shall ye
be, and like a broken hedge.<BR />4 Their device is only how to put him out whom God will exalt;
* their delight is in lies; they give good words with their mouth,
but curse with their heart.<BR />5 Nevertheless, my soul, wait thou still upon God; * for my hope
is in him.<BR />6 He truly is my strength and my salvation; * he is my defence,
so that I shall not fall.<BR />7 In God is my health and my glory; * the rock of my might; and
in God is my trust.<BR />8 O put your trust in him alway, ye people; * pour out your hearts
before him, for God is our hope.<BR />9 As for the children of men, they are but vanity; the children
of men are deceitful; * upon the weights they are altogether lighter
than vanity itself.<BR />10 O trust not in wrong and robbery; give not yourselves unto
vanity: * if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.<BR />11 God spake once, and twice I have also heard the same, * that
power belongeth unto God;<BR />12 And that thou, Lord, art merciful; * for thou rewardest every
man according to his work.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 63. Deus, Deus meus.</B><BR />O GOD, thou art my God; * early will I seek thee.<BR />2 My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh also longeth after thee,
* in a barren and dry land where no water is.<BR />3 Thus have I looked for thee in the sanctuary, * that I might
behold thy power and glory.<BR />4 For thy loving-kindness is better than the life itself: * my
lips shall praise thee.<BR />5 As long as I live will I magnify thee in this manner, * and
lift up my hands in thy Name.<BR />6 My soul shall be satisfied, even as it were with marrow and
fatness, * when my mouth praiseth thee with joyful lips.<BR />7 Have I not remembered thee in my bed, * and thought upon thee
when I was waking?<BR />8 Because thou hast been my helper; * therefore under the shadow
of thy wings will I rejoice.<BR />9 My soul hangeth upon thee; * thy right hand hath upholden me.<BR />10 These also that seek the hurt of my soul, * they shall go under
the earth.<BR />11 Let them fall upon the edge of the sword, * that they may be
a portion for foxes.<BR />12 But the King shall rejoice in God; all they also that swear
by him shall be commended; * for the mouth of them that speak
lies shall be stopped.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 64. Exaudi, Deus.</B><BR />HEAR my voice, O God, in my prayer; * preserve my life from fear
of the enemy.<BR />2 Hide me from the gathering together of the froward, * and from
the insurrection of wicked doers;<BR />3 Who have whet their tongue like a sword, * and shoot out their
arrows, even bitter words;<BR />4 That they may privily shoot at him that is perfect: * suddenly
do they hit him, and fear not.<BR />5 They encourage themselves in mischief, * and commune among themselves,
how they may lay snares; and say, that no man shall see them.<BR />6 They imagine wickedness, and practise it; * that they keep secret
among themselves, every man in the deep of his heart.<BR />7 But God shall suddenly shoot at them with a swift arrow, * that
they shall be wounded.<BR />8 Yea, their own tongues shall make them fall; * insomuch that
whoso seeth them shall laugh them to scorn.<BR />9 And all men that see it shall say, This hath God done; * for
they shall perceive that it is his work.<BR />10 The righteous shall rejoice in the LORD, and put his trust
in him; * and all they that are true of heart shall be glad.<BR /></p><P><CENTER>Evening Prayer.</CENTER></p><P><B>Psalm 65. Te decet hymnus.</B><BR />THOU, O God, art praised in Sion; * and unto thee shall the vow

sins.<BR />4 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and receivest unto thee:
* he shall dwell in thy court, and shall be satisfied with the
pleasures of thy house, even of thy holy temple.<BR />5 Thou shalt show us wonderful things in thy righteousness, O
God of our salvation; * thou that art the hope of all the ends

about with power.<BR />7 Who stilleth the raging of the sea, * and the noise of his waves,
and the madness of the peoples.<BR />8 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts of the earth shall
be afraid at thy tokens, * thou that makest the out-goings of
the morning and evening to praise thee.<BR />9 Thou visitest the earth, and blessest it; * thou makest it very
plenteous.<BR />10 The river of God is full of water: * thou preparest their corn,
for so thou providest for the earth.<BR />11 Thou waterest her furrows; thou sendest rain into the little
valleys thereof; * thou makest it soft with the drops of rain,
and blessest the increase of it.<BR />12 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; * and thy clouds
drop fatness.<BR />13 They shall drop upon the dwellings of the wilderness; * and
the little hills shall rejoice on every side.<BR />14 The folds shall be full of sheep; * the valleys also shall
stand so thick with corn, that they shall laugh and sing.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 66. Jubilate Deo.</B><BR />O BE joyful in God, all ye lands; * sing praises unto the honour
of his Name; make his praise to be glorious.<BR />2 Say unto God, O how wonderful art thou in thy works! * through
the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies bow down unto thee.<BR />3 For all the world shall worship thee, * sing of thee, and praise
thy Name.<BR />4 O come hither, and behold the works of God; * how wonderful
he is in his doing toward the children of men.<BR />5 He turned the sea into dry land, * so that they went through
the water on foot; there did we rejoice thereof.<BR />6 He ruleth with his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations:
* and such as will not believe shall not be able to exalt themselves.<BR />7 O praise our God, ye peoples, * and make the voice of his praise
to be heard;<BR />8 Who holdeth our soul in life; * and suffereth not our feet to
slip.<BR />9 For thou, O God, hast proved us; * thou also hast tried us,
like as silver is tried.<BR />10 Thou broughtest us into the snare; * and laidest trouble upon
our loins.<BR />11 Thou sufferedst men to ride over our heads; * we went through
fire and water, and thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.<BR />12 I will go into thine house with burnt-offerings, and will pay
thee my vows, * which I promised with my lips, and spake with
my mouth, when I was in trouble.<BR />13 I will offer unto thee fat burnt-sacrifices, with the incense
of rams; * I will offer bullocks and goats.<BR />14 O come hither, and hearken, all ye that fear God; * and I will
tell you what he hath done for my soul.<BR />15 I called unto him with my mouth, * and gave him praises with
my tongue.<BR />16 If I incline unto wickedness with mine heart, * the Lord will
not hear me.<BR />17 But God hath heard me; * and considered the voice of my prayer.<BR />18 Praised be God, who hath not cast out my prayer, * nor turned
his mercy from me.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 67. Deus misereatur.</B><BR />GOD be merciful unto us, and bless us, * and show us the light
of his countenance, and be merciful unto us;<BR />2 That thy way may be known upon earth, * thy saving health among
all nations.<BR />3 Let the peoples praise thee, O God; * yea, let all the peoples
praise thee.<BR />4 O let the nations rejoice and be glad; * for thou shalt judge
the folk righteously, and govern the nations upon earth.<BR />5 Let the peoples praise thee, O God; * yea, let all the peoples
praise thee.<BR />6 Then shall the earth bring forth her increase; * and God, even

him.<BR /></p><P><CENTER>The Thirteenth Day.<BR /><BR />Morning Prayer.</CENTER></p><P><B>Psalm 68. Exsurgat Deus.</B><BR />LET God arise, and let his enemies be scattered; * let them also
that hate him flee before him.<BR />2 Like as the smoke vanisheth, so shalt thou drive them away;
* and like as wax melteth at the fire, so let the ungodly perish
at the presence of God.<BR />3 But let the righteous be glad, and rejoice before God; * let
them also be merry and joyful.<BR />4 O sing unto God, and sing praises unto his Name; magnify him
that rideth upon the heavens; * praise him in his Name JAH, and
rejoice before him.<BR />5 He is a Father of the fatherless, and defendeth the cause of
the widows; * even God in his holy habitation.<BR />6 He is the God that maketh men to be of one mind in an house,
and bringeth the prisoners out of captivity; * but letteth the
runagates continue in scarceness.<BR />7 O God, when thou wentest forth before the people; * when thou
wentest through the wilderness,<BR />8 The earth shook, and the heavens dropped at the presence of
God; * even as Sinai also was moved at the presence of God, who
is the God of Israel.<BR />9 Thou, O God, sentest a gracious rain upon thine inheritance,
* and refreshedst it when it was weary.<BR />10 Thy congregation shall dwell therein; * for thou, O God, hast
of thy goodness prepared for the poor.<BR />11 The Lord gave the word; * great was the company of women that
bare the tidings.<BR />12 Kings with their armies did flee, and were discomfited, * and
they of the household divided the spoil.<BR />13 Though ye have lain among the sheep-folds, yet shall ye be
as the wings of a dove * that is covered with silver wings, and
her feathers like gold.<BR />14 When the Almighty scattered kings for their sake, * then were
they as white as snow in Salmon.<BR />15 As the hill of Bashan, so is God's hill; * even an high hill,
as the hill of Bashan.<BR />16 Why mock ye so, ye high hills? this is God's hill, in the which
it pleaseth him to dwell; * yea, the LORD will abide in it for
ever.<BR />17 The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of
angels; * and the Lord is among them as in the holy place of Sinai.<BR />18 Thou art gone up on high, thou hast led captivity captive,
and received gifts from men; * yea, even from thine enemies, that
the LORD God might dwell among them.<BR />19 Praised be the Lord daily, * even the God who helpeth us, and
poureth his benefits upon us.<BR />20 He is our God, even the God of whom cometh salvation: * GOD
is the Lord, by whom we escape death.<BR />21 God shall wound the head of his enemies, * and the hairy scalp
of such a one as goeth on still in his wickedness.<BR />22 The Lord hath said, I will bring my people again, as I did
from Bashan; * mine own will I bring again, as I did sometime
from the deep of the sea.<BR />23 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies,
* and that the tongue of thy dogs may be red through the same.<BR />24 It is well seen, O God, how thou goest; * how thou, my God
and King, goest in the sanctuary.<BR />25 The singers go before, the minstrels follow after, * in the
midst of the damsels playing with the timbrels.<BR />26 Give thanks unto God the Lord in the congregation, * ye that
are of the fountain of Israel.<BR />27 There is little Benjamin their ruler, and the princes of Judah
their council; * the princes of Zebulon, and the princes of Naphthali.<BR />28 Thy God hath sent forth strength for thee; * stablish the thing,
O God, that thou hast wrought in us,<BR />29 For thy temple's sake at Jerusalem; * so shall kings bring
presents unto thee.<BR />30 Rebuke thou the dragon and the bull, with the leaders of the
heathen, so that they humbly bring pieces of silver; * scatter
thou the peoples that delight in war;<BR />31 Then shall the princes come out of Egypt; * the Morians' land
shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.<BR />32 Sing unto God, O ye kingdoms of the earth; * O sing praises
unto the Lord;<BR />33 Who sitteth in the heavens over all, from the beginning: *
lo, he doth send out his voice; yea, and that a mighty voice.<BR />34 Ascribe ye the power to God over Israel; * his worship and
strength is in the clouds.<BR />35 O God, wonderful art thou in thy holy places: * even the God
of Israel, he will give strength and power unto his people. Blessed

into deep waters, so that the floods run over me.<BR />3 I am weary of crying; my throat is dry; * my sight faileth me
for waiting so long upon my God.<BR />4 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of
my head; * they that are mine enemies, and would destroy me guiltless,
are mighty.<BR />5 I paid them the things that I never took: * God, thou knowest
my simpleness, and my faults are not hid from thee.<BR />6 Let not them that trust in thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed
for my cause; * let not those that seek thee be confounded through
me, O Lord God of Israel.<BR />7 And why? for thy sake have I suffered reproof; * shame hath
covered my face.<BR />8 I am become a stranger unto my brethren, * even an alien unto
my mother's children.<BR />9 For the zeal of thine house hath even eaten me; * and the rebukes
of them that rebuked thee are fallen upon me.<BR />10 I wept, and chastened myself with fasting, * and that was turned
to my reproof.<BR />11 I put on sackcloth also, * and they jested upon me.<BR />12 They that sit in the gate speak against me, * and the drunkards
make songs upon me.<BR />13 But, LORD, I make my prayer unto thee * in an acceptable time.<BR />14 Hear me, O God, in the multitude of thy mercy, * even in the
truth of thy salvation.<BR />15 Take me out of the mire, that I sink not; * O let me be delivered
from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.<BR />16 Let not the water-flood drown me, neither let the deep swallow
me up; * and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.<BR />17 Hear me, O LORD, for thy loving-kindness is comfortable; *
turn thee unto me according to the multitude of thy mercies.<BR />18 And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble:
* O haste thee, and hear me.<BR />19 Draw nigh unto my soul, and save it; * O deliver me, because
of mine enemies.<BR />20 Thou hast known my reproach, my shame, and my dishonour: *
mine adversaries are all in thy sight.<BR />21 Reproach hath broken my heart; I am full of heaviness: * I
looked for some to have pity on me, but there was no man, neither
found I any to comfort me.<BR />22 They gave me gall to eat; * and when I was thirsty they gave
me vinegar to drink.<BR />23 Let their table be made a snare to take themselves withal;
* and let the things that should have been for their wealth be
unto them an occasion of falling.<BR />24 Let their eyes be blinded, that they see not; * and ever bow
thou down their backs.<BR />25 Pour out thine indignation upon them, * and let thy wrathful
displeasure take hold of them.<BR />26 Let their habitation be void, * and no man to dwell in their
tents.<BR />27 For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; * and they talk
how they may vex them whom thou hast wounded.<BR />28 Let them fall from one wickedness to another, * and not come
into thy righteousness.<BR />29 Let them be wiped out of the book of the living, * and not
be written among the righteous.<BR />30 As for me, when I am poor and in heaviness, * thy help, O God,
shall lift me up.<BR />31 I will praise the Name of God with a song, * and magnify it
with thanksgiving.<BR />32 This also shall please the LORD * better than a bullock that
hath horns and hoofs.<BR />33 The humble shall consider this, and be glad: * seek ye after
God, and your soul shall live.<BR />34 For the LORD heareth the poor, * and despiseth not his prisoners.<BR />35 Let heaven and earth praise him: * the sea, and all that moveth
therein.<BR />36 For God will save Sion, and build the cities of Judah, * that
men may dwell there, and have it in possession.<BR />37 The posterity also of his servants shall inherit it; * and
they that love his Name shall dwell therein.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 70. Deus, in adjutorium.</B><BR />HASTE thee, O God, to deliver me; * make haste to help me, O LORD.<BR />2 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul;

make mention of thy righteousness only.<BR />16 Thou, O God, hast taught me from my youth up until now; * therefore
will I tell of thy wondrous works.<BR />17 Forsake me not, O God, in mine old age, when I am gray-headed,

the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.<BR />22 My lips will be glad when I sing unto thee; * and so will my
soul whom thou hast delivered.<BR />23 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day
