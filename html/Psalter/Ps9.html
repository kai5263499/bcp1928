      <P><B>Psalms 9. Confitebor tibi.</B><BR>
      I WILL give thanks unto thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; *
      I will speak of all thy marvellous works.<BR>
      2 I will be glad and rejoice in thee; * yea, my songs will I
      make of thy Name, O thou Most Highest.<BR>
      3 While mine enemies are driven back, * they shall fall and perish
      at thy presence.<BR>
      4 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; * thou art
      set in the throne that judgest right.<BR>
      5 Thou hast rebuked the heathen, and destroyed the ungodly; *
      thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.<BR>
      6 O thou enemy, thy destructions are come to a perpetual end;
      * even as the cities which thou hast destroyed, whose memorial
      is perished with them.<BR>
      7 But the LORD shall endure for ever; * he hath also prepared
      his seat for judgment.<BR>
      8 For he shall judge the world in righteousness, * and minister
      true judgment unto the people.<BR>
      9 The LORD also will be a defence for the oppressed, * even a
      refuge in due time of trouble.<BR>
      10 And they that know thy Name will put their trust in thee;
      * for thou, LORD, hast never failed them that seek thee.<BR>
      11 O praise the LORD which dwelleth in Sion; * show the people
      of his doings.<BR>
      12 For when he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them,
      * and forgetteth not the complaint of the poor.<BR>
      13 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider the trouble which I suffer
      of them that hate me, * thou that liftest me up from the gates
      of death;<BR>
      14 That I may show all thy praises within the gates of the daughter
      of Sion: * I will rejoice in thy salvation.<BR>
      15 The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made; * in
      the same net which they hid privily is their foot taken.<BR>
      16 The LORD is known to execute judgment; * the ungodly is trapped
      in the work of his own hands.<BR>
      17 The wicked shall be turned to destruction, * and all the people
      that forget God.<BR>
      18 For the poor shall not alway be forgotten; * the patient abiding
      of the meek shall not perish for ever.<BR>
      19 UP, LORD, and let not man have the upper hand; * let the heathen
      be judged in thy sight.<BR>
      20 Put them in fear, O LORD, * that the heathen may know themselves
      to be but men.
