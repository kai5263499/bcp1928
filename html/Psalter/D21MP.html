    <p><strong>Psalm 105. Confitemini Domino.</strong><br />
      GIVE thanks unto the LORD, and call upon his Name; * tell the people what things he hath done.<br />
      2 O let your songs be of him, and praise him; * and let your talking be of all his wondrous works.<br />
      3 Rejoice in his holy Name; * let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.<br />
      4 Seek the LORD and his strength; * seek his face evermore.<br />
      5 Remember the marvellous works that he hath done; * his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;<br />
      6 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, * ye children of Jacob his chosen.<br />
      7 He is the LORD our God; * his judgments are in all the world.<br />
      8 He hath been alway mindful of his covenant and promise, * that he made to a thousand generations;<br />
      9 Even the covenant that he made with Abraham; * and the oath that he sware unto Isaac;<br />
      10 And appointed the same unto Jacob for a law, * and to Israel for an everlasting testament;<br />
      11 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, * the lot of your inheritance:<br />
      12 When there were yet but a few of them, * and they strangers in the land;<br />
      13 What time as they went from one nation to another, * from one kingdom to another people;<br />
      14 He suffered no man to do them wrong, * but reproved even kings for their sakes;<br />
      15 Touch not mine anointed, * and do my prophets no harm.<br />
      16 Moreover, he called for a dearth upon the land, * and destroyed all the provision of bread.<br />
      17 But he had sent a man before them, * even Joseph, who was sold to be a bond-servant;<br />
      18 Whose feet they hurt in the stocks; * the iron entered into his soul;<br />
      19 Until the time came that his cause was known: * the word of the LORD tried him.<br />
      20 The king sent, and delivered him; * the prince of the people let him go free.<br />
      21 He made him lord also of his house, * and ruler of all his substance;<br />
      22 That he might inform his princes after his will, * and teach his senators wisdom.<br />
      23 Israel also came into Egypt, * and Jacob was a stranger in the land of Ham.<br />
      24 And he increased his people exceedingly, * and made them stronger than their enemies;<br />
      25 Whose heart turned so, that they hated his people, * and dealt untruly with his servants.<br />
      26 Then sent he Moses his servant, * and Aaron whom he had chosen.<br />
      27 And these showed his tokens among them, * and wonders in the land of Ham.<br />
      28 He sent darkness, and it was dark; * and they were not obedient unto his word.<br />
      29 He turned their waters into blood, * and slew their fish.<br />
      30 Their land brought forth frogs; * yea, even in their kings' chambers.<br />
      31 He spake the word, and there came all manner of flies, * and lice in all their quarters.<br />
      32 He gave them hailstones for rain; * and flames of fire in their land.<br />
      33 He smote their vines also and fig-trees; * and destroyed the trees that were in their coasts.<br />
      34 He spake the word, and the grasshoppers came, and caterpillars innumerable, * and did eat up all the grass in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.<br />
      35 He smote all the firstborn in their land; * even the chief of all their strength.<br />
      36 He brought them forth also with silver and gold; * there was not one feeble person among their tribes.<br />
      37 Egypt was glad at their departing; * for they were afraid of them.<br />
      38 He spread out a cloud to be a covering, * and fire to give light in the night season.<br />
      39 At their desire he brought quails; * and he filled them with the bread of heaven.<br />
      40 He opened the rock of stone, and the waters flowed out, * so that rivers ran in the dry places.<br />
      41 For why? he remembered his holy promise; * and Abraham his servant.<br />
      42 And he brought forth his people with joy, * and his chosen with gladness;<br />
      43 And gave them the lands of the heathen; * and they took the labours of the people in possession;<br />
    44 That they might keep his statutes, * and observe his laws.
