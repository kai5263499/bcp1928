      The Twelfth Day.<BR>
<BR>
      Morning Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 62. Nonne Deo?</B><BR>
      MY soul truly waiteth still upon God; * for of him cometh my
      salvation.<BR>
      2 He verily is my strength and my salvation; * he is my defence,
      so that I shall not greatly fall.<BR>
      3 How long will ye imagine mischief against every man? * Ye shall
      be slain all the sort of you; yea, as a tottering wall shall
      ye be, and like a broken hedge.<BR>
      4 Their device is only how to put him out whom God will exalt;
      * their delight is in lies; they give good words with their mouth,
      but curse with their heart.<BR>
      5 Nevertheless, my soul, wait thou still upon God; * for my hope
      is in him.<BR>
      6 He truly is my strength and my salvation; * he is my defence,
      so that I shall not fall.<BR>
      7 In God is my health and my glory; * the rock of my might; and
      in God is my trust.<BR>
      8 O put your trust in him alway, ye people; * pour out your hearts
      before him, for God is our hope.<BR>
      9 As for the children of men, they are but vanity; the children
      of men are deceitful; * upon the weights they are altogether
      lighter than vanity itself.<BR>
      10 O trust not in wrong and robbery; give not yourselves unto
      vanity: * if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.<BR>
      11 God spake once, and twice I have also heard the same, * that
      power belongeth unto God;<BR>
      12 And that thou, Lord, art merciful; * for thou rewardest every
      man according to his work.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 63. Deus, Deus meus.</B><BR>
      O GOD, thou art my God; * early will I seek thee.<BR>
      2 My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh also longeth after thee,
      * in a barren and dry land where no water is.<BR>
      3 Thus have I looked for thee in the sanctuary, * that I might
      behold thy power and glory.<BR>
      4 For thy loving-kindness is better than the life itself: * my
      lips shall praise thee.<BR>
      5 As long as I live will I magnify thee in this manner, * and
      lift up my hands in thy Name.<BR>
      6 My soul shall be satisfied, even as it were with marrow and
      fatness, * when my mouth praiseth thee with joyful lips.<BR>
      7 Have I not remembered thee in my bed, * and thought upon thee
      when I was waking?<BR>
      8 Because thou hast been my helper; * therefore under the shadow
      of thy wings will I rejoice.<BR>
      9 My soul hangeth upon thee; * thy right hand hath upholden me.<BR>
      10 These also that seek the hurt of my soul, * they shall go
      under the earth.<BR>
      11 Let them fall upon the edge of the sword, * that they may
      be a portion for foxes.<BR>
      12 But the King shall rejoice in God; all they also that swear
      by him shall be commended; * for the mouth of them that speak
      lies shall be stopped.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 64. Exaudi, Deus.</B><BR>
      HEAR my voice, O God, in my prayer; * preserve my life from fear
      of the enemy.<BR>
      2 Hide me from the gathering together of the froward, * and from
      the insurrection of wicked doers;<BR>
      3 Who have whet their tongue like a sword, * and shoot out their
      arrows, even bitter words;<BR>
      4 That they may privily shoot at him that is perfect: * suddenly
      do they hit him, and fear not.<BR>
      5 They encourage themselves in mischief, * and commune among
      themselves, how they may lay snares; and say, that no man shall
      see them.<BR>
      6 They imagine wickedness, and practise it; * that they keep
      secret among themselves, every man in the deep of his heart.<BR>
      7 But God shall suddenly shoot at them with a swift arrow, *
      that they shall be wounded.<BR>
      8 Yea, their own tongues shall make them fall; * insomuch that
      whoso seeth them shall laugh them to scorn.<BR>
      9 And all men that see it shall say, This hath God done; * for
      they shall perceive that it is his work.<BR>
      10 The righteous shall rejoice in the LORD, and put his trust
      in him; * and all they that are true of heart shall be glad.<BR>

      <P><CENTER><A NAME="anchor439322"></A>Evening Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 65. Te decet hymnus.</B><BR>
      THOU, O God, art praised in Sion; * and unto thee shall the vow
      be performed in Jerusalem.<BR>
      2 Thou that hearest the prayer, * unto thee shall all flesh come.<BR>
      3 My misdeeds prevail against me: * O be thou merciful unto our
      sins.<BR>
      4 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and receivest unto thee:
      * he shall dwell in thy court, and shall be satisfied with the
      pleasures of thy house, even of thy holy temple.<BR>
      5 Thou shalt show us wonderful things in thy righteousness, O
      God of our salvation; * thou that art the hope of all the ends
      of the earth, and of them that remain in the broad sea.<BR>
      6 Who in his strength setteth fast the mountains, * and is girded
      about with power.<BR>
      7 Who stilleth the raging of the sea, * and the noise of his
      waves, and the madness of the peoples.<BR>
      8 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts of the earth shall
      be afraid at thy tokens, * thou that makest the out-goings of
      the morning and evening to praise thee.<BR>
      9 Thou visitest the earth, and blessest it; * thou makest it
      very plenteous.<BR>
      10 The river of God is full of water: * thou preparest their
      corn, for so thou providest for the earth.<BR>
      11 Thou waterest her furrows; thou sendest rain into the little
      valleys thereof; * thou makest it soft with the drops of rain,
      and blessest the increase of it.<BR>
      12 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; * and thy clouds
      drop fatness.<BR>
      13 They shall drop upon the dwellings of the wilderness; * and
      the little hills shall rejoice on every side.<BR>
      14 The folds shall be full of sheep; * the valleys also shall
      stand so thick with corn, that they shall laugh and sing.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 66. Jubilate Deo.</B><BR>
      O BE joyful in God, all ye lands; * sing praises unto the honour
      of his Name; make his praise to be glorious.<BR>
      2 Say unto God, O how wonderful art thou in thy works! * through
      the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies bow down unto
      thee.<BR>
      3 For all the world shall worship thee, * sing of thee, and praise
      thy Name.<BR>
      4 O come hither, and behold the works of God; * how wonderful
      he is in his doing toward the children of men.<BR>
      5 He turned the sea into dry land, * so that they went through
      the water on foot; there did we rejoice thereof.<BR>
      6 He ruleth with his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations:
      * and such as will not believe shall not be able to exalt themselves.<BR>
      7 O praise our God, ye peoples, * and make the voice of his praise
      to be heard;<BR>
      8 Who holdeth our soul in life; * and suffereth not our feet
      to slip.<BR>
      9 For thou, O God, hast proved us; * thou also hast tried us,
      like as silver is tried.<BR>
      10 Thou broughtest us into the snare; * and laidest trouble upon
      our loins.<BR>
      11 Thou sufferedst men to ride over our heads; * we went through
      fire and water, and thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.<BR>
      12 I will go into thine house with burnt-offerings, and will
      pay thee my vows, * which I promised with my lips, and spake
      with my mouth, when I was in trouble.<BR>
      13 I will offer unto thee fat burnt-sacrifices, with the incense
      of rams; * I will offer bullocks and goats.<BR>
      14 O come hither, and hearken, all ye that fear God; * and I
      will tell you what he hath done for my soul.<BR>
      15 I called unto him with my mouth, * and gave him praises with
      my tongue.<BR>
      16 If I incline unto wickedness with mine heart, * the Lord will
      not hear me.<BR>
      17 But God hath heard me; * and considered the voice of my prayer.<BR>
      18 Praised be God, who hath not cast out my prayer, * nor turned
      his mercy from me.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 67. Deus misereatur.</B><BR>
      GOD be merciful unto us, and bless us, * and show us the light
      of his countenance, and be merciful unto us;<BR>
      2 That thy way may be known upon earth, * thy saving health among
      all nations.<BR>
      3 Let the peoples praise thee, O God; * yea, let all the peoples
      praise thee.<BR>
      4 O let the nations rejoice and be glad; * for thou shalt judge
      the folk righteously, and govern the nations upon earth.<BR>
      5 Let the peoples praise thee, O God; * yea, let all the peoples
      praise thee.<BR>
      6 Then shall the earth bring forth her increase; * and God, even
      our own God, shall give us his blessing.<BR>
      7 God shall bless us; * and all the ends of the world shall fear
      him.</P>
