      <P><B>Psalms 42. Quemadmodum.</B><BR>
      LIKE as the hart desireth the water-brooks, * so longeth my soul
      after thee, O God.<BR>
      2 My soul is athirst for God, yea, even for the living God: *
      when shall I come to appear before the presence of God?<BR>
      3 My tears have been my meat day and night, * while they daily
      say unto me, Where is now thy God?<BR>
      4 Now when I think thereupon, I pour out my heart by myself;
      * for I went with the multitude, and brought them forth into
      the house of God;<BR>
      5 In the voice of praise and thanksgiving, * among such as keep
      holy-day.<BR>
      6 Why art thou so full of heaviness, O my soul? * and why art
      thou so disquieted within me?<BR>
      7 O put thy trust in God; * for I will yet thank him, which is
      the help of my countenance, and my God.<BR>
      8 My soul is vexed within me; * therefore will I remember thee
      from the land of Jordan, from Hermon and the little hill.<BR>
      9 One deep calleth another, because of the noise of thy water-floods;
      * all thy waves and storms are gone over me.<BR>
      10 The LORD will grant his loving-kindness in the daytime; *
      and in the night season will I sing of him, and make my prayer
      unto the God of my life.<BR>
      11 I will say unto the God of my strength, Why hast thou forgotten
      me? * why go I thus heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?<BR>
      12 My bones are smitten asunder as with a sword, * while mine
      enemies that trouble me cast me in the teeth;<BR>
      13 Namely, while they say daily unto me, * Where is now thy God?<BR>
      14 Why art thou so vexed, O my soul? * and why art thou so disquieted
      within me?<BR>
      15 O put thy trust in God; * for I will yet thank him, which
      is the help of my countenance, and my God.
