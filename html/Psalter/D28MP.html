    <p><strong>Psalm 132. Memento, Domine.<br />
      </strong>LORD, remember David, * and all his trouble:<br />
      2 How he sware unto the LORD, * and vowed a vow unto the Almighty God of Jacob:<br />
      3 I will not come within the tabernacle of mine house, * nor climb up into my bed;<br />
      4 I will not suffer mine eyes to sleep, nor mine eyelids to slumber; * neither the temples of my head to take any rest;<br />
      5 Until I find out a place for the temple of the LORD; * an habitation for the Mighty God of Jacob.<br />
      6 Lo, we heard of the same at Ephratah, * and found it in the wood.<br />
      7 We will go into his tabernacle, * and fall low on our knees before his footstool.<br />
      8 Arise, O LORD, into thy resting-place; * thou, and the ark of thy strength.<br />
      9 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; * and let thy saints sing with joyfulness.<br />
      10 For thy servant David's sake, * turn not away the face of thine anointed.<br />
      11 The LORD hath made a faithful oath unto David, * and he shall not shrink from it:<br />
      12 Of the fruit of thy body * shall I set upon thy throne.<br />
      13 If thy children will keep my covenant, and my testimonies that I shall teach them; * their children also shall sit upon thy throne for evermore.<br />
      14 For the LORD hath chosen Sion to be an habitation for himself; * he hath longed for her.<br />
      15 This shall be my rest for ever: * here will I dwell, for I have a delight therein.<br />
      16 I will bless her victuals with increase, * and will satisfy her poor with bread.<br />
      17 I will deck her priests with health, * and her saints shall rejoice and sing.<br />
      18 There shall I make the horn of David to flourish: * I have ordained a lantern for mine anointed.<br />
      19 As for his enemies, I shall clothe them with shame; * but upon himself shall his crown flourish.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 133. Ecce, quam bonum!</strong><br />
      BEHOLD, how good and joyful a thing it is, * for brethren to dwell together in unity!<br />
      2 It is like the precious oil upon the head, that ran down unto the beard, * even unto Aaron's beard, and went down to the skirts of his clothing.<br />
      3 Like as the dew of Hermon, * which fell upon the hill of Sion.<br />
      4 For there the LORD promised his blessing, * and life for evermore.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 134. Ecce nunc.</strong><br />
      BEHOLD now, praise the LORD, * all ye servants of the LORD;<br />
      2 Ye that by night stand in the house of the LORD, * even in the courts of the house of our God.<br />
      3 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, * and praise the LORD.<br />
      4 The LORD that made heaven and earth * give thee blessing out of Sion.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 135. Laudate Nomen.</strong><br />
      O PRAISE the LORD, laud ye the Name of the LORD; * praise it, O ye servants of the LORD;<br />
      2 Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, * in the courts of the house of our God.<br />
      3 O praise the LORD, for the LORD is gracious; * O sing praises unto his Name, for it is lovely.<br />
      4 For why? the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, * and Israel for his own possession.<br />
      5 For I know that the LORD is great, * and that our Lord is above all gods.<br />
      6 Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth; * and in the sea, and in all deep places.<br />
      7 He bringeth forth the clouds from the ends of the world, * and sendeth forth lightnings with the rain, bringing the winds out of his treasuries.<br />
      8 He smote the firstborn of Egypt, * both of man and beast.<br />
      9 He hath sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O thou land of Egypt; * upon Pharaoh, and all his servants.<br />
      10 He smote divers nations, * and slew mighty kings:<br />
      11 Sihon, king of the Amorites; and Og, the king of Bashan; * and all the kingdoms of Canaan;<br />
      12 And gave their land to be an heritage, * even an heritage unto Israel his people.<br />
      13 Thy Name, O LORD, endureth for ever; * so doth thy memorial, O LORD, from one generation to another.<br />
      14 For the LORD will avenge his people, * and be gracious unto his servants.<br />
      15 As for the images of the heathen, they are but silver and gold; * the work of men's hands.<br />
      16 They have mouths, and speak not; * eyes have they, but they see not.<br />
      17 They have ears, and yet they hear not; * neither is there any breath in their mouths.<br />
      18 They that make them are like unto them; * and so are all they that put their trust in them.<br />
      19 Praise the LORD, ye house of Israel; * praise the LORD, ye house of Aaron.<br />
      20 Praise the LORD, ye house of Levi; * ye that fear the LORD, praise the LORD.<br />
      21 Praised be the LORD out of Sion, * who dwelleth at Jerusalem.<br />
