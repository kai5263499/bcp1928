    <p><strong>Psalm 126. In convertendo.</strong><br />
      WHEN the LORD turned again the captivity of Sion, then were we like unto them that dream.<br />
      2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, * and our tongue with joy.<br />
      3 Then said they among the heathen, * The LORD hath done great things for them.<br />
      4 Yea, the LORD hath done great things for us already; * whereof we rejoice.<br />
      5 Turn our captivity, O LORD, * as the rivers in the south.<br />
      6 They that sow in tears * shall reap in joy.<br />
      7 He that now goeth on his way weeping, and beareth forth good seed, * shall doubtless come again with joy, and bring his sheaves with him.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 127. Nisi Dominus.</strong><br />
      EXCEPT the LORD build the house, * their labour is but lost that build it.<br />
      2 Except the LORD keep the city, * the watchman waketh but in vain.<br />
      3 It is but lost labour that ye haste to rise up early, and so late take rest, and eat the bread of carefulness; * for so he giveth his beloved sleep.<br />
      4 Lo, children, and the fruit of the womb, * are an heritage and gift that cometh of the LORD.<br />
      5 Like as the arrows in the hand of the giant, * even so are the young children.<br />
      6 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them; * they shall not be ashamed when they speak with their enemies in the gate.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 128. Beati omnes.</strong><br />
      BLESSED are all they that fear the LORD, * and walk in his ways.<br />
      2 For thou shalt eat the labours of thine hands: * O well is thee, and happy shalt thou be.<br />
      3 Thy wife shall be as the fruitful vine * upon the walls of thine house;<br />
      4 Thy children like the olive-branches * round about thy table.<br />
      5 Lo, thus shall the man be blessed * that feareth the LORD.<br />
      6 The LORD from out of Sion shall so bless thee, * that thou shalt see Jerusalem in prosperity all thy life long;<br />
      7 Yea, that thou shalt see thy children's children, * and peace upon Israel.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 129. Saepe expugnaverunt.</strong><br />
      MANY a time have they fought against me from my youth up, * may Israel now say;<br />
      2 Yea, many a time have they vexed me from my youth up; * but they have not prevailed against me.<br />
      3 The plowers plowed upon my back, * and made long furrows.<br />
      4 But the righteous LORD * hath hewn the snares of the ungodly in pieces.<br />
      5 Let them be confounded and turned backward, * as many as have evil will at Sion.<br />
      6 Let them be even as the grass upon the housetops, * which withereth afore it be grown up;<br />
      7 Whereof the mower filleth not his hand, * neither he that bindeth up the sheaves his bosom.<br />
      8 So that they who go by say not so much as, The LORD prosper you; * we wish you good luck in the Name of the LORD.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 130. De profundis.</strong><br />
      OUT of the deep have I called unto thee, O LORD; * Lord, hear my voice.<br />
      2 O let thine ears consider well * the voice of my complaint.<br />
      3 If thou, LORD, wilt be extreme to mark what is done amiss, * O Lord, who may abide it?<br />
      4 For there is mercy with thee; * therefore shalt thou be feared.<br />
      5 I look for the LORD; my soul doth wait for him; * in his word is my trust.<br />
      6 My soul fleeth unto the Lord before the morning watch; * I say, before the morning watch.<br />
      7 O Israel, trust in the LORD; for with the LORD there is mercy, * and with him is plenteous redemption.<br />
      8 And he shall redeem Israel * from all his sins.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 131. Domine, non est.</strong><br />
      LORD, I am not high-minded; * I have no proud looks.<br />
      2 I do not exercise myself in great matters * which are too high for me.<br />
      3 But I refrain my soul, and keep it low, like as a child that is weaned from his mother: * yea, my soul is even as a weaned child.<br />
    4 O Israel, trust in the LORD * from this time forth for evermore.
