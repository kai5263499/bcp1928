      The Thirteenth Day.<BR>
<BR>
      Morning Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 68. Exsurgat Deus.</B><BR>
      LET God arise, and let his enemies be scattered; * let them also
      that hate him flee before him.<BR>
      2 Like as the smoke vanisheth, so shalt thou drive them away;
      * and like as wax melteth at the fire, so let the ungodly perish
      at the presence of God.<BR>
      3 But let the righteous be glad, and rejoice before God; * let
      them also be merry and joyful.<BR>
      4 O sing unto God, and sing praises unto his Name; magnify him
      that rideth upon the heavens; * praise him in his Name JAH, and
      rejoice before him.<BR>
      5 He is a Father of the fatherless, and defendeth the cause of
      the widows; * even God in his holy habitation.<BR>
      6 He is the God that maketh men to be of one mind in an house,
      and bringeth the prisoners out of captivity; * but letteth the
      runagates continue in scarceness.<BR>
      7 O God, when thou wentest forth before the people; * when thou
      wentest through the wilderness,<BR>
      8 The earth shook, and the heavens dropped at the presence of
      God; * even as Sinai also was moved at the presence of God, who
      is the God of Israel.<BR>
      9 Thou, O God, sentest a gracious rain upon thine inheritance,
      * and refreshedst it when it was weary.<BR>
      10 Thy congregation shall dwell therein; * for thou, O God, hast
      of thy goodness prepared for the poor.<BR>
      11 The Lord gave the word; * great was the company of women that
      bare the tidings.<BR>
      12 Kings with their armies did flee, and were discomfited, *
      and they of the household divided the spoil.<BR>
      13 Though ye have lain among the sheep-folds, yet shall ye be
      as the wings of a dove * that is covered with silver wings, and
      her feathers like gold.<BR>
      14 When the Almighty scattered kings for their sake, * then were
      they as white as snow in Salmon.<BR>
      15 As the hill of Bashan, so is God's hill; * even an high hill,
      as the hill of Bashan.<BR>
      16 Why mock ye so, ye high hills? this is God's hill, in the
      which it pleaseth him to dwell; * yea, the LORD will abide in
      it for ever.<BR>
      17 The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of
      angels; * and the Lord is among them as in the holy place of
      Sinai.<BR>
      18 Thou art gone up on high, thou hast led captivity captive,
      and received gifts from men; * yea, even from thine enemies,
      that the LORD God might dwell among them.<BR>
      19 Praised be the Lord daily, * even the God who helpeth us,
      and poureth his benefits upon us.<BR>
      20 He is our God, even the God of whom cometh salvation: * GOD
      is the Lord, by whom we escape death.<BR>
      21 God shall wound the head of his enemies, * and the hairy scalp
      of such a one as goeth on still in his wickedness.<BR>
      22 The Lord hath said, I will bring my people again, as I did
      from Bashan; * mine own will I bring again, as I did sometime
      from the deep of the sea.<BR>
      23 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies,
      * and that the tongue of thy dogs may be red through the same.<BR>
      24 It is well seen, O God, how thou goest; * how thou, my God
      and King, goest in the sanctuary.<BR>
      25 The singers go before, the minstrels follow after, * in the
      midst of the damsels playing with the timbrels.<BR>
      26 Give thanks unto God the Lord in the congregation, * ye that
      are of the fountain of Israel.<BR>
      27 There is little Benjamin their ruler, and the princes of Judah
      their council; * the princes of Zebulon, and the princes of Naphthali.<BR>
      28 Thy God hath sent forth strength for thee; * stablish the
      thing, O God, that thou hast wrought in us,<BR>
      29 For thy temple's sake at Jerusalem; * so shall kings bring
      presents unto thee.<BR>
      30 Rebuke thou the dragon and the bull, with the leaders of the
      heathen, so that they humbly bring pieces of silver; * scatter
      thou the peoples that delight in war;<BR>
      31 Then shall the princes come out of Egypt; * the Morians' land
      shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.<BR>
      32 Sing unto God, O ye kingdoms of the earth; * O sing praises
      unto the Lord;<BR>
      33 Who sitteth in the heavens over all, from the beginning: *
      lo, he doth send out his voice; yea, and that a mighty voice.<BR>
      34 Ascribe ye the power to God over Israel; * his worship and
      strength is in the clouds.<BR>
      35 O God, wonderful art thou in thy holy places: * even the God
      of Israel, he will give strength and power unto his people. Blessed
      be God.<BR>

      <P><B>Psalm 69. Salvum me fac.</B><BR>
      SAVE me, O God; * for the waters are come in, even unto my soul.<BR>
      2 I stick fast in the deep mire, where no ground is; * I am come
      into deep waters, so that the floods run over me.<BR>
      3 I am weary of crying; my throat is dry; * my sight faileth
      me for waiting so long upon my God.<BR>
      4 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of
      my head; * they that are mine enemies, and would destroy me guiltless,
      are mighty.<BR>
      5 I paid them the things that I never took: * God, thou knowest
      my simpleness, and my faults are not hid from thee.<BR>
      6 Let not them that trust in thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed
      for my cause; * let not those that seek thee be confounded through
      me, O Lord God of Israel.<BR>
      7 And why? for thy sake have I suffered reproof; * shame hath
      covered my face.<BR>
      8 I am become a stranger unto my brethren, * even an alien unto
      my mother's children.<BR>
      9 For the zeal of thine house hath even eaten me; * and the rebukes
      of them that rebuked thee are fallen upon me.<BR>
      10 I wept, and chastened myself with fasting, * and that was
      turned to my reproof.<BR>
      11 I put on sackcloth also, * and they jested upon me.<BR>
      12 They that sit in the gate speak against me, * and the drunkards
      make songs upon me.<BR>
      13 But, LORD, I make my prayer unto thee * in an acceptable time.<BR>
      14 Hear me, O God, in the multitude of thy mercy, * even in the
      truth of thy salvation.<BR>
      15 Take me out of the mire, that I sink not; * O let me be delivered
      from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.<BR>
      16 Let not the water-flood drown me, neither let the deep swallow
      me up; * and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.<BR>
      17 Hear me, O LORD, for thy loving-kindness is comfortable; *
      turn thee unto me according to the multitude of thy mercies.<BR>
      18 And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble:
      * O haste thee, and hear me.<BR>
      19 Draw nigh unto my soul, and save it; * O deliver me, because
      of mine enemies.<BR>
      20 Thou hast known my reproach, my shame, and my dishonour: *
      mine adversaries are all in thy sight.<BR>
      21 Reproach hath broken my heart; I am full of heaviness: * I
      looked for some to have pity on me, but there was no man, neither
      found I any to comfort me.<BR>
      22 They gave me gall to eat; * and when I was thirsty they gave
      me vinegar to drink.<BR>
      23 Let their table be made a snare to take themselves withal;
      * and let the things that should have been for their wealth be
      unto them an occasion of falling.<BR>
      24 Let their eyes be blinded, that they see not; * and ever bow
      thou down their backs.<BR>
      25 Pour out thine indignation upon them, * and let thy wrathful
      displeasure take hold of them.<BR>
      26 Let their habitation be void, * and no man to dwell in their
      tents.<BR>
      27 For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; * and they
      talk how they may vex them whom thou hast wounded.<BR>
      28 Let them fall from one wickedness to another, * and not come
      into thy righteousness.<BR>
      29 Let them be wiped out of the book of the living, * and not
      be written among the righteous.<BR>
      30 As for me, when I am poor and in heaviness, * thy help, O
      God, shall lift me up.<BR>
      31 I will praise the Name of God with a song, * and magnify it
      with thanksgiving.<BR>
      32 This also shall please the LORD * better than a bullock that
      hath horns and hoofs.<BR>
      33 The humble shall consider this, and be glad: * seek ye after
      God, and your soul shall live.<BR>
      34 For the LORD heareth the poor, * and despiseth not his prisoners.<BR>
      35 Let heaven and earth praise him: * the sea, and all that moveth
      therein.<BR>
      36 For God will save Sion, and build the cities of Judah, * that
      men may dwell there, and have it in possession.<BR>
      37 The posterity also of his servants shall inherit it; * and
      they that love his Name shall dwell therein.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 70. Deus, in adjutorium.</B><BR>
      HASTE thee, O God, to deliver me; * make haste to help me, O
      LORD.<BR>
      2 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul;
      * let them be turned backward and put to confusion that wish
      me evil.<BR>
      3 Let them for their reward be soon brought to shame, * that
      cry over me, There! there!<BR>
      4 But let all those that seek thee be joyful and glad in thee:
      * and let all such as delight in thy salvation say alway, The
      Lord be praised.<BR>
      5 As for me, I am poor and in misery: * haste thee unto me, O
      God.<BR>
      6 Thou art my helper, and my redeemer: * O LORD, make no long
      tarrying.</P>
