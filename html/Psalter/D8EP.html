    <p><strong>Psalm 41. Beatus qui intelligit.</strong><br />
      BLESSED is he that considereth the poor and needy; * the LORD shall deliver him in the time of trouble.<br />
      2 The LORD preserve him, and keep him alive, that he may be blessed upon earth; * and deliver not thou him into the will of his enemies.<br />
      3 The LORD comfort him when he lieth sick upon his bed; * make thou all his bed in his sickness.<br />
      4 I said, LORD, be merciful unto me; * heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee.<br />
      5 Mine enemies speak evil of me, * When shall he die, and his name perish?<br />
      6 And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity, * and his heart conceiveth falsehood within himself; and when he cometh forth, he telleth it.<br />
      7 All mine enemies whisper together against me; * even against me do they imagine this evil.<br />
      8 An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him; * and now that he lieth, he shall rise up no more.<br />
      9 Yea, even mine own familiar friend whom I trusted, * who did also eat of my bread, hath laid great wait for me.<br />
      10 But be thou merciful unto me, O LORD; * raise thou me up again, and I shall reward them.<br />
      11 By this I know thou favourest me, * that mine enemy doth not triumph against me.<br />
      12 And in my innocency thou upholdest me, * and shalt set me before thy face for ever.<br />
    13 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, * world without end. Amen.</p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 42. Quemadmodum.</strong><br />
      LIKE as the hart desireth the water-brooks, * so longeth my soul after thee, O God.<br />
      2 My soul is athirst for God, yea, even for the living God: * when shall I come to appear before the presence of God?<br />
      3 My tears have been my meat day and night, * while they daily say unto me, Where is now thy God?<br />
      4 Now when I think thereupon, I pour out my heart by myself; * for I went with the multitude, and brought them forth into the house of God;<br />
      5 In the voice of praise and thanksgiving, * among such as keep holy-day.<br />
      6 Why art thou so full of heaviness, O my soul? * and why art thou so disquieted within me?<br />
      7 O put thy trust in God; * for I will yet thank him, which is the help of my countenance, and my God.<br />
      8 My soul is vexed within me; * therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, from Hermon and the little hill.<br />
      9 One deep calleth another, because of the noise of thy water-floods; * all thy waves and storms are gone over me.<br />
      10 The LORD will grant his loving-kindness in the daytime; * and in the night season will I sing of him, and make my prayer unto the God of my life.<br />
      11 I will say unto the God of my strength, Why hast thou forgotten me? * why go I thus heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?<br />
      12 My bones are smitten asunder as with a sword, * while mine enemies that trouble me cast me in the teeth;<br />
      13 Namely, while they say daily unto me, * Where is now thy God?<br />
      14 Why art thou so vexed, O my soul? * and why art thou so disquieted within me?<br />
      15 O put thy trust in God; * for I will yet thank him, which is the help of my countenance, and my God.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 43. Judica me, Deus.</strong><br />
      GIVE sentence with me, O God, and defend my cause against the ungodly people; * O deliver me from the deceitful and wicked man.<br />
      2 For thou art the God of my strength; why hast thou put me from thee? * and why go I so heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?<br />
      3 O send out thy light and thy truth, that they may lead me, * and bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy dwelling;<br />
      4 And that I may go unto the altar of God, even unto the God of my joy and gladness; * and upon the harp will I give thanks unto thee, O God, my God.<br />
      5 Why art thou so heavy, O my soul? * and why art thou so disquieted within me?<br />
    6 O put thy trust in God; * for I will yet give him thanks, which is the help of my countenance, and my God.
