      <P><B>Psalm 81. Exultate Deo.</B><BR>
      SING we merrily unto God our strength; * make a cheerful noise
      unto the God of Jacob.<BR>
      2 Take the psalm, bring hither the tabret, * the merry harp with
      the lute.<BR>
      3 Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, * even in the time appointed,
      and upon our solemn feast-day.<BR>
      4 For this was made a statute for Israel, * and a law of the
      God of Jacob.<BR>
      5 This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, * when he came
      out of the land of Egypt, and had heard a strange language.<BR>
      6 I eased his shoulder from the burden, * and his hands were
      delivered from making the pots.<BR>
      7 Thou calledst upon me in troubles, and I delivered thee; *
      and heard thee what time as the storm fell upon thee.<BR>
      8 I proved thee also * at the waters of strife.<BR>
      9 Hear, O my people; and I will assure thee, O Israel, * if thou
      wilt hearken unto me,<BR>
      10 There shall no strange god be in thee, * neither shalt thou
      worship any other god.<BR>
      11 I am the LORD thy God, who brought thee out of the land of
      Egypt: * open thy mouth wide, and I shall fill it.<BR>
      12 But my people would not hear my voice; * and Israel would
      not obey me;<BR>
      13 So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lusts, * and let
      them follow their own imaginations.<BR>
      14 O that my people would have hearkened unto me! * for if Israel
      had walked in my ways,<BR>
      15 I should soon have put down their enemies, * and turned my
      hand against their adversaries.<BR>
      16 The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto
      him; * but their time should have endured for ever.<BR>
      17 I would have fed them also with the finest wheatflour; * and
      with honey out of the stony rock would I have satisfied thee.
