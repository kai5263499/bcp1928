      <P><B>Psalm 99. Dominus regnavit.</B><BR>
      THE LORD is King, be the people never so impatient; * he sitteth
      between the Cherubim, be the earth never so unquiet.<BR>
      2 The LORD is great in Sion, * and high above all people.<BR>
      3 They shall give thanks unto thy Name, * which is great, wonderful,
      and holy.<BR>
      4 The King's power loveth judgment; thou hast prepared equity,
      * thou hast executed judgment and righteousness in Jacob.<BR>
      5 O magnify the LORD our God, and fall down before his footstool;
      * for he is holy.<BR>
      6 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among such as
      call upon his Name: * these called upon the LORD, and he heard
      them.<BR>
      7 He spake unto them out of the cloudy pillar; * for they kept
      his testimonies, and the law that he gave them.<BR>
      8 Thou heardest them, O LORD our God; * thou forgavest them,
      O God, though thou didst punish their wicked doings.<BR>
      9 O magnify the LORD our God, and worship him upon his holy hill;
      * for the LORD our God is holy.
