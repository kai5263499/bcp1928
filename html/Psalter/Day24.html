      <P><CENTER>The Twenty-fourth Day.<BR>
<BR>
      Morning Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 116. Dilexi, quoniam.</B><BR>
      MY delight is in the LORD; * because he hath heard the voice
      of my prayer;<BR>
      2 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me; * therefore will
      I call upon him as long as I live.<BR>
      3 The snares of death compassed me round about, * and the pains
      of hell gat hold upon me.<BR>
      4 I found trouble and heaviness; then called I upon the Name
      of the LORD; * O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.<BR>
      5 Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; * yea, our God is merciful.<BR>
      6 The LORD preserveth the simple: * I was in misery, and he helped
      me.<BR>
      7 Turn again then unto thy rest, O my soul; * for the LORD hath
      rewarded thee.<BR>
      8 And why? thou hast delivered my soul from death, * mine eyes
      from tears, and my feet from falling.<BR>
      9 I will walk before the LORD * in the land of the living.<BR>
      10 I believed, and therefore will I speak; but I was sore troubled:
      * I said in my haste, All men are liars.<BR>
      11 What reward shall I give unto the LORD * for all the benefits
      that he hath done unto me?<BR>
      12 I will receive the cup of salvation, * and call upon the Name
      of the LORD.<BR>
      13 I will pay my vows now in the presence of all his people:
      * right dear in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.<BR>
      14 Behold, O LORD, how that I am thy servant; * I am thy servant,
      and the son of thine handmaid; thou hast broken my bonds in sunder.<BR>
      15 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, * and
      will call upon the Name of the LORD.<BR>
      16 I will pay my vows unto the LORD, in the sight of all his
      people, * in the courts of the LORD'S house; even in the midst
      of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise the LORD.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 117. Laudate Dominum.</B><BR>
      O PRAISE the LORD, all ye nations; * praise him, all ye peoples.<BR>
      2 For his merciful kindness is ever more and more toward us;
      * and the truth of the LORD endureth for ever. Praise the LORD.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 118. Confitemini Domino.</B><BR>
      O GIVE thanks unto the LORD, for he is gracious; * because his
      mercy endureth for ever.<BR>
      2 Let Israel now confess that he is gracious, * and that his
      mercy endureth for ever.<BR>
      3 Let the house of Aaron now confess, * that his mercy endureth
      for ever.<BR>
      4 Yea, let them now that fear the LORD confess, * that his mercy
      endureth for ever.<BR>
      5 I called upon the LORD in trouble; * and the LORD heard me
      at large.<BR>
      6 The LORD is on my side; * I will not fear what man doeth unto
      me.<BR>
      7 The LORD taketh my part with them that help me; * therefore
      shall I see my desire upon mine enemies.<BR>
      8 It is better to trust in the LORD, * than to put any confidence
      in man.<BR>
      9 It is better to trust in the LORD, * than to put any confidence
      in princes.<BR>
      10 All nations compassed me round about; * but in the Name of
      the LORD will I destroy them.<BR>
      11 They kept me in on every side, they kept me in, I say, on
      every side; * but in the Name of the LORD will I destroy them.<BR>
      12 They came about me like bees, and are extinct even as the
      fire among the thorns; * for in the Name of the LORD I will destroy
      them.<BR>
      13 Thou hast thrust sore at me, that I might fall; * but the
      LORD was my help.<BR>
      14 The LORD is my strength, and my song; * and is become my salvation.<BR>
      15 The voice of joy and health is in the dwellings of the righteous;
      * the right hand of the LORD bringeth mighty things to pass.<BR>
      16 The right hand of the LORD hath the pre-eminence; * the right
      hand of the LORD bringeth mighty things to pass.<BR>
      17 I shall not die, but live, * and declare the works of the
      LORD.<BR>
      18 The LORD hath chastened and corrected me; * but he hath not
      given me over unto death.<BR>
      19 Open me the gates of righteousness, * that I may go into them,
      and give thanks unto the LORD.<BR>
      20 This is the gate of the LORD, * the righteous shall enter
      into it.<BR>
      21 I will thank thee; for thou hast heard me, * and art become
      my salvation.<BR>
      22 The same stone which the builders refused, * is become the
      head-stone in the comer.<BR>
      23 This is the LORD'S doing, * and it is marvellous in our eyes.<BR>
      24 This is the day which the LORD hath made; * we will rejoice
      and be glad in it.<BR>
      25 Help me now, O LORD: * O LORD, send us now prosperity.<BR>
      26 Blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the LORD: * we have
      wished you good luck, we that are of the house of the LORD.<BR>
      27 God is the LORD, who hath showed us light: * bind the sacrifice
      with cords, yea, even unto the horns of the altar.<BR>
      28 Thou art my God, and I will thank thee; * thou art my God,
      and I will praise thee.<BR>
      29 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is gracious, * and his
      mercy endureth for ever.<BR>

      <P><CENTER><A NAME="anchor468577"></A>Evening Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 119. I. Beati immaculati.</B><BR>
      BLESSED are those that are undefiled in the way, and walk in
      the law of the LORD.<BR>
      2 Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, * and seek him
      with their whole heart;<BR>
      3 Even they who do no wickedness, * and walk in his ways.<BR>
      4 Thou hast charged * that we shall diligently keep thy commandments.<BR>
      5 O that my ways were made so direct, * that I might keep thy
      statutes!<BR>
      6 So shall I not be confounded, * while I have respect unto all
      thy commandments.<BR>
      7 I will thank thee with an unfeigned heart, * when I shall have
      learned the judgments of thy righteousness.<BR>
      8 I will keep thy statutes; * O forsake me not utterly.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      II. In quo corrigit?<BR>
      WHEREWITHAL shall a young man cleanse his way? * even by ruling
      himself after thy word.<BR>
      10 With my whole heart have I sought thee; * O let me not go
      wrong out of thy commandments.<BR>
      11 Thy word have I hid within my heart, * that I should not sin
      against thee.<BR>
      12 Blessed art thou, O LORD; * O teach me thy statutes.<BR>
      13 With my lips have I been telling * of all the judgments of
      thy mouth.<BR>
      14 I have had as great delight in the way of thy testimonies,
      * as in all manner of riches.<BR>
      15 I will talk of thy commandments, * and have respect unto thy
      ways.<BR>
      16 My delight shall be in thy statutes, * and I will not forget
      thy word.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      III. Retribue servo tuo.<BR>
      O DO well unto thy servant; * that I may live, and keep thy word.<BR>
      18 Open thou mine eyes; * that I may see the wondrous things
      of thy law.<BR>
      19 I am a stranger upon earth; * O hide not thy commandments
      from me.<BR>
      20 My soul breaketh out for the very fervent desire * that it
      hath alway unto thy judgments.<BR>
      21 Thou hast rebuked the proud; * and cursed are they that do
      err from thy commandments.<BR>
      22 O turn from me shame and rebuke; * for I have kept thy testimonies.<BR>
      23 Princes also did sit and speak against me; * but thy servant
      is occupied in thy statutes.<BR>
      24 For thy testimonies are my delight, * and my counsellors.<BR>
<BR>
      IV. Adhaesit pavimento.<BR>
      MY soul cleaveth to the dust; * O quicken thou me, according
      to thy word.<BR>
      26 I have acknowledged my ways, and thou heardest me: * O teach
      me thy statutes.<BR>
      27 Make me to understand the way of thy commandments; * and so
      shall I talk of thy wondrous works.<BR>
      28 My soul melteth away for very heaviness; * comfort thou me
      according unto thy word.<BR>
      29 Take from me the way of lying, * and cause thou me to make
      much of thy law.<BR>
      30 I have chosen the way of truth, * and thy judgments have I
      laid before me.<BR>
      31 I have stuck unto thy testimonies; * O LORD, confound me not.<BR>
      32 I will run the way of thy commandments, * when thou hast set
      my heart at liberty.<BR>
