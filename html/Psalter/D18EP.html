    <p><strong>Psalm 93. Dominus regnavit.</strong><br />
      THE LORD is King, and hath put on glorious apparel; * the LORD hath put on his apparel, and girded himself with strength.<br />
      2 He hath made the round world so sure, * that it cannot be moved.<br />
      3 Ever since the world began, hath thy seat been prepared: * thou art from everlasting.<br />
      4 The floods are risen, O LORD, the floods have lift up their voice; * the floods lift up their waves.<br />
      5 The waves of the sea are mighty, and rage horribly; * but yet the LORD, who dwelleth on high, is mightier.<br />
      6 Thy testimonies, O LORD, are very sure: * holiness becometh thine house for ever.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 94. Deus ultionum.</strong><br />
      O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth, * thou God, to whom vengeance belongeth, show thyself.<br />
      2 Arise, thou Judge of the world, * and reward the proud after their deserving.<br />
      3 LORD, how long shall the ungodly, * how long shall the ungodly triumph?<br />
      4 How long shall all wicked doers speak so disdainfully, * and make such proud boasting?<br />
      5 They smite down thy people, O LORD, * and trouble thine heritage.<br />
      6 They murder the widow and the stranger, * and put the fatherless to death.<br />
      7 And yet they say, Tush, the LORD shall not see, * neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.<br />
      8 Take heed, ye unwise among the people: * O ye fools, when will ye understand?<br />
      9 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? * or he that made the eye, shall he not see?<br />
      10 Or he that instructeth the heathen, * it is he that teacheth man knowledge; shall not he punish?<br />
      11 The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, * that they are but vain.<br />
      12 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, * and teachest him in thy law;<br />
      13 That thou mayest give him patience in time of adversity, * until the pit be digged up for the ungodly.<br />
      14 For the LORD will not fail his people; * neither will he forsake his inheritance;<br />
      15 Until righteousness turn again unto judgment: * all such as are true in heart shall follow it.<br />
      16 Who will rise up with me against the wicked? * or who will take my part against the evil doers?<br />
      17 If the LORD had not helped me, * it had not failed, but my soul had been put to silence.<br />
      18 But when I said, My foot hath slipt; * thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.<br />
      19 In the multitude of the sorrows that I had in my heart, * thy comforts have refreshed my soul.<br />
      20 Wilt thou have any thing to do with the throne of wickedness, * which imagineth mischief as a law?<br />
      21 They gather them together against the soul of the righteous, * and condemn the innocent blood.<br />
      22 But the LORD is my refuge, * and my God is the strength of my confidence.<br />
    23 He shall recompense them their wickedness, and destroy them in their own malice; * yea, the LORD our God shall destroy them.
