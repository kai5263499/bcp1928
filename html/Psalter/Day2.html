      The Second Day.<BR>
<BR>
      Morning Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 9. Confitebor tibi.</B><BR>
      I WILL give thanks unto thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; *
      I will speak of all thy marvellous works.<BR>
      2 I will be glad and rejoice in thee; * yea, my songs will I
      make of thy Name, O thou Most Highest.<BR>
      3 While mine enemies are driven back, * they shall fall and perish
      at thy presence.<BR>
      4 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; * thou art
      set in the throne that judgest right.<BR>
      5 Thou hast rebuked the heathen, and destroyed the ungodly; *
      thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.<BR>
      6 O thou enemy, thy destructions are come to a perpetual end;
      * even as the cities which thou hast destroyed, whose memorial
      is perished with them.<BR>
      7 But the LORD shall endure for ever; * he hath also prepared
      his seat for judgment.<BR>
      8 For he shall judge the world in righteousness, * and minister
      true judgment unto the people.<BR>
      9 The LORD also will be a defence for the oppressed, * even a
      refuge in due time of trouble.<BR>
      10 And they that know thy Name will put their trust in thee;
      * for thou, LORD, hast never failed them that seek thee.<BR>
      11 O praise the LORD which dwelleth in Sion; * show the people
      of his doings.<BR>
      12 For when he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them,
      * and forgetteth not the complaint of the poor.<BR>
      13 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider the trouble which I suffer
      of them that hate me, * thou that liftest me up from the gates
      of death;<BR>
      14 That I may show all thy praises within the gates of the daughter
      of Sion: * I will rejoice in thy salvation.<BR>
      15 The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made; * in
      the same net which they hid privily is their foot taken.<BR>
      16 The LORD is known to execute judgment; * the ungodly is trapped
      in the work of his own hands.<BR>
      17 The wicked shall be turned to destruction, * and all the people
      that forget God.<BR>
      18 For the poor shall not alway be forgotten; * the patient abiding
      of the meek shall not perish for ever.<BR>
      19 UP, LORD, and let not man have the upper hand; * let the heathen
      be judged in thy sight.<BR>
      20 Put them in fear, O LORD, * that the heathen may know themselves
      to be but men.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 10. Ut quid, Domine ?</B><BR>
      WHY standest thou so far off, O LORD, * and hidest thy face in
      the needful time of trouble?<BR>
      2 The ungodly, for his own lust, doth persecute the poor: * let
      them be taken in the crafty wiliness that they have imagined.<BR>
      3 For the ungodly hath made boast of his own heart's desire,
      * and speaketh good of the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.<BR>
      4 The ungodly is so proud, that he careth not for God, * neither
      is God in all his thoughts.<BR>
      5 His ways are alway grievous; * thy judgments are far above
      out of his sight, and therefore defieth he all his enemies.<BR>
      6 For he hath said in his heart, Tush, I shall never be cast
      down, * there shall no harm happen unto me.<BR>
      7 His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and fraud; * under his
      tongue is ungodliness and vanity.<BR>
      8 He sitteth lurking in the thievish corners of the streets,
      * and privily in his lurking dens doth he murder the innocent;
      his eyes are set against the poor.<BR>
      9 For he lieth waiting secretly; even as a lion lurketh he in
      his den, * that he may ravish the poor.<BR>
      10 He doth ravish the poor, * when he getteth him into his net.<BR>
      11 He falleth down, and humbleth himself, * that the congregation
      of the poor may fall into the hands of his captains.<BR>
      12 He hath said in his heart, Tush, God hath forgotten; * he
      hideth away his face, and he will never see it.<BR>
      13 Arise, O LORD God, and lift up thine hand; * forget not the
      poor.<BR>
      14 Wherefore should the wicked blaspheme God, * while he doth
      say in his heart, Tush, thou God carest not for it?<BR>
      15 Surely thou hast seen it; * for thou beholdest ungodliness
      and wrong, that thou mayest take the matter into thy hand.<BR>
      16 The poor committeth himself unto thee; * for thou art the
      helper of the friendless.<BR>
      17 Break thou the power of the ungodly and malicious; * search
      out his ungodliness, until thou find none.<BR>
      18 The LORD is King for ever and ever, * and the heathen are
      perished out of the land.<BR>
      19 LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the poor; * thou preparest
      their heart, and thine ear hearkeneth;<BR>
      20 To help the fatherless and poor unto their right, * that the
      man of the earth be no more exalted against them.<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 11. In Domino confido.</B><BR>
      IN the LORD put I my trust; * how say ye then to my soul, that
      she should flee as a bird unto the hill?<BR>
      2 For lo, the ungodly bend their bow, and make ready their arrows
      within the quiver, * that they may privily shoot at them which
      are true of heart.<BR>
      3 If the foundations be destroyed, * what can the righteous do?<BR>
      4 The LORD is in his holy temple; * the LORD'S seat is in heaven.<BR>
      5 His eyes consider the poor, * and his eyelids try the children
      of men.<BR>
      6 The LORD approveth the righteous: * but the ungodly, and him
      that delighteth in wickedness, doth his soul abhor.<BR>
      7 Upon the ungodly he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone,
      storm and tempest: * this shall be their portion to drink.<BR>
      8 For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; * his countenance
      will behold the thing that is just.<BR>

      <P><CENTER><A NAME="anchor428134"></A>Evening Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 12. Salvum me fac.</B><BR>
      HELP me, LORD, for there is not one godly man left; * for the
      faithful are minished from among the children of men.<BR>
      2 They talk of vanity every one with his neighbour; * they do
      but flatter with their lips, and dissemble in their double heart.<BR>
      3 The LORD shall root out all deceitful lips, * and the tongue
      that speaketh proud things;<BR>
      4 Which have said, With our tongue will we prevail; * we are
      they that ought to speak; who is lord over us?<BR>
      5 Now, for the comfortless troubles' sake of the needy, * and
      because of the deep sighing of the poor,<BR>
      6 I will up, saith the LORD; * and will help every one from him
      that swelleth against him, and will set him at rest.<BR>
      7 The words of the LORD are pure words; * even as the silver
      which from the earth is tried, and purified seven times in the
      fire.<BR>
      8 Thou shalt keep them, O LORD; * thou shalt preserve them from
      this generation for ever.<BR>
      9 The ungodly walk on every side: * when they are exalted, the
      children of men are put to rebuke.<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 13. Usquequo, Domine?</B><BR>
      HOW long wilt thou forget me, O LORD; for ever? * how long wilt
      thou hide thy face from me?<BR>
      2 How long shall I seek counsel in my soul, and be so vexed in
      my heart? * how long shall mine enemy triumph over me?<BR>
      3 Consider, and hear me, O LORD my God; * lighten mine eyes,
      that I sleep not in death;<BR>
      4 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him: * for if
      I be cast down, they that trouble me will rejoice at it.<BR>
      5 But my trust is in thy mercy, * and my heart is joyful in thy
      salvation.<BR>
      6 I will sing of the LORD, because he hath dealt so lovingly
      with me; * yea, I will praise the Name of the Lord Most Highest.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 14. Dixit insipiens.</B><BR>
      THE fool hath said in his heart, * There is no God.<BR>
      2 They are corrupt, and become abominable in their doings; *
      there is none that doeth good, no not one.<BR>
      3 The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men,
      * to see if there were any that would understand, and seek after
      God.<BR>
      4 But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become
      abominable; * there is none that doeth good, no not one.<BR>
      5 Have they no knowledge, that they are all such workers of mischief,
      * eating up my people as it were bread, and call not upon the
      LORD?<BR>
      6 There were they brought in great fear, even where no fear was;
      * for God is in the generation of the righteous.<BR>
      7 As for you, ye have made a mock at the counsel of the poor;
      * because he putteth his trust in the LORD.<BR>
      8 Who shall give salvation unto Israel out of Sion? * When the
      LORD turneth the captivity of his people, then shall Jacob rejoice,
      and Israel shall be glad.</P>
