      <P><B>Psalms 50. Deus deorum.</B><BR>
      THE LORD, even the Most Mighty God, hath spoken, * and called
      the world, from the rising up of the sun unto the going down
      thereof.<BR>
      2 Out of Sion hath God appeared * in perfect beauty.<BR>
      3 Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence; * there shall
      go before him a consuming fire, and a mighty tempest shall be
      stirred up round about him.<BR>
      4 He shall call the heaven from above, * and the earth, that
      he may judge his people.<BR>
      5 Gather my saints together unto me; * those that have made a
      covenant with me with sacrifice.<BR>
      6 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness; * for God
      is Judge himself.<BR>
      7 Hear, O my people, and I will speak; * I myself will testify
      against thee, O Israel; for I am God, even thy God.<BR>
      8 I will not reprove thee because of thy sacrifices; * as for
      thy burnt-offerings, they are alway before me.<BR>
      9 I will take no bullock out of thine house, * nor he-goats out
      of thy folds.<BR>
      10 For all the beasts of the forest are mine, * and so are the
      cattle upon a thousand hills.<BR>
      11 I know all the fowls upon the mountains, * and the wild beasts
      of the field are in my sight.<BR>
      12 If I be hungry, I will not tell thee; * for the whole world
      is mine, and all that is therein.<BR>
      13 Thinkest thou that I will eat bulls' flesh, * and drink the
      blood of goats?<BR>
      14 Offer unto God thanksgiving, * and pay thy vows unto the Most
      Highest.<BR>
      15 And call upon me in the time of trouble; * so will I hear
      thee, and thou shalt praise me.<BR>
      16 But unto the ungodly saith God, * Why dost thou preach my
      laws, and takest my covenant in thy mouth;<BR>
      17 Whereas thou hatest to be reformed, * and hast cast my words
      behind thee?<BR>
      18 When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst unto him; * and
      hast been partaker with the adulterers.<BR>
      19 Thou hast let thy mouth speak wickedness, * and with thy tongue
      thou hast set forth deceit.<BR>
      20 Thou sattest and spakest against thy brother; * yea, and hast
      slandered thine own mother's son.<BR>
      21 These things hast thou done, and I held my tongue, and thou
      thoughtest wickedly, that I am even such a one as thyself; *
      but I will reprove thee, and set before thee the things that
      thou hast done.<BR>
      22 O consider this, ye that forget God, * lest I pluck you away,
      and there be none to deliver you.<BR>
      23 Whoso offereth me thanks and praise, he honoureth me; * and
      to him that ordereth his way aright, will I show the salvation
      of God.
