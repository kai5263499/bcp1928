      <P><B>Psalm 55. Exaudi, Deus.</B><BR>
      HEAR my prayer, O God, * and hide not thyself from my petition.<BR>
      2 Take heed unto me, and hear me, * how I mourn in my prayer,
      and am vexed;<BR>
      3 The enemy crieth so, and the ungodly cometh on so fast; * for
      they are minded to do me some mischief, so maliciously are they
      set against me.<BR>
      4 My heart is disquieted within me, * and the fear of death is
      fallen upon me.<BR>
      5 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, * and an horrible
      dread hath overwhelmed me.<BR>
      6 And I said, O that I had wings like a dove! * for then would
      I flee away, and be at rest.<BR>
      7 Lo, then would I get me away far off, * and remain in the wilderness.<BR>
      8 I would make haste to escape, * because of the stormy wind
      and tempest.<BR>
      9 Destroy their tongues, O Lord, and divide them; * for I have
      spied unrighteousness and strife in the city.<BR>
      10 Day and night they go about within the walls thereof: * mischief
      also and sorrow are in the midst of it.<BR>
      11 Wickedness is therein; * deceit and guile go not out of her
      streets.<BR>
      12 For it is not an open enemy that hath done me this dishonour;
      * for then I could have borne it;<BR>
      13 Neither was it mine adversary that did magnify himself against
      me; * for then peradventure I would have hid myself from him;<BR>
      14 But it was even thou, my companion, * my guide, and mine own
      familiar friend.<BR>
      15 We took sweet counsel together, * and walked in the house
      of God as friends.<BR>
      16 Let death come hastily upon them, and let them go down alive
      into the pit; * for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among
      them.<BR>
      17 As for me, I will call upon God, * and the LORD shall save
      me.<BR>
      18 In the evening, and morning, and at noon-day will I pray,
      and that instantly; * and he shall hear my voice.<BR>
      19 It is he that hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle
      that was against me; * for there were many that strove with me.<BR>
      20 Yea, even God, that endureth for ever, shall hear me, and
      bring them down; * for they will not turn, nor fear God.<BR>
      21 He laid his hands upon such as be at peace with him, * and
      he brake his covenant.<BR>
      22 The words of his mouth were softer than butter, having war
      in his heart; * his words were smoother than oil, and yet be
      they very swords.<BR>
      23 O cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall nourish thee,
      * and shall not suffer the righteous to fall for ever.<BR>
      24 And as for them, * thou, O God, shalt bring them into the
      pit of destruction.<BR>
      25 The blood-thirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half
      their days: * nevertheless, my trust shall be in thee, O Lord.
