      <P><B>Psalms 32. Beati quorum.</B><BR>
      BLESSED is he whose unrighteousness is forgiven, * and whose
      sin is covered.<BR>
      2 Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth no sin, * and
      in whose spirit there is no guile.<BR>
      3 For whilst I held my tongue, * my bones consumed away through
      my daily complaining.<BR>
      4 For thy hand was heavy upon me day and night, * and my moisture
      was like the drought in summer.<BR>
      5 I acknowledged my sin unto thee; * and mine unrighteousness
      have I not hid.<BR>
      6 I said, I will confess my sins unto the LORD; * and so thou
      forgavest the wickedness of my sin.<BR>
      7 For this shall every one that is godly make his prayer unto
      thee, in a time when thou mayest be found; * surely the great
      water-floods shall not come nigh him.<BR>
      8 Thou art a place to hide me in; thou shalt preserve me from
      trouble; * thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance.<BR>
      9 I will inform thee, and teach thee in the way wherein thou
      shalt go; * and I will guide thee with mine eye.<BR>
      10 Be ye not like to horse and mule, which have no understanding;
      * whose mouths must be held with bit and bridle, else they will
      not obey thee.<BR>
      11 Great plagues remain for the ungodly; * but whoso putteth
      his trust in the LORD, mercy embraceth him on every side.<BR>
      12 Be glad, O ye righteous, and rejoice in the LORD; * and be
      joyful, all ye that are true of heart.
