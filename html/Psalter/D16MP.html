    <p><strong>Psalm 79. Deus, venerunt.</strong><br />
      O GOD, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; * thy holy temple have they defiled, and made Jerusalem an heap of stones.<br />
      2 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the air, * and the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the land.<br />
      3 Their blood have they shed like water on every side of Jerusalem, * and there was no man to bury them.<br />
      4 We are become an open shame to our enemies, * a very scorn and derision unto them that are round about us.<br />
      5 LORD, how long wilt thou be angry? * shall thy jealousy burn like fire for ever?<br />
      6 Pour out thine indignation upon the heathen that have not known thee; * and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy Name.<br />
      7 For they have devoured Jacob, * and laid waste his dwelling-place.<br />
      8 O remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and that soon; * for we are come to great misery.<br />
      9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name: * O deliver us, and be merciful unto our sins, for thy Name's sake.<br />
      10 Wherefore do the heathen say, * Where is now their God?<br />
      11 O let the vengeance of thy servants' blood that is shed, * be openly showed upon the heathen, in our sight.<br />
      12 O let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before thee; * according to the greatness of thy power, preserve thou those that are appointed to die.<br />
      13 And for the blasphemy wherewith our neighbours have blasphemed thee, * reward thou them, O Lord, sevenfold into their bosom.<br />
      14 So we, that are thy people, and sheep of thy pasture, shall give thee thanks for ever, * and will alway be showing forth thy praise from generation to generation.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 80. Qui regis Israel.</strong><br />
      HEAR, O thou Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; * show thyself also, thou that sittest upon the Cherubim.<br />
      2 Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, * stir up thy strength, and come and help us.<br />
      3 Turn us again, O God; * show the light of thy countenance, and we shall be whole.<br />
      4 O LORD God of hosts, * how long wilt thou be angry with thy people that prayeth?<br />
      5 Thou feedest them with the bread of tears, * and givest them plenteousness of tears to drink.<br />
      6 Thou hast made us a very strife unto our neighbours, * and our enemies laugh us to scorn.<br />
      7 Turn us again, thou God of hosts; * show the light of thy countenance, and we shall be whole.<br />
      8 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt; * thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.<br />
      9 Thou madest room for it; * and when it had taken root, it filled the land.<br />
      10 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, * and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedar-trees.<br />
      11 She stretched out her branches unto the sea, * and her boughs unto the River.<br />
      12 Why hast thou then broken down her hedge, * that all they that go by pluck off her grapes?<br />
      13 The wild boar out of the wood doth root it up, * and the wild beasts of the field devour it.<br />
      14 Turn thee again, thou God of hosts, look down from heaven, * behold, and visit this vine;<br />
      15 And the place of the vineyard that thy right hand hath planted, * and the branch that thou madest so strong for thyself.<br />
      16 It is burnt with fire, and cut down; * and they shall perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.<br />
      17 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, * and upon the son of man, whom thou madest so strong for thine own self.<br />
      18 And so will not we go back from thee: * O let us live, and we shall call upon thy Name.<br />
      19 Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts; * show the light of thy countenance, and we shall be whole.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 81. Exultate Deo.</strong><br />
      SING we merrily unto God our strength; * make a cheerful noise unto the God of Jacob.<br />
      2 Take the psalm, bring hither the tabret, * the merry harp with the lute.<br />
      3 Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, * even in the time appointed, and upon our solemn feast-day.<br />
      4 For this was made a statute for Israel, * and a law of the God of Jacob.<br />
      5 This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, * when he came out of the land of Egypt, and had heard a strange language.<br />
      6 I eased his shoulder from the burden, * and his hands were delivered from making the pots.<br />
      7 Thou calledst upon me in troubles, and I delivered thee; * and heard thee what time as the storm fell upon thee.<br />
      8 I proved thee also * at the waters of strife.<br />
      9 Hear, O my people; and I will assure thee, O Israel, * if thou wilt hearken unto me,<br />
      10 There shall no strange god be in thee, * neither shalt thou worship any other god.<br />
      11 I am the LORD thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt: * open thy mouth wide, and I shall fill it.<br />
      12 But my people would not hear my voice; * and Israel would not obey me;<br />
      13 So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lusts, * and let them follow their own imaginations.<br />
      14 O that my people would have hearkened unto me! * for if Israel had walked in my ways,<br />
      15 I should soon have put down their enemies, * and turned my hand against their adversaries.<br />
      16 The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him; * but their time should have endured for ever.<br />
    17 I would have fed them also with the finest wheatflour; * and with honey out of the stony rock would I have satisfied thee.
