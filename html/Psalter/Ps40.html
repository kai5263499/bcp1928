      <P><B>Psalms 40. Expectans expectavi.</B><BR>
      I WAITED patiently for the LORD, * and he inclined unto me, and
      heard my calling.<BR>
      2 He brought me also out of the horrible pit, out of the mire
      and clay, * and set my feet upon the rock, and ordered my goings.<BR>
      3 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, * even a thanksgiving
      unto our God.<BR>
      4 Many shall see it, and fear, * and shall put their trust in
      the LORD.<BR>
      5 Blessed is the man that hath set his hope in the LORD, * and
      turned not unto the proud, and to such as go about with lies.<BR>
      6 O LORD my God, great are the wondrous works which thou hast
      done, like as be also thy thoughts, which are to us-ward; * and
      yet there is no man that ordereth them unto thee.<BR>
      7 If I should declare them, and speak of them, * they should
      be more than I am able to express.<BR>
      8 Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, * but mine ears hast
      thou opened.<BR>
      9 Burnt-offering and sacrifice for sin hast thou not required:
      * then said I, Lo, I come;<BR>
      10 In the volume of the book it is written of me, that I should
      fulfil thy will, O my God: * I am content to do it; yea, thy
      law is within my heart.<BR>
      11 I have declared thy righteousness in the great congregation:
      * lo, I will not refrain my lips, O LORD, and that thou knowest.<BR>
      12 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; * my talk
      hath been of thy truth, and of thy salvation.<BR>
      13 I have not kept back thy loving mercy and truth * from the
      great congregation.<BR>
      14 Withdraw not thou thy mercy from me, O LORD; * let thy loving-kindness
      and thy truth alway preserve me.<BR>
      15 For innumerable troubles are come about me; my sins have taken
      such hold upon me, that I am not able to look up; * yea, they
      are more in number than the hairs of my head, and my heart hath
      failed me.<BR>
      16 O LORD, let it be thy pleasure to deliver me; * make haste,
      O LORD, to help me.<BR>
      17 Let them be ashamed, and confounded together, that seek after
      my soul to destroy it; * let them be driven backward, and put
      to rebuke, that wish me evil.<BR>
      18 Let them be desolate, and rewarded with shame, * that say
      unto me, Fie upon thee! fie upon thee!<BR>
      19 Let all those that seek thee, be joyful and glad in thee;
      * and let such as love thy salvation, say alway, The LORD be
      praised.<BR>
      20 As for me, I am poor and needy; * but the Lord careth for
      me.<BR>
      21 Thou art my helper and redeemer; * make no long tarrying,
      O my God.
