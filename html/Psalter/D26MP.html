    <p><strong>Psalm 119. (Cont)<br />
      XIV. Lucerna pedibus meis.</strong><br />
      THY word is a lantern unto my feet, * and a light unto my paths.<br />
      106 I have sworn, and am stedfastly purposed, * to keep thy righteous judgments.<br />
      107 I am troubled above measure: * quicken me, O LORD, according to thy word.<br />
      108 Let the free-will offerings of my mouth please thee, O LORD; * and teach me thy judgments.<br />
      109 My soul is alway in my hand; * yet do I not forget thy law.<br />
      110 The ungodly have laid a snare for me; * but yet I swerved not from thy commandments.<br />
      111 Thy testimonies have I claimed as mine heritage for ever; * and why? they are the very joy of my heart.<br />
      112 I have applied my heart to fulfil thy statutes alway, * even unto the end.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>XV. Iniquos odio habui.</strong><br />
      I HATE them that imagine evil things; * but thy law do I love.<br />
      114 Thou art my defence and shield; * and my trust is in thy word.<br />
      115 Away from me, ye wicked; * I will keep the commandments of my God.<br />
      116 O stablish me according to thy word, that I may live; * and let me not be disappointed of my hope.<br />
      117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe; * yea, my delight shall be ever in thy statutes.<br />
      118 Thou hast trodden down all them that depart from thy statutes; * for they imagine but deceit.<br />
      119 Thou puttest away all the ungodly of the earth like dross; * therefore I love thy testimonies.<br />
      120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; * and I am afraid of thy judgments.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>XVI. Feci judicium.</strong><br />
      I DEAL with the thing that is lawful and right; * O give me not over unto mine oppressors.<br />
      122 Make thou thy servant to delight in that which is good, * that the proud do me no wrong.<br />
      123 Mine eyes are wasted away with looking for thy health, * and for the word of thy righteousness.<br />
      124 O deal with thy servant according unto thy loving mercy, * and teach me thy statutes.<br />
      125 I am thy servant; O grant me understanding, * that I may know thy testimonies.<br />
      126 It is time for thee, LORD, to lay to thine hand; * for they have destroyed thy law.<br />
      127 For I love thy commandments * above gold and precious stones.<br />
      128 Therefore hold I straight all thy commandments; * and all false ways I utterly abhor.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>XVII. Mirabilia.</strong><br />
      THY testimonies are wonderful; * therefore doth my soul keep them.<br />
      130 When thy word goeth forth, * it giveth light and understanding unto the simple.<br />
      131 I opened my mouth, and drew in my breath; * for my delight was in thy commandments.<br />
      132 O look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, * as thou usest to do unto those that love thy Name.<br />
      133 Order my steps in thy word; * and so shall no wickedness have dominion over me.<br />
      134 O deliver me from the wrongful dealings of men; * and so shall I keep thy commandments.<br />
      135 Show the light of thy countenance upon thy servant, * and teach me thy statutes.<br />
      136 Mine eyes gush out with water, * because men keep not thy law.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>XVIII. Justus es, Domine.</strong><br />
      RIGHTEOUS art thou, O LORD; * and true are thy judgments.<br />
      138 The testimonies that thou hast commanded * are exceeding righteous and true.<br />
      139 My zeal hath even consumed me; * because mine enemies have forgotten thy words.<br />
      140 Thy word is tried to the uttermost, * and thy servant loveth it.<br />
      141 I am small and of no reputation; * yet do I not forget thy commandments.<br />
      142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, * and thy law is the truth.<br />
      143 Trouble and heaviness have taken hold upon me; * yet is my delight in thy commandments.<br />
    144 The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: * O grant me understanding, and I shall live.
