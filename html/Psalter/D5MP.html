    <p><strong>Psalm 24. Domini est terra.</strong><br />
      THE earth is the LORD'S, and all that therein is; * the compass of the world, and they that dwell therein.<br />
      2 For he hath founded it upon the seas, * and stablished it upon the floods.<br />
      3 Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? * or who shall rise up in his holy place?<br />
      4 Even he that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; * and that hath not lift up his mind unto vanity, nor sworn to deceive his neighbour.<br />
      5 He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, * and righteousness from the God of his salvation.<br />
      6 This is the generation of them that seek him; * even of them that seek thy face, O God of Jacob.<br />
      7 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; * and the King of glory shall come in.<br />
      8 Who is this King of glory? * It is the LORD strong and mighty, even the LORD mighty in battle.<br />
      9 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; * and the King of glory shall come in.<br />
      10 Who is this King of glory? * Even the LORD of hosts, he is the King of glory.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 25. Ad te, Domine, levavi.</strong><br />
      UNTO thee, O LORD, will I lift up my soul; my God, I have put my trust in thee: * O let me not be confounded, neither let mine enemies triumph over me.<br />
      2 For all they that hope in thee shall not be ashamed; * but such as transgress without a cause shall be put to confusion.<br />
      3 Show me thy ways, O LORD, * and teach me thy paths.<br />
      4 Lead me forth in thy truth, and learn me: * for thou art the God of my salvation; in thee hath been my hope all the day long.<br />
      5 Call to remembrance, O LORD, thy tender mercies, * and thy loving-kindnesses, which have been ever of old.<br />
      6 O remember not the sins and offences of my youth; * but according to thy mercy think thou upon me, O LORD, for thy goodness.<br />
      7 Gracious and righteous is the LORD; * therefore, will he teach sinners in the way.<br />
      8 Them that are meek shall he guide in judgment; * and such as are gentle, them shall he learn his way.<br />
      9 All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth, * unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.<br />
      10 For thy Name's sake, O LORD, * be merciful unto my sin; for it is great.<br />
      11 What man is he that feareth the LORD? * him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose.<br />
      12 His soul shall dwell at ease, * and his seed shall inherit the land.<br />
      13 The secret of the LORD is among them that fear him; * and he will show them his covenant.<br />
      14 Mine eyes are ever looking unto the LORD; * for he shall pluck my feet out of the net.<br />
      15 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; * for I am desolate, and in misery.<br />
      16 The sorrows of my heart are enlarged: * O bring thou me out of my troubles.<br />
      17 Look upon my adversity and misery, * and forgive me all my sin.<br />
      18 Consider mine enemies, how many they are; * and they bear a tyrannous hate against me.<br />
      19 O keep my soul, and deliver me: * let me not be confounded, for I have put my trust in thee.<br />
      20 Let perfectness and righteous dealing wait upon me; * for my hope hath been in thee.<br />
      21 Deliver Israel, O God, * out of all his troubles.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 26. Judica me, Domine.</strong><br />
      BE thou my Judge, O LORD, for I have walked innocently: * my trust hath been also in the LORD, therefore shall I not fall.<br />
      2 Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; * try out my reins and my heart.<br />
      3 For thy loving-kindness is ever before mine eyes; * and I will walk in thy truth.<br />
      4 I have not dwelt with vain persons; * neither will I have fellowship with the deceitful.<br />
      5 I have hated the congregation of the wicked; * and will not sit among the ungodly.<br />
      6 I will wash my hands in innocency, O LORD; * and so will I go to thine altar;<br />
      7 That I may show the voice of thanksgiving, * and tell of all thy wondrous works.<br />
      8 LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, * and the place where thine honour dwelleth.<br />
      9 O shut not up my soul with the sinners, * nor my life with the blood-thirsty;<br />
      10 In whose hands is wickedness, * and their right hand is full of gifts.<br />
      11 But as for me, I will walk innocently: * O deliver me, and be merciful unto me.<br />
    12 My foot standeth right: * I will praise the LORD in the congregations.
