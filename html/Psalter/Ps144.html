      <P><B>Psalm 144. Benedictus Dominus.</B><BR>
      BLESSED be the LORD my strength, * who teacheth my hands to war,
      and my fingers to fight:<BR>
      2 My hope and my fortress, my castle and deliverer, my defender
      in whom I trust; * who subdueth my people that is under me.<BR>
      3 LORD, what is man, that thou hast such respect unto him? *
      or the son of man, that thou so regardest him?<BR>
      4 Man is like a thing of nought; * his time passeth away like
      a shadow.<BR>
      5 Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down; * touch the mountains,
      and they shall smoke.<BR>
      6 Cast forth thy lightning, and tear them; * shoot out thine
      arrows, and consume them.<BR>
      7 Send down thine hand from above; * deliver me, and take me
      out of the great waters, from the hand of strangers;<BR>
      8 Whose mouth talketh of vanity, * and their right hand is a
      right hand of wickedness.<BR>
      9 I will sing a new song unto thee, O God; * and sing praises
      unto thee upon a ten-stringed lute.<BR>
      10 Thou hast given victory unto kings, * and hast delivered David
      thy servant from the peril of the sword.<BR>
      11 Save me, and deliver me from the hand of strangers, * whose
      mouth talketh of vanity, and their right hand is a right hand
      of iniquity:<BR>
      12 That our sons may grow up as the young plants, * and that
      our daughters may be as the polished corners of the temple;<BR>
      13 That our garners may be full and plenteous with all manner
      of store; * that our sheep may bring forth thousands, and ten
      thousands in our fields;<BR>
      14 That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no decay,
      * no leading into captivity, and no complaining in our streets.<BR>
      15 Happy are the people that are in such a case; * yea, blessed
      are the people who have the LORD for their God.
