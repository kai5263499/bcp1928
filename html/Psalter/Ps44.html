      <P><B>Psalms 44. Deus, auribus.</B><BR>
      WE have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us
      * what thou hast done in their time of old:<BR>
      2 How thou hast driven out the heathen with thy hand, and planted
      our fathers in; * how thou hast destroyed the nations, and made
      thy people to flourish.<BR>
      3 For they gat not the land in possession through their own sword,
      * neither was it their own arm that helped them;<BR>
      4 But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance;
      * because thou hadst a favour unto them.<BR>
      5 Thou art my King, O God; * send help unto Jacob.<BR>
      6 Through thee will we overthrow our enemies, * and in thy Name
      will we tread them under that rise up against us.<BR>
      7 For I will not trust in my bow, * it is not my sword that shall
      help me;<BR>
      8 But it is thou that savest us from our enemies, * and puttest
      them to confusion that hate us.<BR>
      9 We make our boast of God all day long, * and will praise thy
      Name for ever.<BR>
      10 But now thou art far off, and puttest us to confusion, * and
      goest not forth with our armies.<BR>
      11 Thou makest us to turn our backs upon our enemies, * so that
      they which hate us spoil our goods.<BR>
      12 Thou lettest us be eaten up like sheep, * and hast scattered
      us among the heathen.<BR>
      13 Thou sellest thy people for nought, * and takest no money
      for them.<BR>
      14 Thou makest us to be rebuked of our neighbours, * to be laughed
      to scorn, and had in derision of them that are round about us.<BR>
      15 Thou makest us to be a by-word among the nations, * and that
      the peoples shake their heads at us.<BR>
      16 My confusion is daily before me, * and the shame of my face
      hath covered me;<BR>
      17 For the voice of the slanderer and blasphemer, * for the enemy
      and avenger.<BR>
      18 And though all this be come upon us, yet do we not forget
      thee, * nor behave ourselves frowardly in thy covenant.<BR>
      19 Our heart is not turned back, * neither our steps gone out
      of thy way;<BR>
      20 No, not when thou hast smitten us into the place of dragons,
      * and covered us with the shadow of death.<BR>
      21 If we have forgotten the Name of our God, and holden up our
      hands to any strange god, * shall not God search it out? for
      he knoweth the very secrets of the heart.<BR>
      22 For thy sake also are we killed all the day long, * and are
      counted as sheep appointed to be slain.<BR>
      23 Up, Lord, why sleepest thou? * awake, and be not absent from
      us for ever.<BR>
      24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, * and forgettest our misery
      and trouble?<BR>
      25 For our soul is brought low, even unto the dust; * our belly
      cleaveth unto the ground.<BR>
      26 Arise, and help us, * and deliver us, for thy mercy's sake.
