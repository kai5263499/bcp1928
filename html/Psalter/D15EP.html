    <p><strong>Psalm 78. Attendite, popule.</strong><br />
      HEAR my law, O my people; * incline your ears unto the words of my mouth.<br />
      2 I will open my mouth in a parable; * I will declare hard sentences of old;<br />
      3 Which we have heard and known, * and such as our fathers have told us;<br />
      4 That we should not hide them from the children of the generations to come; * but to show the honour of the LORD, his mighty and wonderful works that he hath done.<br />
      5 He made a covenant with Jacob, and gave Israel a law, * which he commanded our forefathers to teach their children;<br />
      6 That their posterity might know it, * and the children which were yet unborn;<br />
      7 To the intent that when they came up, * they might show their children the same;<br />
      8 That they might put their trust in God; * and not to forget the works of God, but to keep his commandments;<br />
      9 And not to be as their forefathers, a faithless and stubborn generation; * a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit clave not stedfastly unto God;<br />
      10 Like as the children of Ephraim; * who being harnessed, and carrying bows, turned themselves back in the day of battle.<br />
      11 They kept not the covenant of God, * and would not walk in his law;<br />
      12 But forgat what he had done, * and the wonderful works that he had showed for them.<br />
      13 Marvellous things did he in the sight of our forefathers, in the land of Egypt, * even in the field of Zoan.<br />
      14 He divided the sea, and let them go through; * he made the waters to stand on an heap.<br />
      15 In the day-time also he led them with a cloud, * and all the night through with a light of fire.<br />
      16 He clave the hard rocks in the wilderness, * and gave them drink thereof, as it had been out of the great depth.<br />
      17 He brought waters out of the stony rock, * so that it gushed out like the rivers.<br />
      18 Yet for all this they sinned more against him, * and provoked the Most Highest in the wilderness.<br />
      19 They tempted God in their hearts, * and required meat for their lust.<br />
      20 They spake against God also, saying, * Shall God prepare a table in the wilderness?<br />
      21 He smote the stony rock indeed, that the water gushed out, and the streams flowed withal; * but can he give bread also, or provide flesh for his people?<br />
      22 When the LORD heard this, he was wroth; * so the fire was kindled in Jacob, and there came up heavy displeasure against Israel;<br />
      23 Because they believed not in God, * and put not their trust in his help.<br />
      24 So he commanded the clouds above, * and opened the doors of heaven.<br />
      25 He rained down manna also upon them for to eat, * and gave them food from heaven.<br />
      26 So man did eat angels' food; * for he sent them meat enough.<br />
      27 He caused the east-wind to blow under heaven; * and through his power he brought in the southwest-wind.<br />
      28 He rained flesh upon them as thick as dust, * and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea.<br />
      29 He let it fall among their tents, * even round about their habitation.<br />
      30 So they did eat, and were well filled; for he gave them their own desire: * they were not disappointed of their lust.<br />
      31 But while the meat was yet in their mouths, the heavy wrath of God came upon them, and slew the wealthiest of them; * yea, and smote down the chosen men that were in Israel.<br />
      32 But for all this they sinned yet more, * and believed not his wondrous works.<br />
      33 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, * and their years in trouble.<br />
      34 When he slew them, they sought him, * and turned them early, and inquired after God.<br />
      35 And they remembered that God was their strength, * and that the High God was their redeemer.<br />
      36 Nevertheless, they did but flatter him with their mouth, * and dissembled with him in their tongue.<br />
      37 For their heart was not whole with him, * neither continued they stedfast in his covenant.<br />
      38 But he was so merciful, that he forgave their misdeeds, * and destroyed them not.<br />
      39 Yea, many a time turned he his wrath away, * and would not suffer his whole displeasure to arise.<br />
      40 For he considered that they were but flesh, * and that they were even a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.<br />
      41 Many a time did they provoke him in the wilderness, * and grieved him in the desert.<br />
      42 They turned back, and tempted God, * and provoked the Holy One in Israel.<br />
      43 They thought not of his hand, * and of the day when he delivered them from the hand of the enemy;<br />
      44 How he had wrought his miracles in Egypt, * and his wonders in the field of Zoan.<br />
      45 He turned their waters into blood, * so that they might not drink of the rivers.<br />
      46 He sent flies among them, and devoured them up; * and frogs to destroy them.<br />
      47 He gave their fruit unto the caterpillar, * and their labour unto the grasshopper.<br />
      48 He destroyed their vines with hailstones, * and their mulberry-trees with the frost.<br />
      49 He smote their cattle also with hailstones, * and their flocks with hot thunderbolts.<br />
      50 He cast upon them the furiousness of his wrath, anger, displeasure, and trouble: * and sent evil angels among them.<br />
      51 He made a way to his indignation, and spared not their soul from death; * but gave their life over to the pestilence;<br />
      52 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt, * the most principal and mightiest in the dwellings of Ham.<br />
      53 But as for his own people, he led them forth like sheep, * and carried them in the wilderness like a flock.<br />
      54 He brought them out safely, that they should not fear, * and overwhelmed their enemies with the sea.<br />
      55 And brought them within the borders of his sanctuary, * even to this mountain, which he purchased with his right hand.<br />
      56 He cast out the heathen also before them, * caused their land to be divided among them for an heritage, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.<br />
      57 Yet they tempted and displeased the Most High God, * and kept not his testimonies.<br />
      58 They turned their backs, and fell away like their forefathers; * starting aside like a broken bow.<br />
      59 For they grieved him with their hill-altars, * and provoked him to displeasure with their images.<br />
      60 When God heard this, he was wroth, * and took sore displeasure at Israel;<br />
      61 So that he forsook the tabernacle in Shiloh, * even the tent that he had pitched among men.<br />
      62 He delivered their power into captivity, * and their beauty into the enemy's hand<br />
      63 He gave his people over also unto the sword, * and was wroth with his inheritance.<br />
      64 The fire consumed their young men, * and their maidens were not given in marriage.<br />
      65 Their priests were slain with the sword, * and there were no widows to make lamentation.<br />
      66 So the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, * and like a giant refreshed with wine.<br />
      67 He drave his enemies backward, * and put them to a perpetual shame.<br />
      68 He refused the tabernacle of Joseph, * and chose not the tribe of Ephraim;<br />
      69 But chose the tribe of Judah, * even the hill of Sion which he loved.<br />
      70 And there he built his temple on high, * and laid the foundation of it like the ground which he hath made continually.<br />
      71 He chose David also his servant, * and took him away from the sheep-folds:<br />
      72 As he was following the ewes with their young he took him, * that he might feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.<br />
      73 So he fed them with a faithful and true heart, * and ruled them prudently with all his power.</p>
