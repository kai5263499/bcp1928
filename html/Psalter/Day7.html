      The Seventh Day.<BR>
<BR>
      Morning Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 35. Judica, Domine.</B><BR>
      PLEAD thou my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me, *
      and fight thou against them that fight against me.<BR>
      2 Lay hand upon the shield and buckler, * and stand up to help
      me.<BR>
      3 Bring forth the spear, and stop the way against them that pursue
      me: * say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.<BR>
      4 Let them be confounded, and put to shame, that seek after my
      soul; * let them be turned back, and brought to confusion, that
      imagine mischief for me.<BR>
      5 Let them be as the dust before the wind, * and the angel of
      the LORD scattering them.<BR>
      6 Let their way be dark and slippery, * and let the angel of
      the LORD pursue them.<BR>
      7 For they have privily laid their net to destroy me without
      a cause; * yea, even without a cause have they made a pit for
      my soul.<BR>
      8 Let a sudden destruction come upon him unawares, and his net
      that he hath laid privily catch himself; * that he may fall into
      his own mischief.<BR>
      9 And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD; * it shall rejoice
      in his salvation.<BR>
      10 All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, who deliverest
      the poor from him that is too strong for him; * yea, the poor,
      and him that is in misery, from him that spoileth him?<BR>
      11 False witnesses did rise up: * they laid to my charge things
      that I knew not.<BR>
      12 They rewarded me evil for good, * to the great discomfort
      of my soul.<BR>
      13 Nevertheless, when they were sick, I put on sackcloth, and
      humbled my soul with fasting; * and my prayer shall turn into
      mine own bosom.<BR>
      14 I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother;
      * I went heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.<BR>
      15 But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves
      together; * yea, the very abjects came together against me unawares,
      making mouths at me, and ceased not.<BR>
      16 With the flatterers were busy mockers, * who gnashed upon
      me with their teeth.<BR>
      17 Lord, how long wilt thou look upon this? * O deliver my soul
      from the calamities which they bring on me, and my darling from
      the lions.<BR>
      18 So will I give thee thanks in the great congregation; * I
      will praise thee among much people.<BR>
      19 O let not them that are mine enemies triumph over me ungodly;
      * neither let them wink with their eyes, that hate me without
      a cause.<BR>
      20 And why? their communing is not for peace; * but they imagine
      deceitful words against them that are quiet in the land.<BR>
      21 They gaped upon me with their mouths, and said, * Fie on thee!
      fie on thee! we saw it with our eyes.<BR>
      22 This thou hast seen, O LORD; * hold not thy tongue then; go
      not far from me, O Lord.<BR>
      23 Awake, and stand up to judge my quarrel; * avenge thou my
      cause, my God and my Lord.<BR>
      24 Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; *
      and let them not triumph over me.<BR>
      25 Let them not say in their hearts, There! there! so would we
      have it; * neither let them say, We have devoured him.<BR>
      26 Let them be put to confusion and shame together, that rejoice
      at my trouble; * let them be clothed with rebuke and dishonour,
      that boast themselves against me.<BR>
      27 Let them be glad and rejoice, that favour my righteous dealing;
      * yea, let them say alway, Blessed be the LORD, who hath pleasure
      in the prosperity of his servant.<BR>
      28 And as for my tongue, it shall be talking of thy righteousness,
      * and of thy praise, all the day long.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 36. Dixit injustus.</B><BR>
      MY heart showeth me the wickedness of the ungodly, * that there
      is no fear of God before his eyes.<BR>
      2 For he flattereth himself in his own sight, * until his abominable
      sin be found out.<BR>
      3 The words of his mouth are unrighteous and full of deceit:
      * he hath left off to behave himself wisely, and to do good.<BR>
      4 He imagineth mischief upon his bed, and hath set himself in
      no good way; * neither doth he abhor any thing that is evil.<BR>
      5 Thy mercy, O LORD, reacheth unto the' heavens, * and thy faithfulness
      unto the clouds.<BR>
      6 Thy righteousness standeth like the strong mountains: * thy
      judgments are like the great deep.<BR>
      7 Thou, LORD, shalt save both man and beast: how excellent is
      thy mercy, O God! * and the children of men shall put their trust
      under the shadow of thy wings.<BR>
      8 They shall be satisfied with the plenteousness of thy house;
      * and thou shalt give them drink of thy pleasures, as out of
      the river.<BR>
      9 For with thee is the well of life; * and in thy light shall
      we see light.<BR>
      10 O continue forth thy loving-kindness unto them that know thee,
      * and thy righteousness unto them that are true of heart.<BR>
      11 O let not the foot of pride come against me; * and let not
      the hand of the ungodly cast me down.<BR>
      12 There are they fallen, all that work wickedness; * they are
      cast down, and shall not be able to stand.<BR>

      <P><CENTER><A NAME="anchor493625"></A>Evening Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 37. Noli aemulari.</B><BR>
      FRET not thyself because of the ungodly; * neither be thou envious
      against the evil doers.<BR>
      2 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, * and be withered
      even as the green herb.<BR>
      3 Put thou thy trust in the LORD, and be doing good; * dwell
      in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.<BR>
      4 Delight thou in the LORD, * and he shall give thee thy heart's
      desire.<BR>
      5 Commit thy way unto the LORD, and put thy trust in him, * and
      he shall bring it to pass.<BR>
      6 He shall make thy righteousness as clear as the light, * and
      thy just dealing as the noon-day.<BR>
      7 Hold thee still in the LORD, and abide patiently upon him:
      * but grieve not thyself at him whose way doth prosper, against
      the man that doeth after evil counsels.<BR>
      8 Leave off from wrath, and let go displeasure: * fret not thyself,
      else shalt thou be moved to do evil.<BR>
      9 Wicked doers shall be rooted out; * and they that patiently
      abide the LORD, those shall inherit the land.<BR>
      10 Yet a little while, and the ungodly shall be clean gone: *
      thou shalt look after his place, and he shall be away.<BR>
      11 But the meek-spirited shall possess the earth, * and shall
      be refreshed in the multitude of peace.<BR>
      12 The ungodly seeketh counsel against the just, * and gnasheth
      upon him with his teeth.<BR>
      13 The Lord shall laugh him to-scorn; * for he hath seen that
      his day is coming.<BR>
      14 The ungodly have drawn out the sword, and have bent their
      bow, * to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be
      upright in their ways.<BR>
      15 Their sword shall go through their own heart, * and their
      bow shall be broken.<BR>
      16 A small thing that the righteous hath, * is better than great
      riches of the ungodly.<BR>
      17 For the arms of the ungodly shall be broken, * and the LORD
      upholdeth the righteous.<BR>
      18 The LORD knoweth the days of the godly; * and their inheritance
      shall endure for ever.<BR>
      19 They shall not be confounded in the perilous time; * and in
      the days of dearth they shall have enough.<BR>
      20 As for the ungodly, they shall perish, and the enemies of
      the LORD shall consume as the fat of lambs: * yea, even as the
      smoke shall they consume away.<BR>
      21 The ungodly borroweth, and payeth not again; * but the righteous
      is merciful and liberal.<BR>
      22 Such as are blessed of God, shall possess the land; * and
      they that are cursed of him, shall be rooted out.<BR>
      23 The LORD ordereth a good man's going, * and maketh his way
      acceptable to himself.<BR>
      24 Though he fall, he shall not be cast away; * for the LORD
      upholdeth him with his hand.<BR>
      25 I have been young, and now am old; * and yet saw I never the
      righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging their bread.<BR>
      26 The righteous is ever merciful, and lendeth; * and his seed
      is blessed.<BR>
      27 Flee from evil, and do the thing that is good; * and dwell
      for evermore.<BR>
      28 For the LORD loveth the thing that is right; * he forsaketh
      not his that be godly, but they are preserved for ever.<BR>
      29 The unrighteous shall be punished; * as for the seed of the
      ungodly, it shall be rooted out.<BR>
      30 The righteous shall inherit the land, * and dwell therein
      for ever.<BR>
      31 The mouth of the righteous is exercised in wisdom, * and his
      tongue will be talking of judgment.<BR>
      32 The law of his God is in his heart, * and his goings shall
      not slide.<BR>
      33 The ungodly watcheth the righteous, * and seeketh occasion
      to slay him.<BR>
      34 The LORD will not leave him in his hand, * nor condemn him
      when he is judged.<BR>
      35 Hope thou in the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall promote
      thee, that thou shalt possess the land: * when the ungodly shall
      perish, thou shalt see it.<BR>
      36 I myself have seen the ungodly in great power, * and flourishing
      like a green bay-tree.<BR>
      37 I went by, and lo, he was gone: * I sought him, but his place
      could no where be found.<BR>
      38 Keep innocency, and take heed unto the thing that is right;
      * for that shall bring a man peace at the last.<BR>
      39 As for the transgressors, they shall perish together; * and
      the end of the ungodly is, they shall be rooted out at the last.<BR>
      40 But the salvation of the righteous cometh of the LORD; * who
      is also their strength in the time of trouble.<BR>
      41 And the LORD shall stand by them, and save them: * he shall
      deliver them from the ungodly, and shall save them, because they
      put their trust in him.</P>
