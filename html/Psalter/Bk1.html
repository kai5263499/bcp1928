Beatus vir qui non abiit.</B><BR />BLESSED is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the
ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, * and hath not sat in
the seat of the scornful.<BR />2 But his delight is in the law of the LORD; * and in his law
will he exercise himself day and night.<BR />3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the water-side, * that
will bring forth his fruit in due season.<BR />4 His leaf also shall not wither; * and look, whatsoever he doeth,
it shall prosper.<BR />5 As for the ungodly, it is not so with them; * but they are like
the chaff, which the wind scattereth away from the face of the
earth.<BR />6 Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stand in the judgment,
* neither the sinners in the congregation of the righteous.<BR />7 But the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous; * and the way
of the ungodly shall perish.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 2. Quare fremuerunt gentes?</B><BR />WHY do the heathen so furiously rage together? * and why do the
people imagine a vain thing?<BR />2 The kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take counsel
together * against the LORD, and against his Anointed:<BR />3 Let us break their bonds asunder, * and cast away their cords
from us.<BR />4 He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh them to scorn: * the
Lord shall have them in derision.<BR />5 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, * and vex them in
his sore displeasure:<BR />6 Yet have I set my King * upon my holy hill of Sion.<BR />7 I will rehearse the decree; * the LORD hath said unto me, Thou
art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.<BR />8 Desire of me, and I shall give thee the nations for thine inheritance,
* and the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession.<BR />9 Thou shalt bruise them with a rod of iron, * and break them
in pieces like a potter's vessel.<BR />10 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings; * be instructed, ye that
are judges of the earth.<BR />11 Serve the LORD in fear, * and rejoice unto him with reverence.<BR />12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and so ye perish from the right
way, if his wrath be kindled, yea but a little. * Blessed are
all they that put their trust in him.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 3. Domine, quid multiplicati?</B><BR />LORD, how are they increased that trouble me! * many are they
that rise against me.<BR />2 Many one there be that say of my soul, * There is no help for
him in his God.<BR />3 But thou, O LORD, art my defender; * thou art my worship, and
the lifter up of my head.<BR />4 I did call upon the LORD with my voice, * and he heard me out
of his holy hill.<BR />5 I laid me down and slept, and rose up again; * for the LORD
sustained me.<BR />6 I will not be afraid for ten thousands of the people, * that
have set themselves against me round about.<BR />7 UP, LORD, and help me, O my God, * for thou smitest all mine
enemies upon the cheek-bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the
ungodly.<BR />8 Salvation belongeth unto the LORD; * and thy blessing is upon
thy people.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 4. Cum invocarem.</B><BR />HEAR me when I call, O God of my righteousness: * thou hast set
me at liberty when I was in trouble; have mercy upon me, and hearken
unto my prayer.<BR />2 O ye sons of men, how long will ye blaspheme mine honour, *
and have such pleasure in vanity, and seek after falsehood?<BR />3 Know this also, that the LORD hath chosen to himself the man
that is godly; * when I call upon the LORD he will hear me.<BR />4 Stand in awe, and sin not; * commune with your own heart, and
in your chamber, and be still.<BR />5 Offer the sacrifice of righteousness, * and put your trust in
the LORD.<BR />6 There be many that say, * Who will show us any good?<BR />7 LORD, lift thou up* the light of thy countenance upon us.<BR />8 Thou hast put gladness in my heart; * yea, more than when their
corn and wine and oil increase.<BR />9 I will lay me down in peace, and take my rest; * for it is thou,
LORD, only, that makest me dwell in safety.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 5. Verba mea auribus.</B><BR />PONDER my words, O LORD, * consider my meditation.<BR />2 O hearken thou unto the voice of my calling, my King and my
God: * for unto thee will I make my prayer.<BR />3 My voice shalt thou hear betimes, O LORD; * early in the morning
will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.<BR />4 For thou art the God that hast no pleasure in wickedness; *
neither shall any evil dwell with thee.<BR />5 Such as be foolish shall not stand in thy sight; * for thou
hatest all them that work iniquity.<BR />6 Thou shalt destroy them that speak lies: * the LORD will abhor
both the blood-thirsty and deceitful man.<BR />7 But as for me, in the multitude of thy mercy I will come into
thine house; * and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy
temple.<BR />8 Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness, because of mine enemies;
* make thy way plain before my face.<BR />9 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; * their inward
parts are very wickedness.<BR />10 Their throat is an open sepulchre; * they flatter with their
tongue.<BR />11 Destroy thou them, O God; let them perish through their own
imaginations; * cast them out in the multitude of their ungodliness;
for they have rebelled against thee.<BR />12 And let all them that put their trust in thee rejoice: * they
shall ever be giving of thanks, because thou defendest them; they
that love thy Name shall be joyful in thee;<BR />13 For thou, LORD, wilt give thy blessing unto the righteous,
* and with thy favourable kindness wilt thou defend him as with
a shield.<BR /><BR /></p><P><CENTER>Evening Prayer.</CENTER></p><P><B>Psalm 6. Domine, ne in furore.</B><BR />O LORD, rebuke me not in thine indignation, * neither chasten
me in thy displeasure.<BR />2 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am weak; * O LORD, heal me,
for my bones are vexed.<BR />3 My soul also is sore troubled: * but, LORD, how long wilt thou
punish me?<BR />4 Turn thee, O LORD, and deliver my soul; * O save me, for thy
mercy's sake.<BR />5 For in death no man remembereth thee; * and who will give thee
thanks in the pit?<BR />6 I am weary of my groaning; * every night wash I my bed, and
water my couch with my tears.<BR />7 My beauty is gone for very trouble, * and worn away because
of all mine enemies.<BR />8 Away from me, all ye that work iniquity; * for the LORD hath
heard the voice of my weeping.<BR />9 The LORD hath heard my petition; * the LORD will receive my
prayer.<BR />10 All mine enemies shall be confounded, and sore vexed; * they
shall be turned back, and put to shame suddenly.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 7. Domine, Deus meus.</B><BR />O LORD my God, in thee have I put my trust: * save me from all
them that persecute me, and deliver me;<BR />2 Lest he devour my soul like a lion, and tear it in pieces, *
while there is none to help.<BR />3 O LORD my God, if I have done any such thing; * or if there
be any wickedness in my hands;<BR />4 If I have rewarded evil unto him that dealt friendly with me;
* (yea, I have delivered him that without any cause is mine enemy;)<BR />5 Then let mine enemy persecute my soul, and take me; * yea, let
him tread my life down upon the earth, and lay mine honour in
the dust.<BR />6 Stand up, O LORD, in thy wrath, and lift up thyself, because
of the indignation of mine enemies; * arise up for me in the judgment
that thou hast commanded.<BR />7 And so shall the congregation of the peoples come about thee:
* for their sakes therefore lift up thyself again.<BR />8 The LORD shall judge the peoples: give sentence with me, O LORD,
* according to my righteousness, and according to the innocency
that is in me.<BR />9 O let the wickedness of the ungodly come to an end; * but guide
thou the just.<BR />10 For the righteous God * trieth the very hearts and reins.<BR />11 My help cometh of God, * who preserveth them that are true
of heart.<BR />12 God is a righteous Judge, strong, and patient; * and God is
provoked every day.<BR />13 If a man will not turn, he will whet his sword; * he hath bent
his bow, and made it ready.<BR />14 He hath prepared for him the instruments of death; * he ordaineth
his arrows against the persecutors.<BR />15 Behold, the ungodly travaileth with iniquity; * he hath conceived
mischief, and brought forth falsehood.<BR />16 He hath graven and digged up a pit, * and is fallen himself
into the destruction that he made for other.<BR />17 For his travail shall come upon his own head, * and his wickedness
shall fall on his own pate.<BR />18 I will give thanks unto the LORD, according to his righteousness;
* and I will praise the Name of the LORD Most High.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 8. Domine, Dominus noster.</B><BR />O LORD our Governor, how excellent is thy Name in all the world;
* thou that hast set thy glory above the heavens!<BR />2 Out of the mouth of very babes and sucklings hast thou ordained
strength, because of thine enemies, * that thou mightest still
the enemy and the avenger.<BR />3 When I consider thy heavens, even the work of thy fingers; *
the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained;<BR />4 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? * and the son of
man, that thou visitest him?<BR />5 Thou madest him lower than the angels, * to crown him with glory
and worship.<BR />6 Thou makest him to have dominion of the works of thy hands;
* and thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet:<BR />7 All sheep and oxen; * yea, and the beasts of the field;<BR />8 The fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea; * and whatsoever
walketh through the paths of the seas.<BR />9 O LORD our Governor, * how excellent is thy Name in all the
world!<BR /><BR /></p><P><CENTER>The Second Day.<BR /><BR />Morning Prayer.</CENTER></p><P><B>Psalm 9. Confitebor tibi.</B><BR />I WILL give thanks unto thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; * I
will speak of all thy marvellous works.<BR />2 I will be glad and rejoice in thee; * yea, my songs will I make
of thy Name, O thou Most Highest.<BR />3 While mine enemies are driven back, * they shall fall and perish
at thy presence.<BR />4 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; * thou art set
in the throne that judgest right.<BR />5 Thou hast rebuked the heathen, and destroyed the ungodly; *
thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.<BR />6 O thou enemy, thy destructions are come to a perpetual end;
* even as the cities which thou hast destroyed, whose memorial
is perished with them.<BR />7 But the LORD shall endure for ever; * he hath also prepared
his seat for judgment.<BR />8 For he shall judge the world in righteousness, * and minister
true judgment unto the people.<BR />9 The LORD also will be a defence for the oppressed, * even a
refuge in due time of trouble.<BR />10 And they that know thy Name will put their trust in thee; *
for thou, LORD, hast never failed them that seek thee.<BR />11 O praise the LORD which dwelleth in Sion; * show the people
of his doings.<BR />12 For when he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them,
* and forgetteth not the complaint of the poor.<BR />13 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider the trouble which I suffer
of them that hate me, * thou that liftest me up from the gates
of death;<BR />14 That I may show all thy praises within the gates of the daughter
of Sion: * I will rejoice in thy salvation.<BR />15 The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made; * in the
same net which they hid privily is their foot taken.<BR />16 The LORD is known to execute judgment; * the ungodly is trapped
in the work of his own hands.<BR />17 The wicked shall be turned to destruction, * and all the people
that forget God.<BR />18 For the poor shall not alway be forgotten; * the patient abiding
of the meek shall not perish for ever.<BR />19 UP, LORD, and let not man have the upper hand; * let the heathen
be judged in thy sight.<BR />20 Put them in fear, O LORD, * that the heathen may know themselves
to be but men.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 10. Ut quid, Domine ?</B><BR />WHY standest thou so far off, O LORD, * and hidest thy face in
the needful time of trouble?<BR />2 The ungodly, for his own lust, doth persecute the poor: * let
them be taken in the crafty wiliness that they have imagined.<BR />3 For the ungodly hath made boast of his own heart's desire, *
and speaketh good of the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.<BR />4 The ungodly is so proud, that he careth not for God, * neither
is God in all his thoughts.<BR />5 His ways are alway grievous; * thy judgments are far above out
of his sight, and therefore defieth he all his enemies.<BR />6 For he hath said in his heart, Tush, I shall never be cast down,
* there shall no harm happen unto me.<BR />7 His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and fraud; * under his
tongue is ungodliness and vanity.<BR />8 He sitteth lurking in the thievish corners of the streets, *
and privily in his lurking dens doth he murder the innocent; his
eyes are set against the poor.<BR />9 For he lieth waiting secretly; even as a lion lurketh he in
his den, * that he may ravish the poor.<BR />10 He doth ravish the poor, * when he getteth him into his net.<BR />11 He falleth down, and humbleth himself, * that the congregation
of the poor may fall into the hands of his captains.<BR />12 He hath said in his heart, Tush, God hath forgotten; * he hideth
away his face, and he will never see it.<BR />13 Arise, O LORD God, and lift up thine hand; * forget not the
poor.<BR />14 Wherefore should the wicked blaspheme God, * while he doth
say in his heart, Tush, thou God carest not for it?<BR />15 Surely thou hast seen it; * for thou beholdest ungodliness
and wrong, that thou mayest take the matter into thy hand.<BR />16 The poor committeth himself unto thee; * for thou art the helper
of the friendless.<BR />17 Break thou the power of the ungodly and malicious; * search
out his ungodliness, until thou find none.<BR />18 The LORD is King for ever and ever, * and the heathen are perished
out of the land.<BR />19 LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the poor; * thou preparest
their heart, and thine ear hearkeneth;<BR />20 To help the fatherless and poor unto their right, * that the
man of the earth be no more exalted against them.<BR /><B><BR />Psalm 11. In Domino confido.</B><BR />IN the LORD put I my trust; * how say ye then to my soul, that
she should flee as a bird unto the hill?<BR />2 For lo, the ungodly bend their bow, and make ready their arrows
within the quiver, * that they may privily shoot at them which
are true of heart.<BR />3 If the foundations be destroyed, * what can the righteous do?<BR />4 The LORD is in his holy temple; * the LORD'S seat is in heaven.<BR />5 His eyes consider the poor, * and his eyelids try the children
of men.<BR />6 The LORD approveth the righteous: * but the ungodly, and him
that delighteth in wickedness, doth his soul abhor.<BR />7 Upon the ungodly he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, storm
and tempest: * this shall be their portion to drink.<BR />8 For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; * his countenance
will behold the thing that is just.<BR /></p><P><CENTER>Evening Prayer.</CENTER></p><P><B>Psalm 12. Salvum me fac.</B><BR />HELP me, LORD, for there is not one godly man left; * for the
faithful are minished from among the children of men.<BR />2 They talk of vanity every one with his neighbour; * they do
but flatter with their lips, and dissemble in their double heart.<BR />3 The LORD shall root out all deceitful lips, * and the tongue
that speaketh proud things;<BR />4 Which have said, With our tongue will we prevail; * we are they
that ought to speak; who is lord over us?<BR />5 Now, for the comfortless troubles' sake of the needy, * and
because of the deep sighing of the poor,<BR />6 I will up, saith the LORD; * and will help every one from him
that swelleth against him, and will set him at rest.<BR />7 The words of the LORD are pure words; * even as the silver which
from the earth is tried, and purified seven times in the fire.<BR />8 Thou shalt keep them, O LORD; * thou shalt preserve them from
this generation for ever.<BR />9 The ungodly walk on every side: * when they are exalted, the
children of men are put to rebuke.<BR /><B><BR />Psalm 13. Usquequo, Domine?</B><BR />HOW long wilt thou forget me, O LORD; for ever? * how long wilt
thou hide thy face from me?<BR />2 How long shall I seek counsel in my soul, and be so vexed in
my heart? * how long shall mine enemy triumph over me?<BR />3 Consider, and hear me, O LORD my God; * lighten mine eyes, that
I sleep not in death;<BR />4 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him: * for if
I be cast down, they that trouble me will rejoice at it.<BR />5 But my trust is in thy mercy, * and my heart is joyful in thy
salvation.<BR />6 I will sing of the LORD, because he hath dealt so lovingly with
me; * yea, I will praise the Name of the Lord Most Highest.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 14. Dixit insipiens.</B><BR />THE fool hath said in his heart, * There is no God.<BR />2 They are corrupt, and become abominable in their doings; * there
is none that doeth good, no not one.<BR />3 The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, *
to see if there were any that would understand, and seek after
God.<BR />4 But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become
abominable; * there is none that doeth good, no not one.<BR />5 Have they no knowledge, that they are all such workers of mischief,
* eating up my people as it were bread, and call not upon the
LORD?<BR />6 There were they brought in great fear, even where no fear was;
* for God is in the generation of the righteous.<BR />7 As for you, ye have made a mock at the counsel of the poor;
* because he putteth his trust in the LORD.<BR />8 Who shall give salvation unto Israel out of Sion? * When the
LORD turneth the captivity of his people, then shall Jacob rejoice,
and Israel shall be glad.<BR /></p><P><CENTER>The Third Day.<BR />Morning Prayer.</CENTER></p><P><B>Psalm 15. Domine, quis habitabit?</B><BR />LORD, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? * or who shall rest upon
thy holy hill?<BR />2 Even he that leadeth an uncorrupt life, * and doeth the thing
which is right, and speaketh the truth from his heart.<BR />3 He that hath used no deceit in his tongue, nor done evil to
his neighbour, * and hath not slandered his neighbour.<BR />4 He that setteth not by himself, but is lowly in his own eyes,
* and maketh much of them that fear the LORD.<BR />5 He that sweareth unto his neighbour, and disappointeth him not,
* though it were to his own hindrance.<BR />6 He that hath not given his money upon usury, * nor taken reward
against the innocent.<BR />7 Whoso doeth these things * shall never fall.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 16. Conserva me, Domine.</B><BR />PRESERVE me, O God; * for in thee have I put my trust.<BR />2 O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, * Thou art my God;
I have no good like unto thee.<BR />3 All my delight is upon the saints that are in the earth, * and
upon such as excel in virtue.<BR />4 But they that run after another god * shall have great trouble.<BR />5 Their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, * neither make
mention of their names within my lips.<BR />6 The LORD himself is the portion of mine inheritance, and of
my cup; * thou shalt maintain my lot.<BR />7 The lot is fallen unto me in a fair ground; * yea, I have a
goodly heritage.<BR />8 I will thank the LORD for giving me warning; * my reins also
chasten me in the night season.<BR />9 I have set the LORD alway before me; * for he is on my right
hand, therefore I shall not fall.<BR />10 Wherefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: * my flesh
also shall rest in hope.<BR />11 For why? thou shalt not leave my soul in hell; * neither shalt
thou suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.<BR />12 Thou shalt show me the path of life: in thy presence is the
fulness of joy, * and at thy right hand there is pleasure for
evermore.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 17. Exaudi, Domine.</B><BR />HEAR the right, O LORD, consider my complaint, * and hearken unto
my prayer, that goeth not out-of feigned lips.<BR />2 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; * and let thine
eyes look upon the thing that is equal.<BR />3 Thou hast proved and visited mine heart in the night season;
thou hast tried me, and shalt find no wickedness in me; * for
I am utterly purposed that my mouth shall not offend.<BR />4 As for the works of men, * by the word of thy lips I have kept
me from the ways of the destroyer.<BR />5 O hold thou up my goings in thy paths, * that my footsteps slip
not.<BR />6 I have called upon thee, O God, for thou shalt hear me: * incline
thine ear to me, and hearken unto my words.<BR />7 Show thy marvellous loving-kindness, thou that art the Saviour
of them which put their trust in thee, * from such as resist thy
right hand.<BR />8 Keep me as the apple of an eye; * hide me under the shadow of
thy wings,<BR />9 From the ungodly, that trouble me; * mine enemies compass me
round about, to take away my soul.<BR />10 They are inclosed in their own fat, * and their mouth speaketh
proud things.<BR />11 They lie waiting in our way on every side, * watching to cast
us down to the ground;<BR />12 Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, * and as it were
a lion's whelp lurking in secret places.<BR />13 Up, LORD, disappoint him, and cast him down; * deliver my soul
from the ungodly, by thine own sword;<BR />14 Yea, by thy hand, O LORD; from the men of the evil world; *
which have their portion in this life, whose bellies thou fillest
with thy hid treasure.<BR />15 They have children at their desire, * and leave the rest of
their substance for their babes.<BR />16 But as for me, I shall behold thy presence in righteousness;
* and when I awake up after thy likeness, I shall be satisfied.<BR /></p><P><CENTER>Evening Prayer.</CENTER></p><P><B>Psalm 18. Diligam te, Domine.</B><BR />I WILL love thee, O LORD, my strength. * The LORD is my stony
rock, and my defence;<BR />2 My Saviour, my God, and my might, in whom I will trust; * my
buckler, the horn also of my salvation, and my refuge.<BR />3 I will call upon the LORD, which is worthy to be praised; *
so shall I be safe from mine enemies.<BR />4 The sorrows of death compassed me, * and the overflowings of
ungodliness made me afraid.<BR />5 The pains of hell came about me; * the snares of death overtook
me.<BR />6 In my trouble I called upon the LORD, * and complained unto
my God:<BR />7 So he heard my voice out of his holy temple, * and my complaint
came before him; it entered even into his ears.<BR />8 The earth trembled and quaked, * the very foundations also of
the hills shook, and were removed, because he was wroth.<BR />9 There went a smoke out in his presence, * and a consuming fire
out of his mouth, so that coals were kindled at it.<BR />10 He bowed the heavens also, and came down, * and it was dark
under his feet.<BR />11 He rode upon the Cherubim, and did fly; * he came flying upon
the wings of the wind.<BR />12 He made darkness his secret place, * his pavilion round about
him with dark water, and thick clouds to cover him.<BR />13 At the brightness of his presence his clouds removed; * hailstones
and coals of fire.<BR />14 The LORD also thundered out of heaven, and the Highest gave
his thunder; * hailstones and coals of fire.<BR />15 He sent out his arrows, and scattered them; * he cast forth
lightnings, and destroyed them.<BR />16 The springs of waters were seen, and the foundations of the
round world were discovered, * at thy chiding, O LORD, at the
blasting of the breath of thy displeasure.<BR />17 He sent down from on high to fetch me, * and took me out of
many waters.<BR />18 He delivered me from my strongest enemy, and from them which
hate me; * for they were too mighty for me.<BR />19 They came upon me in the day of my trouble; * but the LORD
was my upholder.<BR />20 He brought me forth also into a place of liberty; * he brought
me forth, even because he had a favour unto me.<BR />21 The LORD rewarded me after my righteous dealing, * according
to the cleanness of my hands did he recompense me.<BR />22 Because I have kept the ways of the LORD, * and have not forsaken
my God, as the wicked doth.<BR />23 For I have an eye unto all his laws, * and will not cast out
his commandments from me.<BR />24 I was also uncorrupt before him, * and eschewed mine own wickedness.<BR />25 Therefore the LORD rewarded me after my righteous dealing,
* and according unto the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.<BR />26 With the holy thou shalt be holy, * and with a perfect man
thou shalt be perfect.<BR />27 With the clean thou shalt be clean, * and with the froward
thou shalt be froward.<BR />28 For thou shalt save the people that are in adversity, and shalt
bring down the high looks of the proud.<BR />29 Thou also shalt light my candle; * the LORD my God shall make
my darkness to be light.<BR />30 For in thee I shall discomfit an host of men, * and with the
help of my God I shall leap over the wall.<BR />31 The way of God is an undefiled way: * the word of the LORD
also is tried in the fire; he is the defender of all them that
put their trust in him.<BR />32 For who is God, but the LORD? * or who hath any strength, except
our God?<BR />33 It is God that girdeth me with strength of war, * and maketh
my way perfect.<BR />34 He maketh my feet like harts' feet, * and setteth me up on
high.<BR />35 He teacheth mine hands to fight, * and mine arms shall bend
even a bow of steel.<BR />36 Thou hast given me the defence of thy salvation; * thy right
hand also shall hold me up, and thy loving correction shall make
me great.<BR />37 Thou shalt make room enough under me for to go, * that my footsteps
shall not slide.<BR />38 I will follow upon mine enemies, and overtake them; * neither
will I turn again till I have destroyed them.<BR />39 I will smite them, that they shall not be able to stand, *
but fall under my feet.<BR />40 Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle; * thou shalt
throw down mine enemies under me.<BR />41 Thou hast made mine enemies also to turn their backs upon me,
* and I shall destroy them that hate me.<BR />42 They shall cry, but there shall be none to help them; * yea,
even unto the LORD shall they cry, but he shall not hear them.<BR />43 I will beat them as small as the dust before the wind: * I
will cast them out as the clay in the streets.<BR />44 Thou shalt deliver me from the strivings of the people, * and
thou shalt make me the head of the nations; a people whom I have
not known shall serve me.<BR />45 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me; * the strangers
shall feign obedience unto me.<BR />46 The strangers shall fail, * and come trembling out of their
strongholds.<BR />47 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my strong helper, * and praised
be the God of my salvation;<BR />48 Even the God that seeth that I be avenged, * and subdueth the
people unto me.<BR />49 It is he that delivereth me from my cruel enemies, and setteth
me up above mine adversaries: * thou shalt rid me from the wicked
man.<BR />50 For this cause will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among
the Gentiles, * and sing praises unto thy Name.<BR />51 Great prosperity giveth he unto his King, * and showeth loving-kindness
unto David his anointed, and unto his seed for evermore.<BR /></p><P><CENTER>The Fourth Day.<BR />Morning Prayer.</CENTER></p><P><B>Psalm 19. Caeli enarrant.</B><BR />THE heavens declare the glory of God; * and the firmament showeth

the commandment of the LORD is pure, and giveth light unto the

* yea, let them say alway, Blessed be the LORD, who hath pleasure
in the prosperity of his servant.<BR />28 And as for my tongue, it shall be talking of thy righteousness,
* and of thy praise, all the day long.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 36. Dixit injustus.</B><BR />MY heart showeth me the wickedness of the ungodly, * that there
is no fear of God before his eyes.<BR />2 For he flattereth himself in his own sight, * until his abominable
sin be found out.<BR />3 The words of his mouth are unrighteous and full of deceit: *
he hath left off to behave himself wisely, and to do good.<BR />4 He imagineth mischief upon his bed, and hath set himself in
no good way; * neither doth he abhor any thing that is evil.<BR />5 Thy mercy, O LORD, reacheth unto the' heavens, * and thy faithfulness
unto the clouds.<BR />6 Thy righteousness standeth like the strong mountains: * thy
judgments are like the great deep.<BR />7 Thou, LORD, shalt save both man and beast: how excellent is
thy mercy, O God! * and the children of men shall put their trust
under the shadow of thy wings.<BR />8 They shall be satisfied with the plenteousness of thy house;
* and thou shalt give them drink of thy pleasures, as out of the
river.<BR />9 For with thee is the well of life; * and in thy light shall
we see light.<BR />10 O continue forth thy loving-kindness unto them that know thee,
* and thy righteousness unto them that are true of heart.<BR />11 O let not the foot of pride come against me; * and let not
the hand of the ungodly cast me down.<BR />12 There are they fallen, all that work wickedness; * they are
cast down, and shall not be able to stand.<BR /></p><P><CENTER>Evening Prayer.</CENTER></p><P><B>Psalm 37. Noli aemulari.</B><BR />FRET not thyself because of the ungodly; * neither be thou envious
against the evil doers.<BR />2 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, * and be withered
even as the green herb.<BR />3 Put thou thy trust in the LORD, and be doing good; * dwell in
the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.<BR />4 Delight thou in the LORD, * and he shall give thee thy heart's
desire.<BR />5 Commit thy way unto the LORD, and put thy trust in him, * and
he shall bring it to pass.<BR />6 He shall make thy righteousness as clear as the light, * and
thy just dealing as the noon-day.<BR />7 Hold thee still in the LORD, and abide patiently upon him: *
but grieve not thyself at him whose way doth prosper, against
the man that doeth after evil counsels.<BR />8 Leave off from wrath, and let go displeasure: * fret not thyself,
else shalt thou be moved to do evil.<BR />9 Wicked doers shall be rooted out; * and they that patiently
abide the LORD, those shall inherit the land.<BR />10 Yet a little while, and the ungodly shall be clean gone: *
thou shalt look after his place, and he shall be away.<BR />11 But the meek-spirited shall possess the earth, * and shall
be refreshed in the multitude of peace.<BR />12 The ungodly seeketh counsel against the just, * and gnasheth
upon him with his teeth.<BR />13 The Lord shall laugh him to-scorn; * for he hath seen that
his day is coming.<BR />14 The ungodly have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow,
* to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be upright
in their ways.<BR />15 Their sword shall go through their own heart, * and their bow
shall be broken.<BR />16 A small thing that the righteous hath, * is better than great
riches of the ungodly.<BR />17 For the arms of the ungodly shall be broken, * and the LORD
upholdeth the righteous.<BR />18 The LORD knoweth the days of the godly; * and their inheritance
shall endure for ever.<BR />19 They shall not be confounded in the perilous time; * and in
the days of dearth they shall have enough.<BR />20 As for the ungodly, they shall perish, and the enemies of the
LORD shall consume as the fat of lambs: * yea, even as the smoke
shall they consume away.<BR />21 The ungodly borroweth, and payeth not again; * but the righteous
is merciful and liberal.<BR />22 Such as are blessed of God, shall possess the land; * and they
that are cursed of him, shall be rooted out.<BR />23 The LORD ordereth a good man's going, * and maketh his way
acceptable to himself.<BR />24 Though he fall, he shall not be cast away; * for the LORD upholdeth
him with his hand.<BR />25 I have been young, and now am old; * and yet saw I never the
righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging their bread.<BR />26 The righteous is ever merciful, and lendeth; * and his seed
is blessed.<BR />27 Flee from evil, and do the thing that is good; * and dwell
for evermore.<BR />28 For the LORD loveth the thing that is right; * he forsaketh
not his that be godly, but they are preserved for ever.<BR />29 The unrighteous shall be punished; * as for the seed of the
ungodly, it shall be rooted out.<BR />30 The righteous shall inherit the land, * and dwell therein for
ever.<BR />31 The mouth of the righteous is exercised in wisdom, * and his
tongue will be talking of judgment.<BR />32 The law of his God is in his heart, * and his goings shall
not slide.<BR />33 The ungodly watcheth the righteous, * and seeketh occasion
to slay him.<BR />34 The LORD will not leave him in his hand, * nor condemn him
when he is judged.<BR />35 Hope thou in the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall promote
thee, that thou shalt possess the land: * when the ungodly shall
perish, thou shalt see it.<BR />36 I myself have seen the ungodly in great power, * and flourishing
like a green bay-tree.<BR />37 I went by, and lo, he was gone: * I sought him, but his place
could no where be found.<BR />38 Keep innocency, and take heed unto the thing that is right;
* for that shall bring a man peace at the last.<BR />39 As for the transgressors, they shall perish together; * and
the end of the ungodly is, they shall be rooted out at the last.<BR />40 But the salvation of the righteous cometh of the LORD; * who
is also their strength in the time of trouble.<BR />41 And the LORD shall stand by them, and save them: * he shall
deliver them from the ungodly, and shall save them, because they
put their trust in him.<BR /></p><P><CENTER>Morning Prayer.</CENTER></p><P><B>Psalm 38. Domine, ne in furore.</B><BR />PUT me not to rebuke, O LORD, in thine anger; * neither chasten
me in thy heavy displeasure:<BR />2 For thine arrows stick fast in me, * and thy hand presseth me
sore.<BR />3 There is no health in my flesh, because of thy displeasure;
* neither is there any rest in my bones, by reason of my sin.<BR />4 For my wickednesses are gone over my head, * and are like a
sore burden, too heavy for me to bear.<BR />5 My wounds stink, and are corrupt, * through my foolishness.<BR />6 I am brought into so great trouble and misery, * that I go mourning
all the day long.<BR />7 For my loins are filled with a sore disease, * and there is
no whole part in my body.<BR />8 I am feeble and sore smitten; * I have roared for the very disquietness
of my heart.<BR />9 Lord, thou knowest all my desire; * and my groaning is not hid
from thee.<BR />10 My heart panteth, my strength hath failed me, * and the light
of mine eyes is gone from me.<BR />11 My lovers and my neighbours did stand looking upon my trouble,
* and my kinsmen stood afar off.<BR />12 They also that sought after my life laid snares for me; * and
they that went about to do me evil talked of wickedness, and imagined
deceit all the day long.<BR />13 As for me, I was like a deaf man, and heard not; * and as one
that is dumb, who doth not open his mouth.<BR />14 I became even as a man that heareth not, * and in whose mouth
are no reproofs.<BR />15 For in thee, O LORD, have I put my trust; * thou shalt answer
for me, O Lord my God.<BR />16 I have required that they, even mine enemies, should not triumph
over me; * for when my foot slipt, they rejoiced greatly against
me.<BR />17 And I truly am set in the plague, * and my heaviness is ever
in my sight.<BR />18 For I will confess my wickedness, * and be sorry for my sin.<BR />19 But mine enemies live, and are mighty; * and they that hate
me wrongfully are many in number.<BR />20 They also that reward evil for good are against me; * because
I follow the thing that good is.<BR />21 Forsake me not, O LORD my God; * be not thou far from me.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 39. Dixi, Custodiam.</B><BR />I SAID, I will take heed to my ways, * that I offend not in my
tongue<BR />2 I will keep my mouth as it were with a bridle, * while the ungodly
is in my sight.<BR />3 I held my tongue, and spake nothing: * I kept silence, yea,
even from good words; but it was pain and grief to me.<BR />4 My heart was hot within me: and while I was thus musing the
fire kindled, * and at the last I spake with my tongue:<BR />5 LORD, let me know mine end, and the number of my days; * that
I may be certified how long I have to live.<BR />6 Behold, thou hast made my days as it were a span long, and mine
age is even as nothing in respect of thee; * and verily every
man living is altogether vanity.<BR />7 For man walketh in a vain shadow, and disquieteth himself in
vain; * he heapeth up riches, and cannot tell who shall gather
them.<BR />8 And now, Lord, what is my hope? * truly my hope is even in thee.<BR />9 Deliver me from all mine offences; * and make me not a rebuke
unto the foolish.<BR />10 I became dumb, and opened not my mouth; * for it was thy doing.<BR />11 Take thy plague away from me: * I am even consumed by the means
of thy heavy hand.<BR />12 When thou with rebukes dost chasten man for sin, thou makest
his beauty to consume away, like as it were a moth fretting a
garment: * every man therefore is but vanity.<BR />13 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and with thine ears consider my calling;
* hold not thy peace at my tears;<BR />14 For I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, * as all my
fathers were.<BR />15 O spare me a little, that I may recover my strength, * before
I go hence, and be no more seen.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 40. Expectans expectavi.</B><BR />I WAITED patiently for the LORD, * and he inclined unto me, and
heard my calling.<BR />2 He brought me also out of the horrible pit, out of the mire
and clay, * and set my feet upon the rock, and ordered my goings.<BR />3 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, * even a thanksgiving
unto our God.<BR />4 Many shall see it, and fear, * and shall put their trust in
the LORD.<BR />5 Blessed is the man that hath set his hope in the LORD, * and
turned not unto the proud, and to such as go about with lies.<BR />6 O LORD my God, great are the wondrous works which thou hast
done, like as be also thy thoughts, which are to us-ward; * and
yet there is no man that ordereth them unto thee.<BR />7 If I should declare them, and speak of them, * they should be
more than I am able to express.<BR />8 Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, * but mine ears hast
thou opened.<BR />9 Burnt-offering and sacrifice for sin hast thou not required:
* then said I, LO, I come;<BR />10 In the volume of the book it is written of me, that I should
fulfil thy will, O my God: * I am content to do it; yea, thy law
is within my heart.<BR />11 I have declared thy righteousness in the great congregation:
* lo, I will not refrain my lips, O LORD, and that thou knowest.<BR />12 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; * my talk
hath been of thy truth, and of thy salvation.<BR />13 I have not kept back thy loving mercy and truth * from the
great congregation.<BR />14 Withdraw not thou thy mercy from me, O LORD; * let thy loving-kindness
and thy truth alway preserve me.<BR />15 For innumerable troubles are come about me; my sins have taken
such hold upon me, that I am not able to look up; * yea, they
are more in number than the hairs of my head, and my heart hath
failed me.<BR />16 O LORD, let it be thy pleasure to deliver me; * make haste,
O LORD, to help me.<BR />17 Let them be ashamed, and confounded together, that seek after
my soul to destroy it; * let them be driven backward, and put
to rebuke, that wish me evil.<BR />18 Let them be desolate, and rewarded with shame, * that say unto
me, Fie upon thee! fie upon thee!<BR />19 Let all those that seek thee, be joyful and glad in thee; *
and let such as love thy salvation, say alway, The LORD be praised.<BR />20 As for me, I am poor and needy; * but the Lord careth for me.<BR />21 Thou art my helper and redeemer; * make no long tarrying, O
my God.<BR /></p><P><CENTER>Evening Prayer.</CENTER></p><P><B>Psalm 41. Beatus qui intelligit.</B><BR />BLESSED is he that considereth the poor and needy; * the LORD
shall deliver him in the time of trouble.<BR />2 The LORD preserve him, and keep him alive, that he may be blessed
upon earth; * and deliver not thou him into the will of his enemies.<BR />3 The LORD comfort him when he lieth sick upon his bed; * make
thou all his bed in his sickness.<BR />4 I said, LORD, be merciful unto me; * heal my soul, for I have
sinned against thee.<BR />5 Mine enemies speak evil of me, * When shall he die, and his
name perish?<BR />6 And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity, * and his heart
conceiveth falsehood within himself; and when he cometh forth,
he telleth it.<BR />7 All mine enemies whisper together against me; * even against
me do they imagine this evil.<BR />8 An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him; * and now
that he lieth, he shall rise up no more.<BR />9 Yea, even mine own familiar friend whom I trusted, * who did
also eat of my bread, hath laid great wait for me.<BR />10 But be thou merciful unto me, O LORD; * raise thou me up again,
and I shall reward them.<BR />11 By this I know thou favourest me, * that mine enemy doth not
triumph against me.<BR />12 And in my innocency thou upholdest me, * and shalt set me before
thy face for ever.<BR />13 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, * world without end. Amen.</P><H6><CENTER>Go to <A HREF="../index.html">1928 Book of Common
