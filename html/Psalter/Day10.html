      The Tenth Day.<BR>
<BR>
      Morning Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 50. Deus deorum.</B><BR>
      THE LORD, even the Most Mighty God, hath spoken, * and called
      the world, from the rising up of the sun unto the going down
      thereof.<BR>
      2 Out of Sion hath God appeared * in perfect beauty.<BR>
      3 Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence; * there shall
      go before him a consuming fire, and a mighty tempest shall be
      stirred up round about him.<BR>
      4 He shall call the heaven from above, * and the earth, that
      he may judge his people.<BR>
      5 Gather my saints together unto me; * those that have made a
      covenant with me with sacrifice.<BR>
      6 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness; * for God
      is Judge himself.<BR>
      7 Hear, O my people, and I will speak; * I myself will testify
      against thee, O Israel; for I am God, even thy God.<BR>
      8 I will not reprove thee because of thy sacrifices; * as for
      thy burnt-offerings, they are alway before me.<BR>
      9 I will take no bullock out of thine house, * nor he-goats out
      of thy folds.<BR>
      10 For all the beasts of the forest are mine, * and so are the
      cattle upon a thousand hills.<BR>
      11 I know all the fowls upon the mountains, * and the wild beasts
      of the field are in my sight.<BR>
      12 If I be hungry, I will not tell thee; * for the whole world
      is mine, and all that is therein.<BR>
      13 Thinkest thou that I will eat bulls' flesh, * and drink the
      blood of goats?<BR>
      14 Offer unto God thanksgiving, * and pay thy vows unto the Most
      Highest.<BR>
      15 And call upon me in the time of trouble; * so will I hear
      thee, and thou shalt praise me.<BR>
      16 But unto the ungodly saith God, * Why dost thou preach my
      laws, and takest my covenant in thy mouth;<BR>
      17 Whereas thou hatest to be reformed, * and hast cast my words
      behind thee?<BR>
      18 When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst unto him; * and
      hast been partaker with the adulterers.<BR>
      19 Thou hast let thy mouth speak wickedness, * and with thy tongue
      thou hast set forth deceit.<BR>
      20 Thou sattest and spakest against thy brother; * yea, and hast
      slandered thine own mother's son.<BR>
      21 These things hast thou done, and I held my tongue, and thou
      thoughtest wickedly, that I am even such a one as thyself; *
      but I will reprove thee, and set before thee the things that
      thou hast done.<BR>
      22 O consider this, ye that forget God, * lest I pluck you away,
      and there be none to deliver you.<BR>
      23 Whoso offereth me thanks and praise, he honoureth me; * and
      to him that ordereth his way aright, will I show the salvation
      of God.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 51. Miserere mei, Deus.</B><BR>
      HAVE mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness; * according
      to the multitude of thy mercies do away mine offences.<BR>
      2 Wash me throughly from my wickedness, * and cleanse me from
      my sin.<BR>
      3 For I acknowledge my faults, * and my sin is ever before me.<BR>
      4 Against thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy
      sight; * that thou mightest be justified in thy saying, and clear
      when thou shalt judge.<BR>
      5 Behold, I was shapen in wickedness, * and in sin hath my mother
      conceived me.<BR>
      6 But lo, thou requirest truth in the inward parts, * and shalt
      make me to understand wisdom secretly.<BR>
      7 Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; * thou
      shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.<BR>
      8 Thou shalt make me hear of joy and gladness, * that the bones
      which thou hast broken may rejoice.<BR>
      9 Turn thy face from my sins, * and put out all my misdeeds.<BR>
      10 Make me a clean heart, O God, * and renew a right spirit within
      me.<BR>
      11 Cast me not away from thy presence, * and take not thy holy
      Spirit from me.<BR>
      12 O give me the comfort of thy help again, * and stablish me
      with thy free Spirit.<BR>
      13 Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked, * and sinners
      shall be converted unto thee.<BR>
      14 Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou that art the
      God of my health; * and my tongue shall sing of thy righteousness.<BR>
      15 Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord, * and my mouth shall show
      thy praise.<BR>
      16 For thou desirest no sacrifice, else would I give it thee;
      * but thou delightest not in burnt-offerings.<BR>
      17 The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit: * a broken and
      contrite heart, O God, shalt thou not despise.<BR>
      18 O be favourable and gracious unto Sion; * build thou the walls
      of Jerusalem.<BR>
      19 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness,
      with the burnt-offerings and oblations; * then shall they offer
      young bullocks upon thine altar.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 52. Quid gloriaris?</B><BR>
      WHY boastest thou thyself, thou tyrant, * that thou canst do
      mischief;<BR>
      2 Whereas the goodness of God * endureth yet daily?<BR>
      3 Thy tongue imagineth wickedness, * and with lies thou cuttest
      like a sharp razor.<BR>
      4 Thou hast loved unrighteousness more than goodness, * and falsehood
      more than righteousness.<BR>
      5 Thou hast loved to speak all words that may do hurt, * O thou
      false tongue.<BR>
      6 Therefore shall God destroy thee for ever; * he shall take
      thee, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling, and root thee out of
      the land of the living.<BR>
      7 The righteous also shall see this, and fear, * and shall laugh
      him to scorn:<BR>
      8 Lo, this is the man that took not God for his strength; * but
      trusted unto the multitude of his riches, and strengthened himself
      in his wickedness.<BR>
      9 As for me, I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God;
      * my trust is in the tender mercy of God for ever and ever.<BR>
      10 I will alway give thanks unto thee for that thou hast done;
      * and I will hope in thy Name, for thy saints like it well.<BR>

      <P><CENTER><A NAME="anchor433620"></A>Evening Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 53. Dixit insipiens.</B><BR>
      THE foolish body hath said in his heart, * There is no God.<BR>
      2 Corrupt are they, and become abominable in their wickedness;
      * there is none that doeth good.<BR>
      3 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, * to
      see if there were any that would understand, and seek after God.<BR>
      4 But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become
      abominable; * there is also none that doeth good, no not one.<BR>
      5 Are not they without understanding that work wickedness, *
      eating up my people as if they would eat bread? they have not
      called upon God.<BR>
      6 They were afraid where no fear was; * for God hath broken the
      bones of him that besieged thee; thou hast put them to confusion,
      because God hath despised them.<BR>
      7 O that the salvation were given unto Israel out of Sion! *
      O that the Lord would deliver his people out of captivity!<BR>
      8 Then should Jacob rejoice, * and Israel should be right glad.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 54. Deus, in Nomine.</B><BR>
      SAVE me, O God, for thy Name's sake, * and avenge me in thy strength.<BR>
      2 Hear my prayer, O God, * and hearken unto the words of my mouth.<BR>
      3 For strangers are risen up against me; * and tyrants, which
      have not God before their eyes, seek after my soul.<BR>
      4 Behold, God is my helper; * the Lord is with them that uphold
      my soul.<BR>
      5 He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: * destroy thou them
      in thy truth.<BR>
      6 An offering of a free heart will I give thee, and praise thy
      Name, O LORD; * because it is so comfortable.<BR>
      7 For he hath delivered me out of all my trouble; * and mine
      eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 55. Exaudi, Deus.</B><BR>
      HEAR my prayer, O God, * and hide not thyself from my petition.<BR>
      2 Take heed unto me, and hear me, * how I mourn in my prayer,
      and am vexed;<BR>
      3 The enemy crieth so, and the ungodly cometh on so fast; * for
      they are minded to do me some mischief, so maliciously are they
      set against me.<BR>
      4 My heart is disquieted within me, * and the fear of death is
      fallen upon me.<BR>
      5 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, * and an horrible
      dread hath overwhelmed me.<BR>
      6 And I said, O that I had wings like a dove! * for then would
      I flee away, and be at rest.<BR>
      7 Lo, then would I get me away far off, * and remain in the wilderness.<BR>
      8 I would make haste to escape, * because of the stormy wind
      and tempest.<BR>
      9 Destroy their tongues, O Lord, and divide them; * for I have
      spied unrighteousness and strife in the city.<BR>
      10 Day and night they go about within the walls thereof: * mischief
      also and sorrow are in the midst of it.<BR>
      11 Wickedness is therein; * deceit and guile go not out of her
      streets.<BR>
      12 For it is not an open enemy that hath done me this dishonour;
      * for then I could have borne it;<BR>
      13 Neither was it mine adversary that did magnify himself against
      me; * for then peradventure I would have hid myself from him;<BR>
      14 But it was even thou, my companion, * my guide, and mine own
      familiar friend.<BR>
      15 We took sweet counsel together, * and walked in the house
      of God as friends.<BR>
      16 Let death come hastily upon them, and let them go down alive
      into the pit; * for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among
      them.<BR>
      17 As for me, I will call upon God, * and the LORD shall save
      me.<BR>
      18 In the evening, and morning, and at noon-day will I pray,
      and that instantly; * and he shall hear my voice.<BR>
      19 It is he that hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle
      that was against me; * for there were many that strove with me.<BR>
      20 Yea, even God, that endureth for ever, shall hear me, and
      bring them down; * for they will not turn, nor fear God.<BR>
      21 He laid his hands upon such as be at peace with him, * and
      he brake his covenant.<BR>
      22 The words of his mouth were softer than butter, having war
      in his heart; * his words were smoother than oil, and yet be
      they very swords.<BR>
      23 O cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall nourish thee,
      * and shall not suffer the righteous to fall for ever.<BR>
      24 And as for them, * thou, O God, shalt bring them into the
      pit of destruction.<BR>
      25 The blood-thirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half
      their days: * nevertheless, my trust shall be in thee, O Lord.</P>
