      <P><B>Psalm 147. Laudate Dominum.</B><BR>
      PRAISE the LORD, for it is a good thing to sing praises unto
      our God; * yea, a joyful and pleasant thing it is to be thankful.<BR>
      2 The LORD doth build up Jerusalem, * and gather together the
      outcasts of Israel.<BR>
      3 He healeth those that are broken in heart, * and giveth medicine
      to heal their sickness.<BR>
      4 He telleth the number of the stars, * and calleth them all
      by their names.<BR>
      5 Great is our Lord, and great is his power; * yea, and his wisdom
      is infinite.<BR>
      6 The LORD setteth up the meek, * and bringeth the ungodly down
      to the ground.<BR>
      7 O sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; * sing praises upon
      the harp unto our God:<BR>
      8 Who covereth the heaven with clouds, and prepareth rain for
      the earth; * and maketh the grass to grow upon the mountains,
      and herb for the use of men;<BR>
      9 Who giveth fodder unto the cattle, * and feedeth the young
      ravens that call upon him.<BR>
      10 He hath no pleasure in the strength of an horse; * neither
      delighteth he in any man's legs.<BR>
      11 But the LORD'S delight is in them that fear him, * and put
      their trust in his mercy. ~<BR>
      12 Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; * praise thy God, O Sion.<BR>
      13 For he hath made fast the bars of thy gates, * and hath blessed
      thy children within thee.<BR>
      14 He maketh peace in thy borders, * and filleth thee with the
      flour of wheat.<BR>
      15 He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth, * and his word
      runneth very swiftly.<BR>
      16 He giveth snow like wool, * and scattereth the hoarfrost like
      ashes.<BR>
      17 He casteth forth his ice like morsels: * who is able to abide
      his frost?<BR>
      18 He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: * he bloweth with
      his wind, and the waters flow.<BR>
      19 He showeth his word unto Jacob, * his statutes and ordinances
      unto Israel.<BR>
      20 He hath not dealt so with any nation; * neither have the heathen
      knowledge of his laws.
