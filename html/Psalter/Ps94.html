      <P><B>Psalm 94. Deus ultionum.</B><BR>
      O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth, * thou God, to whom
      vengeance belongeth, show thyself.<BR>
      2 Arise, thou Judge of the world, * and reward the proud after
      their deserving.<BR>
      3 LORD, how long shall the ungodly, * how long shall the ungodly
      triumph?<BR>
      4 How long shall all wicked doers speak so disdainfully, * and
      make such proud boasting?<BR>
      5 They smite down thy people, O LORD, * and trouble thine heritage.<BR>
      6 They murder the widow and the stranger, * and put the fatherless
      to death.<BR>
      7 And yet they say, Tush, the LORD shall not see, * neither shall
      the God of Jacob regard it.<BR>
      8 Take heed, ye unwise among the people: * O ye fools, when will
      ye understand?<BR>
      9 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? * or he that made
      the eye, shall he not see?<BR>
      10 Or he that instructeth the heathen, * it is he that teacheth
      man knowledge; shall not he punish?<BR>
      11 The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, * that they are but
      vain.<BR>
      12 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, * and teachest
      him in thy law;<BR>
      13 That thou mayest give him patience in time of adversity, *
      until the pit be digged up for the ungodly.<BR>
      14 For the LORD will not fail his people; * neither will he forsake
      his inheritance;<BR>
      15 Until righteousness turn again unto judgment: * all such as
      are true in heart shall follow it.<BR>
      16 Who will rise up with me against the wicked? * or who will
      take my part against the evil doers?<BR>
      17 If the LORD had not helped me, * it had not failed, but my
      soul had been put to silence.<BR>
      18 But when I said, My foot hath slipt; * thy mercy, O LORD,
      held me up.<BR>
      19 In the multitude of the sorrows that I had in my heart, *
      thy comforts have refreshed my soul.<BR>
      20 Wilt thou have any thing to do with the throne of wickedness,
      * which imagineth mischief as a law?<BR>
      21 They gather them together against the soul of the righteous,
      * and condemn the innocent blood.<BR>
      22 But the LORD is my refuge, * and my God is the strength of
      my confidence.<BR>
      23 He shall recompense them their wickedness, and destroy them
      in their own malice; * yea, the LORD our God shall destroy them.
