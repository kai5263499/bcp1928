    <p><strong><br />
      Psalm 1. Beatus vir qui non abiit.</strong><br />
      BLESSED is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, * and hath not sat in the seat of the scornful.<br />
      2 But his delight is in the law of the LORD; * and in his law will he exercise himself day and night.<br />
      3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the water-side, * that will bring forth his fruit in due season.<br />
      4 His leaf also shall not wither; * and look, whatsoever he doeth, it shall prosper.<br />
      5 As for the ungodly, it is not so with them; * but they are like the chaff, which the wind scattereth away from the face of the earth.<br />
      6 Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stand in the judgment, * neither the sinners in the congregation of the righteous.<br />
      7 But the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous; * and the way of the ungodly shall perish.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 2. Quare fremuerunt gentes?</strong><br />
      WHY do the heathen so furiously rage together? * and why do the people imagine a vain thing?<br />
      2 The kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take counsel together * against the LORD, and against his Anointed:<br />
      3 Let us break their bonds asunder, * and cast away their cords from us.<br />
      4 He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh them to scorn: * the Lord shall have them in derision.<br />
      5 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, * and vex them in his sore displeasure:<br />
      6 Yet have I set my King * upon my holy hill of Sion.<br />
      7 I will rehearse the decree; * the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.<br />
      8 Desire of me, and I shall give thee the nations for thine inheritance, * and the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession.<br />
      9 Thou shalt bruise them with a rod of iron, * and break them in pieces like a potter's vessel.<br />
      10 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings; * be instructed, ye that are judges of the earth.<br />
      11 Serve the LORD in fear, * and rejoice unto him with reverence.<br />
      12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and so ye perish from the right way, if his wrath be kindled, yea but a little. * Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 3. Domine, quid multiplicati?</strong><br />
      LORD, how are they increased that trouble me! * many are they that rise against me.<br />
      2 Many one there be that say of my soul, * There is no help for him in his God.<br />
      3 But thou, O LORD, art my defender; * thou art my worship, and the lifter up of my head.<br />
      4 I did call upon the LORD with my voice, * and he heard me out of his holy hill.<br />
      5 I laid me down and slept, and rose up again; * for the LORD sustained me.<br />
      6 I will not be afraid for ten thousands of the people, * that have set themselves against me round about.<br />
      7 UP, LORD, and help me, O my God, * for thou smitest all mine enemies upon the cheek-bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.<br />
      8 Salvation belongeth unto the LORD; * and thy blessing is upon thy people.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 4. Cum invocarem.</strong><br />
      HEAR me when I call, O God of my righteousness: * thou hast set me at liberty when I was in trouble; have mercy upon me, and hearken unto my prayer.<br />
      2 O ye sons of men, how long will ye blaspheme mine honour, * and have such pleasure in vanity, and seek after falsehood?<br />
      3 Know this also, that the LORD hath chosen to himself the man that is godly; * when I call upon the LORD he will hear me.<br />
      4 Stand in awe, and sin not; * commune with your own heart, and in your chamber, and be still.<br />
      5 Offer the sacrifice of righteousness, * and put your trust in the LORD.<br />
      6 There be many that say, * Who will show us any good?<br />
      7 LORD, lift thou up* the light of thy countenance upon us.<br />
      8 Thou hast put gladness in my heart; * yea, more than when their corn and wine and oil increase.<br />
      9 I will lay me down in peace, and take my rest; * for it is thou, LORD, only, that makest me dwell in safety.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 5. Verba mea auribus.</strong><br />
      PONDER my words, O LORD, * consider my meditation.<br />
      2 O hearken thou unto the voice of my calling, my King and my God: * for unto thee will I make my prayer.<br />
      3 My voice shalt thou hear betimes, O LORD; * early in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.<br />
      4 For thou art the God that hast no pleasure in wickedness; * neither shall any evil dwell with thee.<br />
      5 Such as be foolish shall not stand in thy sight; * for thou hatest all them that work iniquity.<br />
      6 Thou shalt destroy them that speak lies: * the LORD will abhor both the blood-thirsty and deceitful man.<br />
      7 But as for me, in the multitude of thy mercy I will come into thine house; * and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.<br />
      8 Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness, because of mine enemies; * make thy way plain before my face.<br />
      9 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; * their inward parts are very wickedness.<br />
      10 Their throat is an open sepulchre; * they flatter with their tongue.<br />
      11 Destroy thou them, O God; let them perish through their own imaginations; * cast them out in the multitude of their ungodliness; for they have rebelled against thee.<br />
      12 And let all them that put their trust in thee rejoice: * they shall ever be giving of thanks, because thou defendest them; they that love thy Name shall be joyful in thee;<br />
    13 For thou, LORD, wilt give thy blessing unto the righteous, * and with thy favourable kindness wilt thou defend him as with a shield.
