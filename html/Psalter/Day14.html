<BR>
      Morning Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 71. In te, Domine, speravi.</B><BR>
      IN thee, O LORD, have I put my trust; let me never be put to
      confusion, * but rid me and deliver me in thy righteousness;
      incline thine ear unto me, and save me.<BR>
      2 Be thou my stronghold, whereunto I may alway resort: * thou
      hast promised to help me, for thou art my house of defence, and
      my castle.<BR>
      3 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the ungodly, * out
      of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.<BR>
      4 For thou, O Lord GOD, art the thing that I long for: * thou
      art my hope, even from my youth.<BR>
      5 Through thee have I been holden up ever since I was born: *
      thou art he that took me out of my mother's womb: my praise shall
      be alway of thee.<BR>
      6 I am become as it were a monster unto many, * but my sure trust
      is in thee.<BR>
      7 O let my mouth be filled with thy praise, * that I may sing
      of thy glory and honour all the day long.<BR>
      8 Cast me not away in the time of age; * forsake me not when
      my strength faileth me.<BR>
      9 For mine enemies speak against me; * and they that lay wait
      for my soul take their counsel together, saying,<BR>
      10 God hath forsaken him; * persecute him, and take him, for
      there is none to deliver him.<BR>
      11 Go not far from me, O God; * my God, haste thee to help me.<BR>
      12 Let them be confounded and perish that are against my soul;
      * let them be covered with shame and dishonour that seek to do
      me evil.<BR>
      13 As for me, I will patiently abide alway, * and will praise
      thee more and more.<BR>
      14 My mouth shall daily speak of thy righteousness and salvation;
      * for I know no end thereof.<BR>
      15 I will go forth in the strength of the Lord GOD, * and will
      make mention of thy righteousness only.<BR>
      16 Thou, O God, hast taught me from my youth up until now; *
      therefore will I tell of thy wondrous works.<BR>
      17 Forsake me not, O God, in mine old age, when I am gray-headed,
      * until I have showed thy strength unto this generation, and
      thy power to all them that are yet for to come.<BR>
      18 Thy righteousness, O God, is very high, * and great things
      are they that thou hast done: O God, who is like unto thee!<BR>
      19 O what great troubles and adversities hast thou showed me
      ! and yet didst thou turn and refresh me; * yea, and broughtest
      me from the deep of the earth again.<BR>
      20 Thou hast brought me to great honour, * and comforted me on
      every side:<BR>
      21 Therefore will I praise thee, and thy faithfulness, O God,
      playing upon an instrument of music: * unto thee will I sing
      upon the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.<BR>
      22 My lips will be glad when I sing unto thee; * and so will
      my soul whom thou hast delivered.<BR>
      23 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day
      long; * for they are confounded and brought unto shame that seek
      to do me evil.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 72. Deus, judicium.</B><BR>
      GIVE the King thy judgments, O God, * and thy righteousness unto
      the King's son.<BR>
      2 Then shall he judge thy people according unto right, * and
      defend the poor.<BR>
      3 The mountains also shall bring peace, * and the little hills
      righteousness unto the people.<BR>
      4 He shall keep the simple folk by their right, * defend the
      children of the poor, and punish the wrong doer.<BR>
      5 They shall fear thee, as long as the sun and moon endureth,
      * from one generation to another.<BR>
      6 He shall come down like the rain upon the mown grass, * even
      as the drops that water the earth.<BR>
      7 In his time shall the righteous flourish; * yea, and abundance
      of peace, so long as the moon endureth.<BR>
      8 His dominion shall be also from the one sea to the other, *
      and from the River unto the world's end.<BR>
      9 They that dwell in the wilderness shall kneel before him; *
      his enemies shall lick the dust.<BR>
      10 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall give presents;
      * the kings of Arabia and Saba shall bring gifts.<BR>
      11 All kings shall fall down before him; * all nations shall
      do him service.<BR>
      12 For he shall deliver the poor when he crieth; * the needy
      also, and him that hath no helper.<BR>
      13 He shall be favourable to the simple and needy, * and shall
      preserve the souls of the poor.<BR>
      14 He shall deliver their souls from falsehood and wrong; * and
      dear shall their blood be in his sight.<BR>
      15 He shall live, and unto him shall be given of the gold of
      Arabia; * prayer shall be made ever unto him, and daily shall
      he be praised.<BR>
      16 There shall be an heap of corn in the earth, high upon the
      hills ; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: * and they
      of the city shall flourish like grass upon the earth.<BR>
      17 His Name shall endure for ever; his Name shall remain under
      the sun among the posterities, which shall be blessed in him;
      * and all the nations shall praise him.<BR>
      18 Blessed be the LORD God, even the God of Israel, * which only
      doeth wondrous things;<BR>
      19 And blessed be the Name of his majesty for ever: * and all
      the earth shall be filled with his majesty. Amen, Amen.<BR>

      <B><BR>
      Psalm 73. Quam bonus Israel!</B><BR>
      TRULY God is loving unto Israel: * even unto such as are of a
      clean heart.<BR>
      2 Nevertheless, my feet were almost gone, * my treadings had
      well-nigh slipt.<BR>
      3 And why? I was grieved at the wicked: * I do also see the ungodly
      in such prosperity.<BR>
      4 For they are in no peril of death; * but are lusty and strong.<BR>
      5 They come in no misfortune like other folk; * neither are they
      plagued like other men.<BR>
      6 And this is the cause that they are so holden with pride, *
      and cruelty covereth them as a garment.<BR>
      7 Their eyes swell with fatness, * and they do even what they
      lust.<BR>
      8 They corrupt other, and speak of wicked blasphemy; * their
      talking is against the Most High.<BR>
      9 For they stretch forth their mouth unto the heaven, * and their
      tongue goeth through the world.<BR>
      10 Therefore fall the people unto them, * and thereout suck they
      no small advantage.<BR>
      11 Tush, say they, how should God perceive it? * is there knowledge
      in the Most High?<BR>
      12 Lo, these are the ungodly, * these prosper in the world, and
      these have riches in possession:<BR>
      13 And I said, Then have I cleansed my heart in vain, * and washed
      my hands in innocency.<BR>
      14 All the day long have I been punished, * and chastened every
      morning.<BR>
      15 Yea, and I had almost said even as they; * but lo, then I
      should have condemned the generation of thy children.<BR>
      16 Then thought I to understand this; * but it was too hard for
      me,<BR>
      17 Until I went into the sanctuary of God: * then understood
      I the end of these men;<BR>
      18 Namely, how thou dost set them in slippery places, * and castest
      them down, and destroyest them.<BR>
      19 O how suddenly do they consume, * perish, and come to a fearful
      end!<BR>
      20 Yea, even like as a dream when one awaketh; * so shalt thou
      make their image to vanish out of the city.<BR>
      21 Thus my heart was grieved, * and it went even through my reins.<BR>
      22 So foolish was I, and ignorant, * even as it were a beast
      before thee.<BR>
      23 Nevertheless, I am alway by thee; * for thou hast holden me
      by my right hand.<BR>
      24 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, * and after that receive
      me with glory.<BR>
      25 Whom have I in heaven but thee? * and there is none upon earth
      that I desire in comparison of thee.<BR>
      26 My flesh and my heart faileth; * but God is the strength of
      my heart, and my portion for ever.<BR>
      27 For lo, they that forsake thee shall perish; * thou hast destroyed
      all them that are unfaithful unto thee.<BR>
      28 But it is good for me to hold me fast by God, to put my trust
      in the Lord GOD, * and to speak of all thy works in the gates
      of the daughter of Sion.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 74. Ut quid, Deus?</B><BR>
      O GOD, wherefore art thou absent from us so long? * why is thy
      wrath so hot against the sheep of thy pasture?<BR>
      2 O think upon thy congregation, * whom thou hast purchased,
      and redeemed of old.<BR>
      3 Think upon the tribe of thine inheritance, * and Mount Sion,
      wherein thou hast dwelt.<BR>
      4 Lift up thy feet, that thou mayest utterly destroy every enemy,
      * which hath done evil in thy sanctuary.<BR>
      5 Thine adversaries roar in the midst of thy congregations, *
      and set up their banners for tokens.<BR>
      6 He that hewed timber afore out of the thick trees, * was known
      to bring it to an excellent work.<BR>
      7 But now they break down all the carved work thereof * with
      axes and hammers.<BR>
      8 They have set fire upon thy holy places, * and have defiled
      the dwelling-place of thy Name, even unto the ground.<BR>
      9 Yea, they said in their hearts, Let us make havoc of them altogether:
      * thus have they burnt up all the houses of God in the land.<BR>
      10 We see not our tokens; there is not one prophet more; * no,
      not one is there among us, that understandeth any more.<BR>
      11 O God, how long shall the adversary do this dishonour? * shall
      the enemy blaspheme thy Name for ever?<BR>
      12 Why withdrawest thou thy hand? * why pluckest thou not thy
      right hand out of thy bosom to consume the enemy?<BR>
      13 For God is my King of old; * the help that is done upon earth,
      he doeth it himself.<BR>
      14 Thou didst divide the sea through thy power; * thou brakest
      the heads of the dragons in the waters.<BR>
      15 Thou smotest the heads of leviathan in pieces, * and gavest
      him to be meat for the people of the wilderness.<BR>
      16 Thou broughtest out fountains and waters out of the hard rocks;
      * thou driedst up mighty waters.<BR>
      17 The day is thine, and the night is thine; * thou hast prepared
      the light and the sun.<BR>
      18 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth; * thou hast made
      summer and winter.<BR>
      19 Remember this, O LORD, how the enemy hath rebuked; * and how
      the foolish people hath blasphemed thy Name.<BR>
      20 O deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the multitude
      of the enemies; * and forget not the congregation of the poor
      for ever.<BR>
      21 Look upon the covenant; * for all the earth is full of darkness
      and cruel habitations.<BR>
      22 O let not the simple go away ashamed; * but let the poor and
      needy give praise unto thy Name.<BR>
      23 Arise, O God, maintain thine own cause; * remember how the
      foolish man blasphemeth thee daily.<BR>
      24 Forget not the voice of thine enemies: * the presumption of
      them that hate thee increaseth ever more and more.</P>
