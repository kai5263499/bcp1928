      <P><B>Psalm 95. Venite, exultemus.</B><BR>
      O COME, let us sing unto the LORD; * let us heartily rejoice
      in the strength of our salvation.<BR>
      2 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving; * and show
      ourselves glad in him with psalms.<BR>
      3 For the LORD is a great God; * and a great King above all gods.<BR>
      4 In his hand are all the corners of the earth; * and the strength
      of the hills is his also.<BR>
      5 The sea is his, and he made it; * and his hands prepared the
      dry land.<BR>
      6 O come, let us worship and fall down, * and kneel before the
      LORD our Maker.<BR>
      7 For he is the Lord our God; * and we are the people of his
      pasture, and the sheep of his hand.<BR>
      8 To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts *
      as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the
      wilderness;<BR>
      9 When your fathers tempted me, * proved me, and saw my works.<BR>
      10 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said,
      * It is a people that do err in their hearts, for they have not
      known my ways:<BR>
      11 Unto whom I sware in my wrath, * that they should not enter
      into my rest.
