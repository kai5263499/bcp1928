    <p><strong>Psalm 119. I. Beati immaculati.</strong><br />
      BLESSED are those that are undefiled in the way, and walk in the law of the LORD.<br />
      2 Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, * and seek him with their whole heart;<br />
      3 Even they who do no wickedness, * and walk in his ways.<br />
      4 Thou hast charged * that we shall diligently keep thy commandments.<br />
      5 O that my ways were made so direct, * that I might keep thy statutes!<br />
      6 So shall I not be confounded, * while I have respect unto all thy commandments.<br />
      7 I will thank thee with an unfeigned heart, * when I shall have learned the judgments of thy righteousness.<br />
      8 I will keep thy statutes; * O forsake me not utterly.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>II. In quo corrigit?</strong><br />
      WHEREWITHAL shall a young man cleanse his way? * even by ruling himself after thy word.<br />
      10 With my whole heart have I sought thee; * O let me not go wrong out of thy commandments.<br />
      11 Thy word have I hid within my heart, * that I should not sin against thee.<br />
      12 Blessed art thou, O LORD; * O teach me thy statutes.<br />
      13 With my lips have I been telling * of all the judgments of thy mouth.<br />
      14 I have had as great delight in the way of thy testimonies, * as in all manner of riches.<br />
      15 I will talk of thy commandments, * and have respect unto thy ways.<br />
      16 My delight shall be in thy statutes, * and I will not forget thy word.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>III. Retribue servo tuo.</strong><br />
      O DO well unto thy servant; * that I may live, and keep thy word.<br />
      18 Open thou mine eyes; * that I may see the wondrous things of thy law.<br />
      19 I am a stranger upon earth; * O hide not thy commandments from me.<br />
      20 My soul breaketh out for the very fervent desire * that it hath alway unto thy judgments.<br />
      21 Thou hast rebuked the proud; * and cursed are they that do err from thy commandments.<br />
      22 O turn from me shame and rebuke; * for I have kept thy testimonies.<br />
      23 Princes also did sit and speak against me; * but thy servant is occupied in thy statutes.<br />
    24 For thy testimonies are my delight, * and my counsellors.</p>
    <p><strong>IV. Adhaesit pavimento.</strong><br />
      MY soul cleaveth to the dust; * O quicken thou me, according to thy word.<br />
      26 I have acknowledged my ways, and thou heardest me: * O teach me thy statutes.<br />
      27 Make me to understand the way of thy commandments; * and so shall I talk of thy wondrous works.<br />
      28 My soul melteth away for very heaviness; * comfort thou me according unto thy word.<br />
      29 Take from me the way of lying, * and cause thou me to make much of thy law.<br />
      30 I have chosen the way of truth, * and thy judgments have I laid before me.<br />
      31 I have stuck unto thy testimonies; * O LORD, confound me not.<br />
    32 I will run the way of thy commandments, * when thou hast set my heart at liberty.
