      <P><B>Psalm 68. Exsurgat Deus.</B><BR>
      LET God arise, and let his enemies be scattered; * let them also
      that hate him flee before him.<BR>
      2 Like as the smoke vanisheth, so shalt thou drive them away;
      * and like as wax melteth at the fire, so let the ungodly perish
      at the presence of God.<BR>
      3 But let the righteous be glad, and rejoice before God; * let
      them also be merry and joyful.<BR>
      4 O sing unto God, and sing praises unto his Name; magnify him
      that rideth upon the heavens; * praise him in his Name JAH, and
      rejoice before him.<BR>
      5 He is a Father of the fatherless, and defendeth the cause of
      the widows; * even God in his holy habitation.<BR>
      6 He is the God that maketh men to be of one mind in an house,
      and bringeth the prisoners out of captivity; * but letteth the
      runagates continue in scarceness.<BR>
      7 O God, when thou wentest forth before the people; * when thou
      wentest through the wilderness,<BR>
      8 The earth shook, and the heavens dropped at the presence of
      God; * even as Sinai also was moved at the presence of God, who
      is the God of Israel.<BR>
      9 Thou, O God, sentest a gracious rain upon thine inheritance,
      * and refreshedst it when it was weary.<BR>
      10 Thy congregation shall dwell therein; * for thou, O God, hast
      of thy goodness prepared for the poor.<BR>
      11 The Lord gave the word; * great was the company of women that
      bare the tidings.<BR>
      12 Kings with their armies did flee, and were discomfited, *
      and they of the household divided the spoil.<BR>
      13 Though ye have lain among the sheep-folds, yet shall ye be
      as the wings of a dove * that is covered with silver wings, and
      her feathers like gold.<BR>
      14 When the Almighty scattered kings for their sake, * then were
      they as white as snow in Salmon.<BR>
      15 As the hill of Bashan, so is God's hill; * even an high hill,
      as the hill of Bashan.<BR>
      16 Why mock ye so, ye high hills? this is God's hill, in the
      which it pleaseth him to dwell; * yea, the LORD will abide in
      it for ever.<BR>
      17 The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of
      angels; * and the Lord is among them as in the holy place of
      Sinai.<BR>
      18 Thou art gone up on high, thou hast led captivity captive,
      and received gifts from men; * yea, even from thine enemies,
      that the LORD God might dwell among them.<BR>
      19 Praised be the Lord daily, * even the God who helpeth us,
      and poureth his benefits upon us.<BR>
      20 He is our God, even the God of whom cometh salvation: * GOD
      is the Lord, by whom we escape death.<BR>
      21 God shall wound the head of his enemies, * and the hairy scalp
      of such a one as goeth on still in his wickedness.<BR>
      22 The Lord hath said, I will bring my people again, as I did
      from Bashan; * mine own will I bring again, as I did sometime
      from the deep of the sea.<BR>
      23 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies,
      * and that the tongue of thy dogs may be red through the same.<BR>
      24 It is well seen, O God, how thou goest; * how thou, my God
      and King, goest in the sanctuary.<BR>
      25 The singers go before, the minstrels follow after, * in the
      midst of the damsels playing with the timbrels.<BR>
      26 Give thanks unto God the Lord in the congregation, * ye that
      are of the fountain of Israel.<BR>
      27 There is little Benjamin their ruler, and the princes of Judah
      their council; * the princes of Zebulon, and the princes of Naphthali.<BR>
      28 Thy God hath sent forth strength for thee; * stablish the
      thing, O God, that thou hast wrought in us,<BR>
      29 For thy temple's sake at Jerusalem; * so shall kings bring
      presents unto thee.<BR>
      30 Rebuke thou the dragon and the bull, with the leaders of the
      heathen, so that they humbly bring pieces of silver; * scatter
      thou the peoples that delight in war;<BR>
      31 Then shall the princes come out of Egypt; * the Morians' land
      shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.<BR>
      32 Sing unto God, O ye kingdoms of the earth; * O sing praises
      unto the Lord;<BR>
      33 Who sitteth in the heavens over all, from the beginning: *
      lo, he doth send out his voice; yea, and that a mighty voice.<BR>
      34 Ascribe ye the power to God over Israel; * his worship and
      strength is in the clouds.<BR>
      35 O God, wonderful art thou in thy holy places: * even the God
      of Israel, he will give strength and power unto his people. Blessed
      be God.
