      The Fourth Day.<BR>
<BR>
      Morning Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 19. Caeli enarrant.</B><BR>
      THE heavens declare the glory of God; * and the firmament showeth
      his handy-work.<BR>
      2 One day telleth another; * and one night certifieth another.<BR>
      3 There is neither speech nor language; * but their voices are
      heard among them.<BR>
      4 Their sound is gone out into all lands; * and their words into
      the ends of the world.<BR>
      5 In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun; * which cometh
      forth as a bridegroom out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a
      giant to run his course.<BR>
      6 It goeth forth from the uttermost part of the heaven, and runneth
      about unto the end of it again; * and there is nothing hid from
      the heat thereof.<BR>
      7 The law of the LORD is an undefiled law, converting the soul;
      * the testimony of the LORD is sure, and giveth wisdom unto the
      simple.<BR>
      8 The statutes of the LORD are right, and rejoice the heart;
      * the commandment of the LORD is pure, and giveth light unto
      the eyes.<BR>
      9 The fear of the LORD is clean, and endureth for ever; * the
      judgments of the LORD are true, and righteous altogether.<BR>
      10 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine
      gold; * sweeter also than honey, and the honeycomb.<BR>
      11 Moreover, by them is thy servant taught; * and in keeping
      of them there is great reward.<BR>
      12 Who can tell how oft he offendeth? * O cleanse thou me from
      my secret faults.<BR>
      13 Keep thy servant also from presumptuous sins, lest they get
      the dominion over me; * so shall I be undefiled, and innocent
      from the great offence.<BR>
      14 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart,
      be alway acceptable in thy sight, * O LORD, my strength and my
      redeemer.<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 20. Exaudiat te Dominus.</B><BR>
      THE LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; * the Name of the God
      of Jacob defend thee:<BR>
      2 Send thee help from the sanctuary, * and strengthen thee out
      of Sion:<BR>
      3 Remember all thy offerings, * and accept thy burnt-sacrifice:<BR>
      4 Grant thee thy heart's desire, * and fulfil all thy mind.<BR>
      5 We will rejoice in thy salvation, and triumph in the Name of
      the Lord our God: * the LORD perform all thy petitions.<BR>
      6 Now know I that the LORD helpeth his anointed, and will hear
      him from his holy heaven, * even with the wholesome strength
      of his right hand.<BR>
      7 Some put their trust in chariots, and some in horses; * but
      we will remember the Name of the LORD our God.<BR>
      8 They are brought down and fallen; * but we are risen and stand
      upright.<BR>
      9 Save, LORD; and hear us, O King of heaven, * when we call upon
      thee.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 21. Domine, in virtute tua.</B><BR>
      THE King shall rejoice in thy strength, O LORD; * exceeding glad
      shall he be of thy salvation.<BR>
      2 Thou hast given him his heart's desire, * and hast not denied
      him the request of his lips.<BR>
      3 For thou shalt meet him with the blessings of goodness, * and
      shalt set a crown of pure gold upon his head.<BR>
      4 He asked life of thee; and thou gavest him a long life, * even
      for ever and ever.<BR>
      5 His honour is great in thy salvation; * glory and great worship
      shalt thou lay upon him.<BR>
      6 For thou shalt give him everlasting felicity, * and make him
      glad with the joy of thy countenance.<BR>
      7 And why? because the King putteth his trust in the LORD; *
      and in the mercy of the Most Highest he shall not miscarry.<BR>
      8 All thine enemies shall feel thine hand; * thy right hand shall
      find out them that hate thee.<BR>
      9 Thou shalt make them like a fiery oven in time of thy wrath:
      * the LORD shall destroy them in his displeasure, and the fire
      shall consume them.<BR>
      10 Their fruit shalt thou root out of the earth, * and their
      seed from among the children of men.<BR>
      11 For they intended mischief against thee, * and imagined such
      a device as they are not able to perform.<BR>
      12 Therefore shalt thou put them to flight, * and the strings
      of thy bow shalt thou make ready against the face of them.<BR>
      13 Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength; * so will we
      sing, and praise thy power.<BR>

      <P><CENTER><A NAME="anchor485948"></A>Evening Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 22. Deus, Deus meus.</B><BR>
      MY God, my God, look upon me; why hast thou forsaken me? * and
      art so far from my health, and from the words of my complaint?<BR>
      2 O my God, I cry in the day-time, but thou hearest not; * and
      in the night season also I take no rest.<BR>
      3 And thou continuest holy, * O thou Worship of Israel.<BR>
      4 Our fathers hoped in thee; * they trusted in thee, and thou
      didst deliver them.<BR>
      5 They called upon thee, and were holpen; * they put their trust
      in thee, and were not confounded.<BR>
      6 But as for me, I am a worm, and no man; * a very scorn of men,
      and the outcast of the people.<BR>
      7 All they that see me laugh me to scorn; * they shoot out their
      lips, and shake their heads, saying,<BR>
      8 He trusted in the LORD, that he would deliver him; * let him
      deliver him, if he will have him.<BR>
      9 But thou art he that took me out of my mother's womb; * thou
      wast my hope, when I hanged yet upon my mother's breasts.<BR>
      10 I have been left unto thee ever since I was born; * thou art
      my God even from my mother's womb.<BR>
      11 O go not from me; for trouble is hard at hand, * and there
      is none to help me.<BR>
      12 Many oxen are come about me; * fat bulls of Bashan close me
      in on every side.<BR>
      13 They gape upon me with their mouths, * as it were a ramping
      and a roaring lion.<BR>
      14 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint;
      * my heart also in the midst of my body is even like melting
      wax.<BR>
      15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my<BR>
      tongue cleaveth to my gums, * and thou bringest me into the dust
      of death.<BR>
      16 For many dogs are come about me, * and the council of the
      wicked layeth siege against me.<BR>
      17 They pierced my hands and my feet: I may tell all my bones:
      * they stand staring and looking upon me.<BR>
      18 They part my garments among them, * and cast lots upon my
      vesture.<BR>
      19 But be not thou far from me, O LORD; * thou art my succour,
      haste thee to help me.<BR>
      20 Deliver my soul from the sword, * my darling from the power
      of the dog.<BR>
      21 Save me from the lion's mouth; * thou hast heard me also from
      among the horns of the unicorns.<BR>
      22 I will declare thy Name unto my brethren; * in the midst of
      the congregation will I praise thee.<BR>
      23 O praise the LORD, ye that fear him: * magnify him, all ye
      of the seed of Jacob; and fear him, all ye seed of Israel.<BR>
      24 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the low estate of the
      poor; * he hath not hid his face from him; but when he called
      unto him he heard him.<BR>
      25 My praise is of thee in the great-congregation; * my vows
      will I perform in the sight of them that fear him.<BR>
      26 The poor shall eat, and be satisfied; they that seek after
      the LORD shall praise him: * your heart shall live for ever.<BR>
      27 All the ends of the world shall remember themselves, and be
      turned unto the LORD; * and all the kindreds of the nations shall
      worship before him.<BR>
      28 For the kingdom is the LORD'S, * and he is the Governor among
      the nations.<BR>
      29 All such as be fat upon earth * have eaten, and worshipped.<BR>
      30 All they that go down into the dust shall kneel before him;
      * and no man hath quickened his own soul.<BR>
      31 My seed shall serve him: * they shall be counted unto the
      Lord for a generation.<BR>
      32 They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness * unto
      a people that shall be born, whom the Lord hath made.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 23. Dominus regit me.</B><BR>
      THE LORD is my shepherd; * therefore can I lack nothing.<BR>
      2 He shall feed me in a green pasture, * and lead me forth beside
      the waters of comfort.<BR>
      3 He shall convert my soul, * and bring me forth in the paths
      of righteousness for his Name's sake.<BR>
      4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
      I will fear no evil; * for thou art with me; thy rod and thy
      staff comfort me.<BR>
      5 Thou shalt prepare a table before me in the presence of them
      that trouble me; * thou hast anointed my head with oil, and my
      cup shall be full.<BR>
      6 Surely thy loving-kindness and mercy shall follow me all the
      days of my life; * and I will dwell in the house of the LORD
      for ever.</P>
