    <p><strong>Psalm 86. Inclina, Domine.</strong><br />
      BOW down thine ear, O LORD, and hear me; * for I am poor, and in misery.<br />
      2 Preserve thou my soul, for I am holy: * my God, save thy servant that putteth his trust in thee.<br />
      3 Be merciful unto me, O Lord; * for I will call daily upon thee.<br />
      4 Comfort the soul of thy servant; * for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.<br />
      5 For thou, Lord, art good and gracious, * and of great mercy unto all them that call upon thee.<br />
      6 Give ear, LORD, unto my prayer, * and ponder the voice of my humble desires.<br />
      7 In the time of my trouble I will call upon thee; * for thou hearest me.<br />
      8 Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; * there is not one that can do as thou doest.<br />
      9 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship thee, O Lord; * and shall glorify thy Name.<br />
      10 For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: * thou art God alone.<br />
      11 Teach me thy way, O LORD, and I will walk in thy truth: * O knit my heart unto thee, that I may fear thy Name.<br />
      12 I will thank thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart; * and will praise thy Name for evermore.<br />
      13 For great is thy mercy toward me; * and thou hast delivered my soul from the nethermost hell.<br />
      14 O God, the proud are risen against me; * and the congregations of violent men have sought after my soul, and have not set thee before their eyes.<br />
      15 But thou, O Lord God, art full of compassion and mercy, * long-suffering, plenteous in goodness and truth.<br />
      16 O turn thee then unto me, and have mercy upon me; * give thy strength unto thy servant, and help the son of thine handmaid.<br />
      17 Show some token upon me for good; that they who hate me may see it, and be ashamed, * because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 87. Fundamenta ejus.</strong><br />
      HER foundations are upon the holy hills: * the LORD loveth the gates of Sion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.<br />
      2 Very excellent things are spoken of thee, * thou city of God.<br />
      3 I will make mention of Egypt and Babylon, * among them that know me.<br />
      4 Behold, Philistia also; and Tyre, with Ethiopia; * lo, in Sion were they born.<br />
      5 Yea, of Sion it shall be reported, this one and that one were born in her; * and the Most High shall stablish her.<br />
      6 The LORD shall record it, when he writeth up the peoples; * lo, in Sion were they born.<br />
      7 The singers also and trumpeters shall make answer: * All my fresh springs are in thee.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 88. Domine, Deus.</strong><br />
      O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee: * O let my prayer enter into thy presence, incline thine ear unto my calling;<br />
      2 For my soul is full of trouble, * and my life draweth nigh unto the grave.<br />
      3 I am counted as one of them that go down into the pit, * and I am even as a man that hath no strength;<br />
      4 Cast off among the dead, like unto them that are slain, and lie in the grave, * who are out of remembrance, and are cut away from thy hand.<br />
      5 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, * in a place of darkness, and in the deep.<br />
      6 Thine indignation lieth hard upon me, * and thou hast vexed me with all thy storms.<br />
      7 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me, * and made me to be abhorred of them.<br />
      8 I am so fast in prison * that I cannot get forth.<br />
      9 My sight faileth for very trouble; * LORD, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched forth my hands unto thee.<br />
      10 Dost thou show wonders among the dead? * or shall the dead rise up again, and praise thee?<br />
      11 Shall thy loving-kindness be showed in the grave? * or thy faithfulness in destruction?<br />
      12 Shall thy wondrous works be known in the dark? * and thy righteousness in the land where all things are forgotten?<br />
      13 Unto thee have I cried, O LORD; * and early shall my prayer come before thee.<br />
      14 LORD, why abhorrest thou my soul, * and hidest thou thy face from me?<br />
      15 I am in misery, and like unto him that is at the point to die; * even from my youth up, thy terrors have I suffered with a troubled mind.<br />
      16 Thy wrathful displeasure goeth over me, * and the fear of thee hath undone me.<br />
      17 They came round about me daily like water, * and compassed me together on every side.<br />
    18 My lovers and friends hast thou put away from me, * and hid mine acquaintance out of my sight.
