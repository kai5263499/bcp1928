      <P><B>Psalm 71. In te, Domine, speravi.</B><BR>
      IN thee, O LORD, have I put my trust; let me never be put to
      confusion, * but rid me and deliver me in thy righteousness;
      incline thine ear unto me, and save me.<BR>
      2 Be thou my stronghold, whereunto I may alway resort: * thou
      hast promised to help me, for thou art my house of defence, and
      my castle.<BR>
      3 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the ungodly, * out
      of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.<BR>
      4 For thou, O Lord GOD, art the thing that I long for: * thou
      art my hope, even from my youth.<BR>
      5 Through thee have I been holden up ever since I was born: *
      thou art he that took me out of my mother's womb: my praise shall
      be alway of thee.<BR>
      6 I am become as it were a monster unto many, * but my sure trust
      is in thee.<BR>
      7 O let my mouth be filled with thy praise, * that I may sing
      of thy glory and honour all the day long.<BR>
      8 Cast me not away in the time of age; * forsake me not when
      my strength faileth me.<BR>
      9 For mine enemies speak against me; * and they that lay wait
      for my soul take their counsel together, saying,<BR>
      10 God hath forsaken him; * persecute him, and take him, for
      there is none to deliver him.<BR>
      11 Go not far from me, O God; * my God, haste thee to help me.<BR>
      12 Let them be confounded and perish that are against my soul;
      * let them be covered with shame and dishonour that seek to do
      me evil.<BR>
      13 As for me, I will patiently abide alway, * and will praise
      thee more and more.<BR>
      14 My mouth shall daily speak of thy righteousness and salvation;
      * for I know no end thereof.<BR>
      15 I will go forth in the strength of the Lord GOD, * and will
      make mention of thy righteousness only.<BR>
      16 Thou, O God, hast taught me from my youth up until now; *
      therefore will I tell of thy wondrous works.<BR>
      17 Forsake me not, O God, in mine old age, when I am gray-headed,
      * until I have showed thy strength unto this generation, and
      thy power to all them that are yet for to come.<BR>
      18 Thy righteousness, O God, is very high, * and great things
      are they that thou hast done: O God, who is like unto thee!<BR>
      19 O what great troubles and adversities hast thou showed me
      ! and yet didst thou turn and refresh me; * yea, and broughtest
      me from the deep of the earth again.<BR>
      20 Thou hast brought me to great honour, * and comforted me on
      every side:<BR>
      21 Therefore will I praise thee, and thy faithfulness, O God,
      playing upon an instrument of music: * unto thee will I sing
      upon the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.<BR>
      22 My lips will be glad when I sing unto thee; * and so will
      my soul whom thou hast delivered.<BR>
      23 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day
      long; * for they are confounded and brought unto shame that seek
      to do me evil.
