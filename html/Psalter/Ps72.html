      <P><B>Psalm 72. Deus, judicium.</B><BR>
      GIVE the King thy judgments, O God, * and thy righteousness unto
      the King's son.<BR>
      2 Then shall he judge thy people according unto right, * and
      defend the poor.<BR>
      3 The mountains also shall bring peace, * and the little hills
      righteousness unto the people.<BR>
      4 He shall keep the simple folk by their right, * defend the
      children of the poor, and punish the wrong doer.<BR>
      5 They shall fear thee, as long as the sun and moon endureth,
      * from one generation to another.<BR>
      6 He shall come down like the rain upon the mown grass, * even
      as the drops that water the earth.<BR>
      7 In his time shall the righteous flourish; * yea, and abundance
      of peace, so long as the moon endureth.<BR>
      8 His dominion shall be also from the one sea to the other, *
      and from the River unto the world's end.<BR>
      9 They that dwell in the wilderness shall kneel before him; *
      his enemies shall lick the dust.<BR>
      10 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall give presents;
      * the kings of Arabia and Saba shall bring gifts.<BR>
      11 All kings shall fall down before him; * all nations shall
      do him service.<BR>
      12 For he shall deliver the poor when he crieth; * the needy
      also, and him that hath no helper.<BR>
      13 He shall be favourable to the simple and needy, * and shall
      preserve the souls of the poor.<BR>
      14 He shall deliver their souls from falsehood and wrong; * and
      dear shall their blood be in his sight.<BR>
      15 He shall live, and unto him shall be given of the gold of
      Arabia; * prayer shall be made ever unto him, and daily shall
      he be praised.<BR>
      16 There shall be an heap of corn in the earth, high upon the
      hills ; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: * and they
      of the city shall flourish like grass upon the earth.<BR>
      17 His Name shall endure for ever; his Name shall remain under
      the sun among the posterities, which shall be blessed in him;
      * and all the nations shall praise him.<BR>
      18 Blessed be the LORD God, even the God of Israel, * which only
      doeth wondrous things;<BR>
      19 And blessed be the Name of his majesty for ever: * and all
      the earth shall be filled with his majesty. Amen, Amen.
