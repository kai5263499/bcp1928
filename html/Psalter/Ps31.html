      <P><B>Psalms 31. In te, Domine, speravi.</B><BR>
      IN thee, O LORD, have I put my trust; let me never be put to
      confusion; * deliver me in thy righteousness.<BR>
      2 Bow down thine ear to me; * make haste to deliver me.<BR>
      3 And be thou my strong rock, and house of defence, * that thou
      mayest save me.<BR>
      4 For thou art my strong rock, and my castle: * be thou also
      my guide, and lead me for thy Name's sake.<BR>
      5 Draw me out of the net that they have laid privily for me;
      * for thou art my strength.<BR>
      6 Into thy hands I commend my spirit; * for thou hast redeemed
      me, O LORD, thou God of truth.<BR>
      7 I have hated them that hold of lying vanities, * and my trust
      hath been in the LORD.<BR>
      8 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy; * for thou hast considered
      my trouble, and hast known my soul in adversities.<BR>
      9 Thou hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy; * but
      hast set my feet in a large room.<BR>
      10 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble, * and mine
      eye is consumed for very heaviness; yea, my soul and my body.<BR>
      11 For my life is waxen old with heaviness, * and my years with
      mourning.<BR>
      12 My strength faileth me, because of mine iniquity, * and my
      bones are consumed.<BR>
      13 I became a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially
      among my neighbours; * and they of mine acquaintance were afraid
      of me; and they that did see me without, conveyed themselves
      from me.<BR>
      14 I am clean forgotten as a dead man out of mind; * I am become
      like a broken vessel.<BR>
      15 For I have heard the blasphemy of the multitude, and fear
      is on every side; * while they conspire together against me,
      and take their counsel to take away my life.<BR>
      16 But my hope hath been in thee, O LORD; * I have said, Thou
      art my God.<BR>
      17 My times are in thy hand; deliver me from the hand of mine
      enemies, * and from them that persecute me.<BR>
      18 Show thy servant the light of thy countenance, * and save
      me for thy mercy's sake.<BR>
      19 Let me not be confounded, O LORD, for I have called upon thee;
      * let the ungodly be put to confusion, and be put to silence
      in the grave.<BR>
      20 Let the lying lips be put to silence, * which cruelly, disdainfully,
      and despitefully speak against the righteous.<BR>
      21 O how plentiful is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for
      them that fear thee, * and that thou hast prepared for them that
      put their trust in thee, even before the sons of men!<BR>
      22 Thou shalt hide them in the covert of thine own presence from
      the plottings of men: * thou shalt keep them secretly in thy
      tabernacle from the strife of tongues.<BR>
      23 Thanks be to the LORD; * for he hath showed me marvellous
      great kindness in a strong city.<BR>
      24 But in my haste I said, * I am cast out of the sight of thine
      eyes.<BR>
      25 Nevertheless, thou heardest the voice of my prayer, * when
      I cried unto thee.<BR>
      26 O love the LORD, all ye his saints; * for the LORD preserveth
      them that are faithful, and plenteously rewardeth the proud doer.<BR>
      27 Be strong, and he shall establish your heart, * all ye that
      put your trust in the LORD.
