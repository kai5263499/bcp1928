      <P><B>Psalm 141. Domine, clamavi.</B><BR>
      LORD, I call upon thee; haste thee unto me, * and consider my
      voice, when I cry unto thee.<BR>
      2 Let my prayer be set forth in thy sight as the incense; * and
      let the lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice.<BR>
      3 Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth, * and keep the door of
      my lips.<BR>
      4 O let not mine heart be inclined to any evil thing; * let me
      not be occupied in ungodly works with the men that work wickedness,
      neither let me eat of such things as please them.<BR>
      5 Let the righteous rather smite me friendly, and reprove me;
      * yea, let not my head refuse their precious balms.<BR>
      6 As for the ungodly, * I will pray yet against their wickedness.<BR>
      7 Let their judges be overthrown in stony places, * that they
      may hear my words; for they are sweet.<BR>
      8 Our bones lie scattered before the pit, * like as when one
      breaketh and heweth wood upon the earth.<BR>
      9 But mine eyes look unto thee, O LORD God; * in thee is my trust;
      O cast not out my soul.<BR>
      10 Keep me from the snare that they have laid for me, * and from
      the traps of the wicked doers.<BR>
      11 Let the ungodly fall into their own nets together, * and let
      me ever escape them.
