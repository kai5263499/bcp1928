      <P><B>Psalms 35. Judica, Domine.</B><BR>
      PLEAD thou my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me, *
      and fight thou against them that fight against me.<BR>
      2 Lay hand upon the shield and buckler, * and stand up to help
      me.<BR>
      3 Bring forth the spear, and stop the way against them that pursue
      me: * say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.<BR>
      4 Let them be confounded, and put to shame, that seek after my
      soul; * let them be turned back, and brought to confusion, that
      imagine mischief for me.<BR>
      5 Let them be as the dust before the wind, * and the angel of
      the LORD scattering them.<BR>
      6 Let their way be dark and slippery, * and let the angel of
      the LORD pursue them.<BR>
      7 For they have privily laid their net to destroy me without
      a cause; * yea, even without a cause have they made a pit for
      my soul.<BR>
      8 Let a sudden destruction come upon him unawares, and his net
      that he hath laid privily catch himself; * that he may fall into
      his own mischief.<BR>
      9 And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD; * it shall rejoice
      in his salvation.<BR>
      10 All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, who deliverest
      the poor from him that is too strong for him; * yea, the poor,
      and him that is in misery, from him that spoileth him?<BR>
      11 False witnesses did rise up: * they laid to my charge things
      that I knew not.<BR>
      12 They rewarded me evil for good, * to the great discomfort
      of my soul.<BR>
      13 Nevertheless, when they were sick, I put on sackcloth, and
      humbled my soul with fasting; * and my prayer shall turn into
      mine own bosom.<BR>
      14 I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother;
      * I went heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.<BR>
      15 But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves
      together; * yea, the very abjects came together against me unawares,
      making mouths at me, and ceased not.<BR>
      16 With the flatterers were busy mockers, * who gnashed upon
      me with their teeth.<BR>
      17 Lord, how long wilt thou look upon this? * O deliver my soul
      from the calamities which they bring on me, and my darling from
      the lions.<BR>
      18 So will I give thee thanks in the great congregation; * I
      will praise thee among much people.<BR>
      19 O let not them that are mine enemies triumph over me ungodly;
      * neither let them wink with their eyes, that hate me without
      a cause.<BR>
      20 And why? their communing is not for peace; * but they imagine
      deceitful words against them that are quiet in the land.<BR>
      21 They gaped upon me with their mouths, and said, * Fie on thee!
      fie on thee! we saw it with our eyes.<BR>
      22 This thou hast seen, O LORD; * hold not thy tongue then; go
      not far from me, O Lord.<BR>
      23 Awake, and stand up to judge my quarrel; * avenge thou my
      cause, my God and my Lord.<BR>
      24 Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; *
      and let them not triumph over me.<BR>
      25 Let them not say in their hearts, There! there! so would we
      have it; * neither let them say, We have devoured him.<BR>
      26 Let them be put to confusion and shame together, that rejoice
      at my trouble; * let them be clothed with rebuke and dishonour,
      that boast themselves against me.<BR>
      27 Let them be glad and rejoice, that favour my righteous dealing;
      * yea, let them say alway, Blessed be the LORD, who hath pleasure
      in the prosperity of his servant.<BR>
      28 And as for my tongue, it shall be talking of thy righteousness,
      * and of thy praise, all the day long.
