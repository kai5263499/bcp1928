      <P><CENTER>The Twenty-ninth Day.<BR>
<BR>
      Morning Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 139. Domine, probasti.</B><BR>
      O LORD, thou hast searched me out, and known me. * Thou knowest
      my down-sitting, and mine uprising; thou understandest my thoughts
      long before.<BR>
      2 Thou art about my path, and about my bed; * and art acquainted
      with all my ways.<BR>
      3 For lo, there is not a word in my tongue, * but thou, O LORD,
      knowest it altogether.<BR>
      4 Thou hast beset me behind and before, * and laid thine hand
      upon me.<BR>
      5 Such knowledge is too wonderful and excellent for me; * I cannot
      attain unto it.<BR>
      6 Whither shall I go then from thy Spirit? * or whither shall
      I go then from thy presence?<BR>
      7 If I climb up into heaven, thou art there; * if I go down to
      hell, thou art there also.<BR>
      8 If I take the wings of the morning, * and remain in the uttermost
      parts of the sea;<BR>
      9 Even there also shall thy hand lead me, * and thy right hand
      shall hold me.<BR>
      10 If I say, Peradventure the darkness shall cover me; * then
      shall my night be turned to day.<BR>
      11 Yea, the darkness is no darkness with thee, but the night
      is as clear as the day; * the darkness and light to thee are
      both alike.<BR>
      12 For my reins are thine; * thou hast covered me in my mother's
      womb.<BR>
      13 I will give thanks unto thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully
      made: * marvellous are thy works, and that my soul knoweth right
      well.<BR>
      14 My bones are not hid from thee, * though I be made secretly,
      and fashioned beneath in the earth.<BR>
      15 Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being imperfect; * and
      in thy book were all my members written;<BR>
      16 Which day by day were fashioned, * when as yet there was none
      of them.<BR>
      17 How dear are thy counsels unto me, O God; * O how great is
      the sum of them!<BR>
      18 If I tell them, they are more in number than the sand: * when
      I wake up, I am present with thee.<BR>
      19 Wilt thou not slay the wicked, O God? * Depart from me, ye
      blood-thirsty men.<BR>
      20 For they speak unrighteously against thee; * and thine enemies
      take thy Name in vain.<BR>
      21 Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? * and am not I
      grieved with those that rise up against thee?<BR>
      22 Yea, I hate them right sore; * even as though they were mine
      enemies.<BR>
      23 Try me, O God, and seek the ground of my heart; * prove me,
      and examine my thoughts.<BR>
      24 Look well if there be any way of wickedness in me; * and lead
      me in the way everlasting.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 140. Eripe me, Domine.</B><BR>
      DELIVER me, O LORD, from the evil man; * and preserve me from
      the wicked man;<BR>
      2 Who imagine mischief in their hearts, * and stir up strife
      all the day long.<BR>
      3 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; * adder's
      poison is under their lips.<BR>
      4 Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the ungodly; * preserve
      me from the wicked men, who are purposed to overthrow my goings.<BR>
      5 The proud have laid a snare for me, and spread a net abroad
      with cords; * yea, and set traps in my way.<BR>
      6 I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God, * hear the voice of
      my prayers, O LORD.<BR>
      7 O LORD God, thou strength of my health; * thou hast covered
      my head in the day of battle.<BR>
      8 Let not the ungodly have his desire, O LORD; * let not his
      mischievous imagination prosper, lest they be too proud.<BR>
      9 Let the mischief of their own lips fall upon the head of them
      * that compass me about.<BR>
      10 Let hot burning coals fall upon them; * let them be cast into
      the fire, and into the pit, that they never rise up again.<BR>
      11 A man full of words shall not prosper upon the earth: * evil
      shall hunt the wicked person to overthrow him.<BR>
      12 Sure I am that the LORD will avenge the poor, * and maintain
      the cause of the helpless.<BR>
      13 The righteous also shall give thanks unto thy Name; * and
      the just shall continue in thy sight.<BR>

      <P><CENTER><A NAME="anchor482282"></A><B>Evening Prayer.</B></CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 141. Domine, clamavi.</B><BR>
      LORD, I call upon thee; haste thee unto me, * and consider my
      voice, when I cry unto thee.<BR>
      2 Let my prayer be set forth in thy sight as the incense; * and
      let the lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice.<BR>
      3 Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth, * and keep the door of
      my lips.<BR>
      4 O let not mine heart be inclined to any evil thing; * let me
      not be occupied in ungodly works with the men that work wickedness,
      neither let me eat of such things as please them.<BR>
      5 Let the righteous rather smite me friendly, and reprove me;
      * yea, let not my head refuse their precious balms.<BR>
      6 As for the ungodly, * I will pray yet against their wickedness.<BR>
      7 Let their judges be overthrown in stony places, * that they
      may hear my words; for they are sweet.<BR>
      8 Our bones lie scattered before the pit, * like as when one
      breaketh and heweth wood upon the earth.<BR>
      9 But mine eyes look unto thee, O LORD God; * in thee is my trust;
      O cast not out my soul.<BR>
      10 Keep me from the snare that they have laid for me, * and from
      the traps of the wicked doers.<BR>
      11 Let the ungodly fall into their own nets together, * and let
      me ever escape them.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 142. Voce mea ad Dominum.</B><BR>
      I CRIED unto the LORD with my voice; * yea, even unto the LORD
      did I make my supplication.<BR>
      2 I poured out my complaints before him, * and showed him of
      my trouble.<BR>
      3 When my spirit was in heaviness, thou knewest my path; * in
      the way wherein I walked, have they privily laid a snare for
      me.<BR>
      4 I looked also upon my right hand, * and saw there was no man
      that would know me.<BR>
      5 I had no place to flee unto, * and no man cared for my soul.<BR>
      6 I cried unto thee, O LORD, and said, * Thou art my hope, and
      my portion in the land of the living.<BR>
      7 Consider my complaint; * for I am brought very low.<BR>
      8 O deliver me from my persecutors; * for they are too strong
      for me.<BR>
      9 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks unto thy
      Name; * which thing if thou wilt grant me, then shall the righteous
      resort unto my company.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 143. Domine, exaudi.</B><BR>
      HEAR my prayer, O LORD, and consider my desire; * hearken unto
      me for thy truth and righteousness' sake.<BR>
      2 And enter not into judgment with thy servant; * for in thy
      sight shall no man living be justified.<BR>
      3 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life
      down to the ground; * he hath laid me in the darkness, as the
      men that have been long dead.<BR>
      4 Therefore is my spirit vexed within me, * and my heart within
      me is desolate.<BR>
      5 Yet do I remember the time past; I muse upon all thy works;
      * yea, I exercise myself in the works of thy hands.<BR>
      6 I stretch forth my hands unto thee; * my soul gaspeth unto
      thee as a thirsty land.<BR>
      7 Hear me, O LORD, and that soon; for my spirit waxeth faint:
      * hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go
      down into the pit.<BR>
      8 O let me hear thy loving-kindness betimes in the morning; for
      in thee is my trust: * show thou me the way that I should walk
      in; for I lift up my soul unto thee.<BR>
      9 Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies; * for I flee unto thee
      to hide me.<BR>
      10 Teach me to do the thing that pleaseth thee; for thou art
      my God: * let thy loving Spirit lead me forth into the land of
      righteousness.<BR>
      11 Quicken me, O LORD, for thy Name's sake; * and for thy righteousness'
      sake bring my soul out of trouble.<BR>
      12 And of thy goodness slay mine enemies, * and destroy all them
      that vex my soul; for I am thy servant.</P>
