    <p><strong>Psalm 119. (Cont)<br />
      V. Legem pone.</strong><br />
      TEACH me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes, * and I shall keep it unto the end.<br />
      34 Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; * yea, I shall keep it with my whole heart.<br />
      35 Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; * for therein is my desire.<br />
      36 Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, * and not to covetousness.<br />
      37 O turn away mine eyes, lest they behold vanity; * and quicken thou me in thy way.<br />
      38 O stablish thy word in thy servant, * that I may fear thee.<br />
      39 Take away the rebuke that I am afraid of; * for thy judgments are good.<br />
      40 Behold, my delight is in thy commandments; * O quicken me in thy righteousness.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>VI. Et veniat super me.</strong><br />
      LET thy loving mercy come also unto me, O LORD, * even thy salvation, according unto thy word.<br />
      42 So shall I make answer unto my blasphemers; * for my trust is in thy word.<br />
      43 O take not the word of thy truth utterly out of my mouth; * for my hope is in thy judgments.<br />
      44 So shall I alway keep thy law; * yea, for ever and ever.<br />
      45 And I will walk at liberty; * for I seek thy commandments.<br />
      46 I will speak of thy testimonies also, even before kings, * and will not be ashamed.<br />
      47 And my delight shall be in thy commandments, * which I have loved.<br />
      48 My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved; * and my study shall be in thy statutes.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>VII. Memor esto verbi tui.</strong><br />
      O THINK upon thy servant, as concerning thy word, * wherein thou hast caused me to put my trust.<br />
      50 The same is my comfort in my trouble; * for thy word hath quickened me.<br />
      51 The proud have had me exceedingly in derision; * yet have I not shrinked from thy law.<br />
      52 For I remembered thine everlasting judgments, O LORD, * and received comfort.<br />
      53 I am horribly afraid, * for the ungodly that forsake thy law.<br />
      54 Thy statutes have been my songs, * in the house of my pilgrimage.<br />
      55 I have thought upon thy Name, O LORD, in the night season, * and have kept thy law.<br />
      56 This I had, * because I kept thy commandments.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>VIII. Portio mea, Domine.</strong><br />
      THOU art my portion, O LORD; * I have promised to keep thy law.<br />
      58 I made my humble petition in thy presence with my whole heart; * O be merciful unto me, according to thy word.<br />
      59 I called mine own ways to remembrance, * and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.<br />
      60 I made haste, and prolonged not the time, * to keep thy commandments.<br />
      61 The snares of the ungodly have compassed me about; * but I have not forgotten thy law.<br />
      62 At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee, * because of thy righteous judgments.<br />
      63 I am a companion of all them that fear thee, * and keep thy commandments.<br />
      64 The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: * O teach me thy statutes.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>IX. Bonitatem fecisti.</strong><br />
      O LORD, thou hast dealt graciously with thy servant, * according unto thy word.<br />
      66 O teach me true understanding and knowledge; * for I have believed thy commandments.<br />
      67 Before I was troubled, I went wrong; * but now have I kept thy word.<br />
      68 Thou art good and gracious; * O teach me thy statutes.<br />
      69 The proud have imagined a lie against me; * but I will keep thy commandments with my whole heart.<br />
      70 Their heart is as fat as brawn; * but my delight hath been in thy law.<br />
      71 It is good for me that I have been in trouble; * that I may learn thy statutes.<br />
    72 The law of thy mouth is dearer unto me * than thousands of gold and silver.
