    <p><strong>Psalm 90. Domine, refugium.</strong><br />
      LORD, thou hast been our refuge, * from one generation to another.<br />
      2 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and the world were made, * thou art God from everlasting, and world without end.<br />
      3 Thou turnest man to destruction; * again thou sayest, Come again, ye children of men.<br />
      4 For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, * and as a watch in the night.<br />
      5 As soon as thou scatterest them they are even as a sleep; * and fade away suddenly like the grass.<br />
      6 In the morning it is green, and groweth up; * but in the evening it is cut down, dried up, and withered.<br />
      7 For we consume away in thy displeasure, * and are afraid at thy wrathful indignation.<br />
      8 Thou hast set our misdeeds before thee; * and our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.<br />
      9 For when thou art angry all our days are gone: * we bring our years to an end, as it were a tale that is told.<br />
      10 The days of our age are threescore years and ten; and though men be so strong that they come to fourscore years, * yet is their strength then but labour and sorrow; so soon passeth it away, and we are gone.<br />
      11 But who regardeth the power of thy wrath? * or feareth aright thy indignation?<br />
      12 So teach us to number our days, * that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.<br />
      13 Turn thee again, O LORD, at the last, * and be gracious unto thy servants.<br />
      14 O satisfy us with thy mercy, and that soon: * so shall we rejoice and be glad all the days of our life.<br />
      15 Comfort us again now after the time that thou hast plagued us; * and for the years wherein we have suffered adversity.<br />
      16 Show thy servants thy work, * and their children thy glory.<br />
      17 And the glorious majesty of the LORD our God be upon us: * prosper thou the work of our hands upon us; O prosper thou our handy-work.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 91. Qui habitat.</strong><br />
      WHOSO dwelleth under the defence of the Most High, * shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.<br />
      2 I will say unto the LORD, Thou art my hope, and my stronghold; * my God, in him will I trust.<br />
      3 For he shall deliver thee from the snare of the hunter, * and from the noisome pestilence.<br />
      4 He shall defend thee under his wings, and thou shalt be safe under his feathers; * his faithfulness and truth shall be thy shield and buckler.<br />
      5 Thou shalt not be afraid for any terror by night, * nor for the arrow that flieth by day;<br />
      6 For the pestilence that walketh in darkness, * nor for the sickness that destroyeth in the noon-day.<br />
      7 A thousand shall fall beside thee, and ten thousand at thy right hand; * but it shall not come nigh thee.<br />
      8 Yea, with thine eyes shalt thou behold, * and see the reward of the ungodly.<br />
      9 For thou, LORD, art my hope; * thou hast set thine house of defence very high.<br />
      10 There shall no evil happen unto thee, * neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.<br />
      11 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, * to keep thee in all thy ways.<br />
      12 They shall bear thee in their hands, * that thou hurt not thy foot against a stone.<br />
      13 Thou shalt go upon the lion and adder: * the young lion and the dragon shalt thou tread under thy feet.<br />
      14 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him; * I will set him up, because he hath known my Name.<br />
      15 He shall call upon me, and I will hear him; * yea, I am with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and bring him to honour.<br />
      16 With long life will I satisfy him, * and show him my salvation.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 92. Bonum est confiteri.</strong><br />
      IT is a good thing to give thanks unto the LORD, * and to sing praises unto thy Name, O Most Highest;<br />
      2 To tell of thy loving-kindness early in the morning, * and of thy truth in the night season;<br />
      3 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the lute; * upon a loud instrument, and upon the harp.<br />
      4 For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy works; * and I will rejoice in giving praise for the operations of thy hands.<br />
      5 O LORD, how glorious are thy works! * thy thoughts are very deep.<br />
      6 An unwise man doth not well consider this, * and a fool doth not understand it.<br />
      7 When the ungodly are green as the grass, and when all the workers of wickedness do flourish, * then shall they be destroyed for ever; but thou, LORD, art the Most Highest for evermore.<br />
      8 For lo, thine enemies, O LORD, lo, thine enemies shall perish; * and all the workers of wickedness shall be destroyed.<br />
      9 But my horn shall be exalted like the horn of an unicorn; * for I am anointed with fresh oil.<br />
      10 Mine eye also shall see his lust of mine enemies, * and mine ear shall hear his desire of the wicked that arise up against me.<br />
      11 The righteous shall flourish like a palm-tree, * and shall spread abroad like a cedar in Lebanon.<br />
      12 Such as are planted in the house of the LORD, * shall flourish in the courts of the house of our God.<br />
      13 They also shall bring forth more fruit in their age, * and shall be fat and well-liking;<br />
    14 That they may show how true the LORD my strength is, * and that there is no unrighteousness in him.
