      The First Day.<BR>
<BR>
      Morning Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 1. Beatus vir qui non abiit.</B><BR>
      BLESSED is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the
      ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, * and hath not sat
      in the seat of the scornful.<BR>
      2 But his delight is in the law of the LORD; * and in his law
      will he exercise himself day and night.<BR>
      3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the water-side, * that
      will bring forth his fruit in due season.<BR>
      4 His leaf also shall not wither; * and look, whatsoever he doeth,
      it shall prosper.<BR>
      5 As for the ungodly, it is not so with them; * but they are
      like the chaff, which the wind scattereth away from the face
      of the earth.<BR>
      6 Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stand in the judgment,
      * neither the sinners in the congregation of the righteous.<BR>
      7 But the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous; * and the way
      of the ungodly shall perish.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 2. Quare fremuerunt gentes?</B><BR>
      WHY do the heathen so furiously rage together? * and why do the
      people imagine a vain thing?<BR>
      2 The kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take counsel
      together * against the LORD, and against his Anointed:<BR>
      3 Let us break their bonds asunder, * and cast away their cords
      from us.<BR>
      4 He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh them to scorn: * the
      Lord shall have them in derision.<BR>
      5 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, * and vex them
      in his sore displeasure:<BR>
      6 Yet have I set my King * upon my holy hill of Sion.<BR>
      7 I will rehearse the decree; * the LORD hath said unto me, Thou
      art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.<BR>
      8 Desire of me, and I shall give thee the nations for thine inheritance,
      * and the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession.<BR>
      9 Thou shalt bruise them with a rod of iron, * and break them
      in pieces like a potter's vessel.<BR>
      10 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings; * be instructed, ye that
      are judges of the earth.<BR>
      11 Serve the LORD in fear, * and rejoice unto him with reverence.<BR>
      12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and so ye perish from the
      right way, if his wrath be kindled, yea but a little. * Blessed
      are all they that put their trust in him.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 3. Domine, quid multiplicati?</B><BR>
      LORD, how are they increased that trouble me! * many are they
      that rise against me.<BR>
      2 Many one there be that say of my soul, * There is no help for
      him in his God.<BR>
      3 But thou, O LORD, art my defender; * thou art my worship, and
      the lifter up of my head.<BR>
      4 I did call upon the LORD with my voice, * and he heard me out
      of his holy hill.<BR>
      5 I laid me down and slept, and rose up again; * for the LORD
      sustained me.<BR>
      6 I will not be afraid for ten thousands of the people, * that
      have set themselves against me round about.<BR>
      7 UP, LORD, and help me, O my God, * for thou smitest all mine
      enemies upon the cheek-bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the
      ungodly.<BR>
      8 Salvation belongeth unto the LORD; * and thy blessing is upon
      thy people.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 4. Cum invocarem.</B><BR>
      HEAR me when I call, O God of my righteousness: * thou hast set
      me at liberty when I was in trouble; have mercy upon me, and
      hearken unto my prayer.<BR>
      2 O ye sons of men, how long will ye blaspheme mine honour, *
      and have such pleasure in vanity, and seek after falsehood?<BR>
      3 Know this also, that the LORD hath chosen to himself the man
      that is godly; * when I call upon the LORD he will hear me.<BR>
      4 Stand in awe, and sin not; * commune with your own heart, and
      in your chamber, and be still.<BR>
      5 Offer the sacrifice of righteousness, * and put your trust
      in the LORD.<BR>
      6 There be many that say, * Who will show us any good?<BR>
      7 LORD, lift thou up* the light of thy countenance upon us.<BR>
      8 Thou hast put gladness in my heart; * yea, more than when their
      corn and wine and oil increase.<BR>
      9 I will lay me down in peace, and take my rest; * for it is
      thou, LORD, only, that makest me dwell in safety.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 5. Verba mea auribus.</B><BR>
      PONDER my words, O LORD, * consider my meditation.<BR>
      2 O hearken thou unto the voice of my calling, my King and my
      God: * for unto thee will I make my prayer.<BR>
      3 My voice shalt thou hear betimes, O LORD; * early in the morning
      will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.<BR>
      4 For thou art the God that hast no pleasure in wickedness; *
      neither shall any evil dwell with thee.<BR>
      5 Such as be foolish shall not stand in thy sight; * for thou
      hatest all them that work iniquity.<BR>
      6 Thou shalt destroy them that speak lies: * the LORD will abhor
      both the blood-thirsty and deceitful man.<BR>
      7 But as for me, in the multitude of thy mercy I will come into
      thine house; * and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy
      temple.<BR>
      8 Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness, because of mine enemies;
      * make thy way plain before my face.<BR>
      9 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; * their inward
      parts are very wickedness.<BR>
      10 Their throat is an open sepulchre; * they flatter with their
      tongue.<BR>
      11 Destroy thou them, O God; let them perish through their own
      imaginations; * cast them out in the multitude of their ungodliness;
      for they have rebelled against thee.<BR>
      12 And let all them that put their trust in thee rejoice: * they
      shall ever be giving of thanks, because thou defendest them;
      they that love thy Name shall be joyful in thee;<BR>
      13 For thou, LORD, wilt give thy blessing unto the righteous,
      * and with thy favourable kindness wilt thou defend him as with
      a shield.<BR>

      <P><CENTER><A NAME="anchor420268"></A>Evening Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 6. Domine, ne in furore.</B><BR>
      O LORD, rebuke me not in thine indignation, * neither chasten
      me in thy displeasure.<BR>
      2 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am weak; * O LORD, heal me,
      for my bones are vexed.<BR>
      3 My soul also is sore troubled: * but, LORD, how long wilt thou
      punish me?<BR>
      4 Turn thee, O LORD, and deliver my soul; * O save me, for thy
      mercy's sake.<BR>
      5 For in death no man remembereth thee; * and who will give thee
      thanks in the pit?<BR>
      6 I am weary of my groaning; * every night wash I my bed, and
      water my couch with my tears.<BR>
      7 My beauty is gone for very trouble, * and worn away because
      of all mine enemies.<BR>
      8 Away from me, all ye that work iniquity; * for the LORD hath
      heard the voice of my weeping.<BR>
      9 The LORD hath heard my petition; * the LORD will receive my
      prayer.<BR>
      10 All mine enemies shall be confounded, and sore vexed; * they
      shall be turned back, and put to shame suddenly.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 7. Domine, Deus meus.</B><BR>
      O LORD my God, in thee have I put my trust: * save me from all
      them that persecute me, and deliver me;<BR>
      2 Lest he devour my soul like a lion, and tear it in pieces,
      * while there is none to help.<BR>
      3 O LORD my God, if I have done any such thing; * or if there
      be any wickedness in my hands;<BR>
      4 If I have rewarded evil unto him that dealt friendly with me;
      * (yea, I have delivered him that without any cause is mine enemy;)<BR>
      5 Then let mine enemy persecute my soul, and take me; * yea,
      let him tread my life down upon the earth, and lay mine honour
      in the dust.<BR>
      6 Stand up, O LORD, in thy wrath, and lift up thyself, because
      of the indignation of mine enemies; * arise up for me in the
      judgment that thou hast commanded.<BR>
      7 And so shall the congregation of the peoples come about thee:
      * for their sakes therefore lift up thyself again.<BR>
      8 The LORD shall judge the peoples: give sentence with me, O
      LORD, * according to my righteousness, and according to the innocency
      that is in me.<BR>
      9 O let the wickedness of the ungodly come to an end; * but guide
      thou the just.<BR>
      10 For the righteous God * trieth the very hearts and reins.<BR>
      11 My help cometh of God, * who preserveth them that are true
      of heart.<BR>
      12 God is a righteous Judge, strong, and patient; * and God is
      provoked every day.<BR>
      13 If a man will not turn, he will whet his sword; * he hath
      bent his bow, and made it ready.<BR>
      14 He hath prepared for him the instruments of death; * he ordaineth
      his arrows against the persecutors.<BR>
      15 Behold, the ungodly travaileth with iniquity; * he hath conceived
      mischief, and brought forth falsehood.<BR>
      16 He hath graven and digged up a pit, * and is fallen himself
      into the destruction that he made for other.<BR>
      17 For his travail shall come upon his own head, * and his wickedness
      shall fall on his own pate.<BR>
      18 I will give thanks unto the LORD, according to his righteousness;
      * and I will praise the Name of the LORD Most High.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 8. Domine, Dominus noster.</B><BR>
      O LORD our Governor, how excellent is thy Name in all the world;
      * thou that hast set thy glory above the heavens!<BR>
      2 Out of the mouth of very babes and sucklings hast thou ordained
      strength, because of thine enemies, * that thou mightest still
      the enemy and the avenger.<BR>
      3 When I consider thy heavens, even the work of thy fingers;
      * the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained;<BR>
      4 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? * and the son of
      man, that thou visitest him?<BR>
      5 Thou madest him lower than the angels, * to crown him with
      glory and worship.<BR>
      6 Thou makest him to have dominion of the works of thy hands;
      * and thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet:<BR>
      7 All sheep and oxen; * yea, and the beasts of the field;<BR>
      8 The fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea; * and whatsoever
      walketh through the paths of the seas.<BR>
      9 O LORD our Governor, * how excellent is thy Name in all the
      world!</P>
