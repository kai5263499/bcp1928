    <p><strong>Psalm 19. Caeli enarrant.</strong><br />
      THE heavens declare the glory of God; * and the firmament showeth his handy-work.<br />
      2 One day telleth another; * and one night certifieth another.<br />
      3 There is neither speech nor language; * but their voices are heard among them.<br />
      4 Their sound is gone out into all lands; * and their words into the ends of the world.<br />
      5 In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun; * which cometh forth as a bridegroom out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a giant to run his course.<br />
      6 It goeth forth from the uttermost part of the heaven, and runneth about unto the end of it again; * and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.<br />
      7 The law of the LORD is an undefiled law, converting the soul; * the testimony of the LORD is sure, and giveth wisdom unto the simple.<br />
      8 The statutes of the LORD are right, and rejoice the heart; * the commandment of the LORD is pure, and giveth light unto the eyes.<br />
      9 The fear of the LORD is clean, and endureth for ever; * the judgments of the LORD are true, and righteous altogether.<br />
      10 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold; * sweeter also than honey, and the honeycomb.<br />
      11 Moreover, by them is thy servant taught; * and in keeping of them there is great reward.<br />
      12 Who can tell how oft he offendeth? * O cleanse thou me from my secret faults.<br />
      13 Keep thy servant also from presumptuous sins, lest they get the dominion over me; * so shall I be undefiled, and innocent from the great offence.<br />
    14 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be alway acceptable in thy sight, * O LORD, my strength and my redeemer.</p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 20. Exaudiat te Dominus.</strong><br />
      THE LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; * the Name of the God of Jacob defend thee:<br />
      2 Send thee help from the sanctuary, * and strengthen thee out of Sion:<br />
      3 Remember all thy offerings, * and accept thy burnt-sacrifice:<br />
      4 Grant thee thy heart's desire, * and fulfil all thy mind.<br />
      5 We will rejoice in thy salvation, and triumph in the Name of the Lord our God: * the LORD perform all thy petitions.<br />
      6 Now know I that the LORD helpeth his anointed, and will hear him from his holy heaven, * even with the wholesome strength of his right hand.<br />
      7 Some put their trust in chariots, and some in horses; * but we will remember the Name of the LORD our God.<br />
      8 They are brought down and fallen; * but we are risen and stand upright.<br />
      9 Save, LORD; and hear us, O King of heaven, * when we call upon thee.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 21. Domine, in virtute tua.</strong><br />
      THE King shall rejoice in thy strength, O LORD; * exceeding glad shall he be of thy salvation.<br />
      2 Thou hast given him his heart's desire, * and hast not denied him the request of his lips.<br />
      3 For thou shalt meet him with the blessings of goodness, * and shalt set a crown of pure gold upon his head.<br />
      4 He asked life of thee; and thou gavest him a long life, * even for ever and ever.<br />
      5 His honour is great in thy salvation; * glory and great worship shalt thou lay upon him.<br />
      6 For thou shalt give him everlasting felicity, * and make him glad with the joy of thy countenance.<br />
      7 And why? because the King putteth his trust in the LORD; * and in the mercy of the Most Highest he shall not miscarry.<br />
      8 All thine enemies shall feel thine hand; * thy right hand shall find out them that hate thee.<br />
      9 Thou shalt make them like a fiery oven in time of thy wrath: * the LORD shall destroy them in his displeasure, and the fire shall consume them.<br />
      10 Their fruit shalt thou root out of the earth, * and their seed from among the children of men.<br />
      11 For they intended mischief against thee, * and imagined such a device as they are not able to perform.<br />
      12 Therefore shalt thou put them to flight, * and the strings of thy bow shalt thou make ready against the face of them.<br />
    13 Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength; * so will we sing, and praise thy power.
