    <p><strong>Psalm 139. Domine, probasti.</strong><br />
      O LORD, thou hast searched me out, and known me. * Thou knowest my down-sitting, and mine uprising; thou understandest my thoughts long before.<br />
      2 Thou art about my path, and about my bed; * and art acquainted with all my ways.<br />
      3 For lo, there is not a word in my tongue, * but thou, O LORD, knowest it altogether.<br />
      4 Thou hast beset me behind and before, * and laid thine hand upon me.<br />
      5 Such knowledge is too wonderful and excellent for me; * I cannot attain unto it.<br />
      6 Whither shall I go then from thy Spirit? * or whither shall I go then from thy presence?<br />
      7 If I climb up into heaven, thou art there; * if I go down to hell, thou art there also.<br />
      8 If I take the wings of the morning, * and remain in the uttermost parts of the sea;<br />
      9 Even there also shall thy hand lead me, * and thy right hand shall hold me.<br />
      10 If I say, Peradventure the darkness shall cover me; * then shall my night be turned to day.<br />
      11 Yea, the darkness is no darkness with thee, but the night is as clear as the day; * the darkness and light to thee are both alike.<br />
      12 For my reins are thine; * thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.<br />
      13 I will give thanks unto thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: * marvellous are thy works, and that my soul knoweth right well.<br />
      14 My bones are not hid from thee, * though I be made secretly, and fashioned beneath in the earth.<br />
      15 Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being imperfect; * and in thy book were all my members written;<br />
      16 Which day by day were fashioned, * when as yet there was none of them.<br />
      17 How dear are thy counsels unto me, O God; * O how great is the sum of them!<br />
      18 If I tell them, they are more in number than the sand: * when I wake up, I am present with thee.<br />
      19 Wilt thou not slay the wicked, O God? * Depart from me, ye blood-thirsty men.<br />
      20 For they speak unrighteously against thee; * and thine enemies take thy Name in vain.<br />
      21 Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? * and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?<br />
      22 Yea, I hate them right sore; * even as though they were mine enemies.<br />
      23 Try me, O God, and seek the ground of my heart; * prove me, and examine my thoughts.<br />
      24 Look well if there be any way of wickedness in me; * and lead me in the way everlasting.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 140. Eripe me, Domine.</strong><br />
      DELIVER me, O LORD, from the evil man; * and preserve me from the wicked man;<br />
      2 Who imagine mischief in their hearts, * and stir up strife all the day long.<br />
      3 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; * adder's poison is under their lips.<br />
      4 Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the ungodly; * preserve me from the wicked men, who are purposed to overthrow my goings.<br />
      5 The proud have laid a snare for me, and spread a net abroad with cords; * yea, and set traps in my way.<br />
      6 I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God, * hear the voice of my prayers, O LORD.<br />
      7 O LORD God, thou strength of my health; * thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.<br />
      8 Let not the ungodly have his desire, O LORD; * let not his mischievous imagination prosper, lest they be too proud.<br />
      9 Let the mischief of their own lips fall upon the head of them * that compass me about.<br />
      10 Let hot burning coals fall upon them; * let them be cast into the fire, and into the pit, that they never rise up again.<br />
      11 A man full of words shall not prosper upon the earth: * evil shall hunt the wicked person to overthrow him.<br />
      12 Sure I am that the LORD will avenge the poor, * and maintain the cause of the helpless.<br />
    13 The righteous also shall give thanks unto thy Name; * and the just shall continue in thy sight.
