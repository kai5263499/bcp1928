    <p><strong>Psalm 69. Salvum me fac.</strong><br />
      SAVE me, O God; * for the waters are come in, even unto my soul.<br />
      2 I stick fast in the deep mire, where no ground is; * I am come into deep waters, so that the floods run over me.<br />
      3 I am weary of crying; my throat is dry; * my sight faileth me for waiting so long upon my God.<br />
      4 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head; * they that are mine enemies, and would destroy me guiltless, are mighty.<br />
      5 I paid them the things that I never took: * God, thou knowest my simpleness, and my faults are not hid from thee.<br />
      6 Let not them that trust in thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my cause; * let not those that seek thee be confounded through me, O Lord God of Israel.<br />
      7 And why? for thy sake have I suffered reproof; * shame hath covered my face.<br />
      8 I am become a stranger unto my brethren, * even an alien unto my mother's children.<br />
      9 For the zeal of thine house hath even eaten me; * and the rebukes of them that rebuked thee are fallen upon me.<br />
      10 I wept, and chastened myself with fasting, * and that was turned to my reproof.<br />
      11 I put on sackcloth also, * and they jested upon me.<br />
      12 They that sit in the gate speak against me, * and the drunkards make songs upon me.<br />
      13 But, LORD, I make my prayer unto thee * in an acceptable time.<br />
      14 Hear me, O God, in the multitude of thy mercy, * even in the truth of thy salvation.<br />
      15 Take me out of the mire, that I sink not; * O let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.<br />
      16 Let not the water-flood drown me, neither let the deep swallow me up; * and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.<br />
      17 Hear me, O LORD, for thy loving-kindness is comfortable; * turn thee unto me according to the multitude of thy mercies.<br />
      18 And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: * O haste thee, and hear me.<br />
      19 Draw nigh unto my soul, and save it; * O deliver me, because of mine enemies.<br />
      20 Thou hast known my reproach, my shame, and my dishonour: * mine adversaries are all in thy sight.<br />
      21 Reproach hath broken my heart; I am full of heaviness: * I looked for some to have pity on me, but there was no man, neither found I any to comfort me.<br />
      22 They gave me gall to eat; * and when I was thirsty they gave me vinegar to drink.<br />
      23 Let their table be made a snare to take themselves withal; * and let the things that should have been for their wealth be unto them an occasion of falling.<br />
      24 Let their eyes be blinded, that they see not; * and ever bow thou down their backs.<br />
      25 Pour out thine indignation upon them, * and let thy wrathful displeasure take hold of them.<br />
      26 Let their habitation be void, * and no man to dwell in their tents.<br />
      27 For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; * and they talk how they may vex them whom thou hast wounded.<br />
      28 Let them fall from one wickedness to another, * and not come into thy righteousness.<br />
      29 Let them be wiped out of the book of the living, * and not be written among the righteous.<br />
      30 As for me, when I am poor and in heaviness, * thy help, O God, shall lift me up.<br />
      31 I will praise the Name of God with a song, * and magnify it with thanksgiving.<br />
      32 This also shall please the LORD * better than a bullock that hath horns and hoofs.<br />
      33 The humble shall consider this, and be glad: * seek ye after God, and your soul shall live.<br />
      34 For the LORD heareth the poor, * and despiseth not his prisoners.<br />
      35 Let heaven and earth praise him: * the sea, and all that moveth therein.<br />
      36 For God will save Sion, and build the cities of Judah, * that men may dwell there, and have it in possession.<br />
      37 The posterity also of his servants shall inherit it; * and they that love his Name shall dwell therein.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 70. Deus, in adjutorium.</strong><br />
      HASTE thee, O God, to deliver me; * make haste to help me, O LORD.<br />
      2 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul; * let them be turned backward and put to confusion that wish me evil.<br />
      3 Let them for their reward be soon brought to shame, * that cry over me, There! there!<br />
      4 But let all those that seek thee be joyful and glad in thee: * and let all such as delight in thy salvation say alway, The Lord be praised.<br />
      5 As for me, I am poor and in misery: * haste thee unto me, O God.<br />
    6 Thou art my helper, and my redeemer: * O LORD, make no long tarrying.
