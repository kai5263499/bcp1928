      <P><B>Psalm 119. I. Beati immaculati.</B><BR />
      BLESSED are those that are undefiled in the way, and walk in
      the law of the LORD.<BR />
      2 Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, * and seek him
      with their whole heart;<BR />
      3 Even they who do no wickedness, * and walk in his ways.<BR />
      4 Thou hast charged * that we shall diligently keep thy commandments.<BR />
      5 O that my ways were made so direct, * that I might keep thy
      statutes!<BR />
      6 So shall I not be confounded, * while I have respect unto all
      thy commandments.<BR />
      7 I will thank thee with an unfeigned heart, * when I shall have
      learned the judgments of thy righteousness.<BR />
      8 I will keep thy statutes; * O forsake me not utterly.<BR />
<BR />
      II. In quo corrigit?<BR />
      <A NAME="anchor4635221"></A>WHEREWITHAL shall a young man cleanse
      his way? * even by ruling himself after thy word.<BR />
      10 With my whole heart have I sought thee; * O let me not go
      wrong out of thy commandments.<BR />
      11 Thy word have I hid within my heart, * that I should not sin
      against thee.<BR />
      12 Blessed art thou, O LORD; * O teach me thy statutes.<BR />
      13 With my lips have I been telling * of all the judgments of
      thy mouth.<BR />
      14 I have had as great delight in the way of thy testimonies,
      * as in all manner of riches.<BR />
      15 I will talk of thy commandments, * and have respect unto thy
      ways.<BR />
      16 My delight shall be in thy statutes, * and I will not forget
      thy word.<BR />
<BR />
      III. Retribue servo tuo.<BR />
      <A NAME="anchor4062665"></A>O DO well unto thy servant; * that
      I may live, and keep thy word.<BR />
      18 Open thou mine eyes; * that I may see the wondrous things
      of thy law.<BR />
      19 I am a stranger upon earth; * O hide not thy commandments
      from me.<BR />
      20 My soul breaketh out for the very fervent desire * that it
      hath alway unto thy judgments.<BR />
      21 Thou hast rebuked the proud; * and cursed are they that do
      err from thy commandments.<BR />
      22 O turn from me shame and rebuke; * for I have kept thy testimonies.<BR />
      23 Princes also did sit and speak against me; * but thy servant
      is occupied in thy statutes.<BR />
      24 For thy testimonies are my delight, * and my counsellors.<BR />
<BR />
      IV. Adhaesit pavimento.<BR />
      MY soul cleaveth to the dust; * O quicken thou me, according
      to thy word.<BR />
      26 I have acknowledged my ways, and thou heardest me: * O teach
      me thy statutes.<BR />
      27 Make me to understand the way of thy commandments; * and so
      shall I talk of thy wondrous works.<BR />
      28 My soul melteth away for very heaviness; * comfort thou me
      according unto thy word.<BR />
      29 Take from me the way of lying, * and cause thou me to make
      much of thy law.<BR />
      30 I have chosen the way of truth, * and thy judgments have I
      laid before me.<BR />
      31 I have stuck unto thy testimonies; * O LORD, confound me not.<BR />
      32 I will run the way of thy commandments, * when thou hast set
      my heart at liberty.</P>

      <P><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER></P>

      <P>V. Legem pone.<BR />
      <A NAME="anchor434966"></A>TEACH me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes,
      * and I shall keep it unto the end.<BR />
      34 Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; * yea, I
      shall keep it with my whole heart.<BR />
      35 Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; * for therein
      is my desire.<BR />
      36 Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, * and not to covetousness.<BR />
      37 O turn away mine eyes, lest they behold vanity; * and quicken
      thou me in thy way.<BR />
      38 O stablish thy word in thy servant, * that I may fear thee.<BR />
      39 Take away the rebuke that I am afraid of; * for thy judgments
      are good.<BR />
      40 Behold, my delight is in thy commandments; * O quicken me
      in thy righteousness.<BR />
<BR />
      VI. Et veniat super me.<BR />
      LET thy loving mercy come also unto me, O LORD, * even thy salvation,
      according unto thy word.<BR />
      42 So shall I make answer unto my blasphemers; * for my trust
      is in thy word.<BR />
      43 O take not the word of thy truth utterly out of my mouth;
      * for my hope is in thy judgments.<BR />
      44 So shall I alway keep thy law; * yea, for ever and ever.<BR />
      45 And I will walk at liberty; * for I seek thy commandments.<BR />
      46 I will speak of thy testimonies also, even before kings, *
      and will not be ashamed.<BR />
      47 And my delight shall be in thy commandments, * which I have
      loved.<BR />
      48 My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which
      I have loved; * and my study shall be in thy statutes.<BR />
<BR />
      VII. Memor esto verbi tui.<BR />
      <A NAME="anchor1042462"></A>O THINK upon thy servant, as concerning
      thy word, * wherein thou hast caused me to put my trust.<BR />
      50 The same is my comfort in my trouble; * for thy word hath
      quickened me.<BR />
      51 The proud have had me exceedingly in derision; * yet have
      I not shrinked from thy law.<BR />
      52 For I remembered thine everlasting judgments, O LORD, * and
      received comfort.<BR />
      53 I am horribly afraid, * for the ungodly that forsake thy law.<BR />
      54 Thy statutes have been my songs, * in the house of my pilgrimage.<BR />
      55 I have thought upon thy Name, O LORD, in the night season,
      * and have kept thy law.<BR />
      56 This I had, * because I kept thy commandments.<BR />
<BR />
<BR />
      VIII. Portio mea, Domine.<BR />
      THOU art my portion, O LORD; * I have promised to keep thy law.<BR />
      58 I made my humble petition in thy presence with my whole heart;
      * O be merciful unto me, according to thy word.<BR />
      59 I called mine own ways to remembrance, * and turned my feet
      unto thy testimonies.<BR />
      60 I made haste, and prolonged not the time, * to keep thy commandments.<BR />
      61 The snares of the ungodly have compassed me about; * but I
      have not forgotten thy law.<BR />
      62 At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee, * because
      of thy righteous judgments.<BR />
      63 I am a companion of all them that fear thee, * and keep thy
      commandments.<BR />
      64 The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: * O teach me thy
      statutes.<BR />
<BR />
      IX. Bonitatem fecisti.<BR />
      <A NAME="anchor1192534"></A>O LORD, thou hast dealt graciously
      with thy servant, * according unto thy word.<BR />
      66 O teach me true understanding and knowledge; * for I have
      believed thy commandments.<BR />
      67 Before I was troubled, I went wrong; * but now have I kept
      thy word.<BR />
      68 Thou art good and gracious; * O teach me thy statutes.<BR />
      69 The proud have imagined a lie against me; * but I will keep
      thy commandments with my whole heart.<BR />
      70 Their heart is as fat as brawn; * but my delight hath been
      in thy law.<BR />
      71 It is good for me that I have been in trouble; * that I may
      learn thy statutes.<BR />
      72 The law of thy mouth is dearer unto me * than thousands of
      gold and silver.</P>

      <P><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER></P>

      <P>X. Manus tuae fecerunt me.<BR />
      THY hands have made me and fashioned me: * O give me understanding,
      that I may learn thy commandments.<BR />
      74 They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; * because
      I have put my trust in thy word.<BR />
      75 I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, * and that thou
      of very faithfulness hast caused me to be troubled.<BR />
      76 O let thy merciful kindness be my comfort, * according to
      thy word unto thy servant.<BR />
      77 O let thy loving mercies come unto me, that I may live; *
      for thy law is my delight.<BR />
      78 Let the proud be confounded, for they go wickedly about to
      destroy me; * but I will be occupied in thy commandments.<BR />
      79 Let such as fear thee, and have known thy testimonies, * be
      turned unto me.<BR />
      80 O let my heart be sound in thy statutes, * that I be not ashamed.<BR />
<BR />
<BR />
      XI. Defecit anima mea.<BR />
      <A NAME="anchor1212542"></A>MY soul hath longed for thy salvation,
      * and I have a good hope because of thy word.<BR />
      82 Mine eyes-long sore for thy word; * saying, O when wilt thou
      comfort me?<BR />
      83 For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; * yet do I not
      forget thy statutes.<BR />
      84 How many are the days of thy servant? * when wilt thou be
      avenged of them that persecute me?<BR />
      85 The proud have digged pits for me, * which are not after thy
      law.<BR />
      86 All thy commandments are true: * they persecute me falsely;
      O be thou my help.<BR />
      87 They had almost made an end of me upon earth; * but I forsook
      not thy commandments.<BR />
      88 O quicken me after thy loving-kindness; * and so shall I keep
      the testimonies of thy mouth.<BR />
<BR />
<BR />
      <A NAME="anchor3348245"></A>XII. In aeternum, Domine.<BR />
      O LORD, thy word * endureth for ever in heaven.<BR />
      90 Thy truth also remaineth from one generation to another; *
      thou hast laid the foundation of the earth, and it abideth.<BR />
      91 They continue this day according to thine ordinance; * for
      all things serve thee.<BR />
      92 If my delight had not been in thy law, * I should have perished
      in my trouble.<BR />
      93 I will never forget thy commandments; * for with them thou
      hast quickened me.<BR />
      94 I am thine: O save me, * for I have sought thy commandments.<BR />
      95 The ungodly laid wait for me, to destroy me; * but I will
      consider thy testimonies.<BR />
      96 I see that all things come to an end; * but thy commandment
      is exceeding broad.<BR />
<BR />
<BR />
      <A NAME="anchor1210419"></A>XIII. Quomodo dilexi!<BR />
      LORD, what love have I unto thy law! * all the day long is my
      study in it.<BR />
      98 Thou, through thy commandments, hast made me wiser than mine
      enemies; * for they are ever with me.<BR />
      99 I have more understanding than my teachers; * for thy testimonies
      are my study.<BR />
      100 I am wiser than the aged; * because I keep thy commandments.<BR />
      101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, * that I may
      keep thy word.<BR />
      102 I have not shrunk from thy judgments; * for thou teachest
      me.<BR />
      103 O how sweet are thy words unto my throat; * yea, sweeter
      than honey unto my mouth!<BR />
      104 Through thy commandments I get understanding: * therefore
      I hate all evil ways.</P>

      <P><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER></P>

      <P>XIV. Lucerna pedibus meis.<BR />
      THY word is a lantern unto my feet, * and a light unto my paths.<BR />
      106 I have sworn, and am stedfastly purposed, * to keep thy righteous
      judgments.<BR />
      107 I am troubled above measure: * quicken me, O LORD, according
      to thy word.<BR />
      108 Let the free-will offerings of my mouth please thee, O LORD;
      * and teach me thy judgments.<BR />
      109 My soul is alway in my hand; * yet do I not forget thy law.<BR />
      110 The ungodly have laid a snare for me; * but yet I swerved
      not from thy commandments.<BR />
      111 Thy testimonies have I claimed as mine heritage for ever;
      * and why? they are the very joy of my heart.<BR />
      112 I have applied my heart to fulfil thy statutes alway, * even
      unto the end.<BR />
<BR />
      <A NAME="anchor3771901"></A>XV. Iniquos odio habui.<BR />
      I HATE them that imagine evil things; * but thy law do I love.<BR />
      114 Thou art my defence and shield; * and my trust is in thy
      word.<BR />
      115 Away from me, ye wicked; * I will keep the commandments of
      my God.<BR />
      116 O stablish me according to thy word, that I may live; * and
      let me not be disappointed of my hope.<BR />
      117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe; * yea, my delight shall
      be ever in thy statutes.<BR />
      118 Thou hast trodden down all them that depart from thy statutes;
      * for they imagine but deceit.<BR />
      119 Thou puttest away all the ungodly of the earth like dross;
      * therefore I love thy testimonies.<BR />
      120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; * and I am afraid of
      thy judgments.<BR />
<BR />
      XVI. Feci judicium.<BR />
      I DEAL with the thing that is lawful and right; * O give me not
      over unto mine oppressors.<BR />
      122 Make thou thy servant to delight in that which is good, *
      that the proud do me no wrong.<BR />
      123 Mine eyes are wasted away with looking for thy health, *
      and for the word of thy righteousness.<BR />
      124 O deal with thy servant according unto thy loving mercy,
      * and teach me thy statutes.<BR />
      125 I am thy servant; O grant me understanding, * that I may
      know thy testimonies.<BR />
      126 It is time for thee, LORD, to lay to thine hand; * for they
      have destroyed thy law.<BR />
      127 For I love thy commandments * above gold and precious stones.<BR />
      128 Therefore hold I straight all thy commandments; * and all
      false ways I utterly abhor.<BR />
<BR />
      <A NAME="anchor3773237"></A>XVII. Mirabilia.<BR />
      THY testimonies are wonderful; * therefore doth my soul keep
      them.<BR />
      130 When thy word goeth forth, * it giveth light and understanding
      unto the simple.<BR />
      131 I opened my mouth, and drew in my breath; * for my delight
      was in thy commandments.<BR />
      132 O look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, * as thou usest
      to do unto those that love thy Name.<BR />
      133 Order my steps in thy word; * and so shall no wickedness
      have dominion over me.<BR />
      134 O deliver me from the wrongful dealings of men; * and so
      shall I keep thy commandments.<BR />
      135 Show the light of thy countenance upon thy servant, * and
      teach me thy statutes.<BR />
      136 Mine eyes gush out with water, * because men keep not thy
      law.<BR />
<BR />
      XVIII. Justus es, Domine.<BR />
      RIGHTEOUS art thou, O LORD; * and true are thy judgments.<BR />
      138 The testimonies that thou hast commanded * are exceeding
      righteous and true.<BR />
      139 My zeal hath even consumed me; * because mine enemies have
      forgotten thy words.<BR />
      140 Thy word is tried to the uttermost, * and thy servant loveth
      it.<BR />
      141 I am small and of no reputation; * yet do I not forget thy
      commandments.<BR />
      142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, * and
      thy law is the truth.<BR />
      143 Trouble and heaviness have taken hold upon me; * yet is my
      delight in thy commandments.<BR />
      144 The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: * O
      grant me understanding, and I shall live.<BR />
      <A NAME="anchor1773739"></A><BR />
      XIX. Clamavi in toto corde meo.<BR />
      I CALL with my whole heart; * hear me, O LORD; I will keep thy
      statutes.<BR />
      146 Yea, even unto thee do I call; * help me, and I shall keep
      thy testimonies.<BR />
      147 Early in the morning do I cry unto thee; * for in thy word
      is my trust.<BR />
      148 Mine eyes prevent the night watches; * that I might be occupied
      in thy word.<BR />
      149 Hear my voice, O LORD, according unto thy lovingkindness;
      * quicken me, according to thy judgments.<BR />
      150 They draw nigh that of malice persecute me, * and are far
      from thy law.<BR />
      151 Be thou nigh at hand, O LORD; * for all thy commandments
      are true.<BR />
      152 As concerning thy testimonies, I have known long since, *
      that thou hast grounded them for ever.<BR />
<BR />
      XX. Vide humilitatem.<BR />
      O CONSIDER mine adversity, and deliver me, * for I do not forget
      thy law.<BR />
      154 Avenge thou my cause, and deliver me; * quicken me according
      to thy word.<BR />
      155 Health is far from the ungodly; * for they regard not thy
      statutes.<BR />
      156 Great is thy mercy, O LORD; * quicken me, as thou art wont.<BR />
      157 Many there are that trouble me, and persecute me; * yet do
      I not swerve from thy testimonies.<BR />
      158 It grieveth me when I see the transgressors; * because they
      keep not thy law.<BR />
      159 Consider, O LORD, how I love thy commandments; * O quicken
      me, according to thy loving-kindness.<BR />
      160 Thy word is true from everlasting; * all the judgments of
      thy righteousness endure for evermore.<BR />
      <A NAME="anchor1770443"></A><BR />
      XXI. Principes persecuti sunt.<BR />
      PRINCES have persecuted me without a cause; * but my heart standeth
      in awe of thy word.<BR />
      162 I am as glad of thy word, * as one that findeth great spoils.<BR />
      163 As for lies, I hate and abhor them; * but thy law do I love. <BR />
      164 Seven times a day do I praise thee; * because of thy righteous
      judgments.<BR />
      165 Great is the peace that they have who love thy law; * and
      they have none occasion of stumbling.<BR />
      166 LORD, I have looked for thy saving health, * and done after
      thy commandments.<BR />
      167 My soul hath kept thy testimonies, * and loved them exceedingly.<BR />
      168 I have kept thy commandments and testimonies; * for all my
      ways are before thee.<BR />
<BR />
      XXII. Appropinquet deprecatio.<BR />
      LET my complaint come before thee, O LORD; * give me understanding
      according to thy word.<BR />
      170 Let my supplication come before thee; * deliver me according
      to thy word.<BR />
      171 My lips shall speak of thy praise, * when thou hast taught
      me thy statutes.<BR />
      172 Yea, my tongue shall sing of thy word; * for all thy commandments
      are righteous.<BR />
      173 Let thine hand help me; * for I have chosen thy commandments.<BR />
      174 I have longed for thy saving health, O LORD; * and in thy
      law is my delight.<BR />
      175 O let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; * and thy judgments
      shall help me.<BR />
      176 I have gone astray like a sheep that is lost; * O seek thy
      servant, for I do not forget thy commandments.
