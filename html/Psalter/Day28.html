<BR>
      Morning Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 132. Memento, Domine.</B><BR>
      LORD, remember David, * and all his trouble:<BR>
      2 How he sware unto the LORD, * and vowed a vow unto the Almighty
      God of Jacob:<BR>
      3 I will not come within the tabernacle of mine house, * nor
      climb up into my bed;<BR>
      4 I will not suffer mine eyes to sleep, nor mine eyelids to slumber;
      * neither the temples of my head to take any rest;<BR>
      5 Until I find out a place for the temple of the LORD; * an habitation
      for the Mighty God of Jacob.<BR>
      6 Lo, we heard of the same at Ephratah, * and found it in the
      wood.<BR>
      7 We will go into his tabernacle, * and fall low on our knees
      before his footstool.<BR>
      8 Arise, O LORD, into thy resting-place; * thou, and the ark
      of thy strength.<BR>
      9 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; * and let thy
      saints sing with joyfulness.<BR>
      10 For thy servant David's sake, * turn not away the face of
      thine anointed.<BR>
      11 The LORD hath made a faithful oath unto David, * and he shall
      not shrink from it:<BR>
      12 Of the fruit of thy body * shall I set upon thy throne.<BR>
      13 If thy children will keep my covenant, and my testimonies
      that I shall teach them; * their children also shall sit upon
      thy throne for evermore.<BR>
      14 For the LORD hath chosen Sion to be an habitation for himself;
      * he hath longed for her.<BR>
      15 This shall be my rest for ever: * here will I dwell, for I
      have a delight therein.<BR>
      16 I will bless her victuals with increase, * and will satisfy
      her poor with bread.<BR>
      17 I will deck her priests with health, * and her saints shall
      rejoice and sing.<BR>
      18 There shall I make the horn of David to flourish: * I have
      ordained a lantern for mine anointed.<BR>
      19 As for his enemies, I shall clothe them with shame; * but
      upon himself shall his crown flourish.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 133. Ecce, quam bonum!</B><BR>
      BEHOLD, how good and joyful a thing it is, * for brethren to
      dwell together in unity!<BR>
      2 It is like the precious oil upon the head, that ran down unto
      the beard, * even unto Aaron's beard, and went down to the skirts
      of his clothing.<BR>
      3 Like as the dew of Hermon, * which fell upon the hill of Sion.<BR>
      4 For there the LORD promised his blessing, * and life for evermore.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 134. Ecce nunc.</B><BR>
      BEHOLD now, praise the LORD, * all ye servants of the LORD;<BR>
      2 Ye that by night stand in the house of the LORD, * even in
      the courts of the house of our God.<BR>
      3 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, * and praise the LORD.<BR>
      4 The LORD that made heaven and earth * give thee blessing out
      of Sion.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 135. Laudate Nomen.</B><BR>
      O PRAISE the LORD, laud ye the Name of the LORD; * praise it,
      O ye servants of the LORD;<BR>
      2 Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, * in the courts of
      the house of our God.<BR>
      3 O praise the LORD, for the LORD is gracious; * O sing praises
      unto his Name, for it is lovely.<BR>
      4 For why? the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, * and Israel
      for his own possession.<BR>
      5 For I know that the LORD is great, * and that our Lord is above
      all gods.<BR>
      6 Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in
      earth; * and in the sea, and in all deep places.<BR>
      7 He bringeth forth the clouds from the ends of the world, *
      and sendeth forth lightnings with the rain, bringing the winds
      out of his treasuries.<BR>
      8 He smote the firstborn of Egypt, * both of man and beast.<BR>
      9 He hath sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O thou
      land of Egypt; * upon Pharaoh, and all his servants.<BR>
      10 He smote divers nations, * and slew mighty kings:<BR>
      11 Sihon, king of the Amorites; and Og, the king of Bashan; *
      and all the kingdoms of Canaan;<BR>
      12 And gave their land to be an heritage, * even an heritage
      unto Israel his people.<BR>
      13 Thy Name, O LORD, endureth for ever; * so doth thy memorial,
      O LORD, from one generation to another.<BR>
      14 For the LORD will avenge his people, * and be gracious unto
      his servants.<BR>
      15 As for the images of the heathen, they are but silver and
      gold; * the work of men's hands.<BR>
      16 They have mouths, and speak not; * eyes have they, but they
      see not.<BR>
      17 They have ears, and yet they hear not; * neither is there
      any breath in their mouths.<BR>
      18 They that make them are like unto them; * and so are all they
      that put their trust in them.<BR>
      19 Praise the LORD, ye house of Israel; * praise the LORD, ye
      house of Aaron.<BR>
      20 Praise the LORD, ye house of Levi; * ye that fear the LORD,
      praise the LORD.<BR>
      21 Praised be the LORD out of Sion, * who dwelleth at Jerusalem.<BR>

      20 And Og, the king of Bashan: * for his mercy endureth for ever;<BR>
      21 And gave away their land for an heritage: * for his mercy
      endureth for ever;<BR>
      22 Even for an heritage unto Israel his servant: * for his mercy
      endureth for ever.<BR>
      23 Who remembered us when we were in trouble: * for his mercy
      endureth for ever;<BR>
      24 And hath delivered us from our enemies: * for his mercy endureth
      for ever.<BR>
      25 Who giveth food to all flesh: * for his mercy endureth for
      ever.<BR>

      for ever.<BR>

      <B><BR>
      Psalm 137. Super flumina.</B><BR>
      BY the waters of Babylon we sat down and wept, * when we remembered
      thee, O Sion.<BR>
      2 As for our harps, we hanged them up * upon the trees that are
      therein.<BR>
      3 For they that led us away captive, required of us then a song,
      and melody in our heaviness: * Sing us one of the songs of Sion.<BR>
      4 How shall we sing the LORD'S song * in a strange land?<BR>
      5 If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, * let my right hand forget her
      cunning.<BR>
      6 If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof
      of my mouth; * yea, if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief
      joy.<BR>
      7 Remember the children of Edom, O LORD, in the day of Jerusalem;
      * how they said, Down with it, down with it, even to the ground.<BR>
      8 O daughter of Babylon, wasted with misery; * yea, happy shall
      he be that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.<BR>
      9 Blessed shall he be that taketh thy children, * and throweth
      them against the stones.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 138. Confitebor tibi.</B><BR>
      I WILL give thanks unto thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; *
      even before the gods will I sing praise unto thee.<BR>
      2 I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy Name,
      because of thy loving-kindness and truth; * for thou hast magnified
      thy Name, and thy word, above all things.<BR>
      3 When I called upon thee, thou heardest me; * and enduedst my
      soul with much strength.<BR>
      4 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD; * for
      they have heard the words of thy mouth.<BR>
      5 Yea, they shall sing of the ways of the LORD, * that great
      is the glory of the LORD.<BR>
      6 For though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly;
      * as for the proud, he beholdeth them afar off.<BR>
      7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, yet shalt thou refresh
      me; * thou shalt stretch forth thy hand upon the furiousness
      of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.<BR>
      8 The LORD shall make good his loving-kindness toward me; * yea,
      thy mercy, O LORD, endureth for ever; despise not then the works
      of thine own hands.</P>
