      <P><B>Psalm 118. Confitemini Domino.</B><BR>
      O GIVE thanks unto the LORD, for he is gracious; * because his
      mercy endureth for ever.<BR>
      2 Let Israel now confess that he is gracious, * and that his
      mercy endureth for ever.<BR>
      3 Let the house of Aaron now confess, * that his mercy endureth
      for ever.<BR>
      4 Yea, let them now that fear the LORD confess, * that his mercy
      endureth for ever.<BR>
      5 I called upon the LORD in trouble; * and the LORD heard me
      at large.<BR>
      6 The LORD is on my side; * I will not fear what man doeth unto
      me.<BR>
      7 The LORD taketh my part with them that help me; * therefore
      shall I see my desire upon mine enemies.<BR>
      8 It is better to trust in the LORD, * than to put any confidence
      in man.<BR>
      9 It is better to trust in the LORD, * than to put any confidence
      in princes.<BR>
      10 All nations compassed me round about; * but in the Name of
      the LORD will I destroy them.<BR>
      11 They kept me in on every side, they kept me in, I say, on
      every side; * but in the Name of the LORD will I destroy them.<BR>
      12 They came about me like bees, and are extinct even as the
      fire among the thorns; * for in the Name of the LORD I will destroy
      them.<BR>
      13 Thou hast thrust sore at me, that I might fall; * but the
      LORD was my help.<BR>
      14 The LORD is my strength, and my song; * and is become my salvation.<BR>
      15 The voice of joy and health is in the dwellings of the righteous;
      * the right hand of the LORD bringeth mighty things to pass.<BR>
      16 The right hand of the LORD hath the pre-eminence; * the right
      hand of the LORD bringeth mighty things to pass.<BR>
      17 I shall not die, but live, * and declare the works of the
      LORD.<BR>
      18 The LORD hath chastened and corrected me; * but he hath not
      given me over unto death.<BR>
      19 Open me the gates of righteousness, * that I may go into them,
      and give thanks unto the LORD.<BR>
      20 This is the gate of the LORD, * the righteous shall enter
      into it.<BR>
      21 I will thank thee; for thou hast heard me, * and art become
      my salvation.<BR>
      22 The same stone which the builders refused, * is become the
      head-stone in the comer.<BR>
      23 This is the LORD'S doing, * and it is marvellous in our eyes.<BR>
      24 This is the day which the LORD hath made; * we will rejoice
      and be glad in it.<BR>
      25 Help me now, O LORD: * O LORD, send us now prosperity.<BR>
      26 Blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the LORD: * we have
      wished you good luck, we that are of the house of the LORD.<BR>
      27 God is the LORD, who hath showed us light: * bind the sacrifice
      with cords, yea, even unto the horns of the altar.<BR>
      28 Thou art my God, and I will thank thee; * thou art my God,
      and I will praise thee.<BR>
      29 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is gracious, * and his
      mercy endureth for ever.
