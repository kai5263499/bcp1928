    <p><strong>Psalm 110. Dixit Dominus.</strong><br />
      THE LORD said unto my Lord, * Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.<br />
      2 The LORD shall send the rod of thy power out of Sion: * be thou ruler, even in the midst among thine enemies.<br />
      3 In the day of thy power shall thy people offer themselves willingly with an holy worship: * thy young men come to thee as dew from the womb of the morning.<br />
      4 The LORD sware, and will not repent, * Thou art a Priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.<br />
      5 The Lord upon thy right hand * shall wound even kings in the day of his wrath.<br />
      6 He shall judge among the heathen; * he shall fill the places with the dead bodies, and smite in sunder the heads over divers countries.<br />
      7 He shall drink of the brook in the way; * therefore shall he lift up his head.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 111. Confitebor tibi.</strong><br />
      I WILL give thanks unto the LORD with my whole heart, * secretly among the faithful, and in the congregation.<br />
      2 The works of the LORD are great, * sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.<br />
      3 His work is worthy to be praised and had in honour, * and his righteousness endureth for ever.<br />
      4 The merciful and gracious LORD hath so done his marvellous works, * that they ought to be had in remembrance.<br />
      5 He hath given meat unto them that fear him; * he shall ever be mindful of his covenant.<br />
      6 He hath showed his people the power of his works, * that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.<br />
      7 The works of his hands are verity and judgment; * all his commandments are true.<br />
      8 They stand fast for ever and ever, * and are done in truth and equity.<br />
      9 He sent redemption unto his people; * he hath commanded his covenant for ever; holy and reverend is his Name.<br />
      10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; * a good understanding have all they that do thereafter; his praise endureth for ever.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 112. Beatus vir.</strong><br />
      BLESSED is the man that feareth the LORD; * he hath great delight in his commandments.<br />
      2 His seed shall be mighty upon earth; * the generation of the faithful shall be blessed.<br />
      3 Riches and plenteousness shall be in his house; * and his righteousness endureth for ever.<br />
      4 Unto the godly there ariseth up light in the darkness; * he is merciful, loving, and righteous.<br />
      5 A good man is merciful, and lendeth; * and will guide his words with discretion.<br />
      6 For he shall never be moved: * and the righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance.<br />
      7 He will not be afraid of any evil tidings; * for his heart standeth fast, and believeth in the LORD.<br />
      8 His heart is stablished, and will not shrink, * until he see his desire upon his enemies.<br />
      9 He hath dispersed abroad, and given to the poor. * and his righteousness remaineth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.<br />
      10 The ungodly shall see it, and it shall grieve him; * he shall gnash with his teeth, and consume away; the desire of the ungodly shall perish.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 113. Laudate, pueri.</strong><br />
      PRAISE the LORD, ye servants; * O praise the Name of the LORD.<br />
      2 Blessed be the Name of the LORD * from this time forth for evermore.<br />
      3 The LORD'S Name is praised * from the rising up of the sun unto the going down of the same.<br />
      4 The LORD is high above all nations, * and his glory above the heavens.<br />
      5 Who is like unto the LORD our God, that hath his dwelling so high, * and yet humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven and earth!<br />
      6 He taketh up the simple out of the dust, * and lifteth the poor out of the mire;<br />
      7 That he may set him with the princes, * even with the princes of his people.<br />
    8 He maketh the barren woman to keep house, * and to be a joyful mother of children.
