    <p><strong>Psalm 62. Nonne Deo?</strong><br />
      MY soul truly waiteth still upon God; * for of him cometh my salvation.<br />
      2 He verily is my strength and my salvation; * he is my defence, so that I shall not greatly fall.<br />
      3 How long will ye imagine mischief against every man? * Ye shall be slain all the sort of you; yea, as a tottering wall shall ye be, and like a broken hedge.<br />
      4 Their device is only how to put him out whom God will exalt; * their delight is in lies; they give good words with their mouth, but curse with their heart.<br />
      5 Nevertheless, my soul, wait thou still upon God; * for my hope is in him.<br />
      6 He truly is my strength and my salvation; * he is my defence, so that I shall not fall.<br />
      7 In God is my health and my glory; * the rock of my might; and in God is my trust.<br />
      8 O put your trust in him alway, ye people; * pour out your hearts before him, for God is our hope.<br />
      9 As for the children of men, they are but vanity; the children of men are deceitful; * upon the weights they are altogether lighter than vanity itself.<br />
      10 O trust not in wrong and robbery; give not yourselves unto vanity: * if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.<br />
      11 God spake once, and twice I have also heard the same, * that power belongeth unto God;<br />
      12 And that thou, Lord, art merciful; * for thou rewardest every man according to his work.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 63. Deus, Deus meus.</strong><br />
      O GOD, thou art my God; * early will I seek thee.<br />
      2 My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh also longeth after thee, * in a barren and dry land where no water is.<br />
      3 Thus have I looked for thee in the sanctuary, * that I might behold thy power and glory.<br />
      4 For thy loving-kindness is better than the life itself: * my lips shall praise thee.<br />
      5 As long as I live will I magnify thee in this manner, * and lift up my hands in thy Name.<br />
      6 My soul shall be satisfied, even as it were with marrow and fatness, * when my mouth praiseth thee with joyful lips.<br />
      7 Have I not remembered thee in my bed, * and thought upon thee when I was waking?<br />
      8 Because thou hast been my helper; * therefore under the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.<br />
      9 My soul hangeth upon thee; * thy right hand hath upholden me.<br />
      10 These also that seek the hurt of my soul, * they shall go under the earth.<br />
      11 Let them fall upon the edge of the sword, * that they may be a portion for foxes.<br />
      12 But the King shall rejoice in God; all they also that swear by him shall be commended; * for the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 64. Exaudi, Deus.</strong><br />
      HEAR my voice, O God, in my prayer; * preserve my life from fear of the enemy.<br />
      2 Hide me from the gathering together of the froward, * and from the insurrection of wicked doers;<br />
      3 Who have whet their tongue like a sword, * and shoot out their arrows, even bitter words;<br />
      4 That they may privily shoot at him that is perfect: * suddenly do they hit him, and fear not.<br />
      5 They encourage themselves in mischief, * and commune among themselves, how they may lay snares; and say, that no man shall see them.<br />
      6 They imagine wickedness, and practise it; * that they keep secret among themselves, every man in the deep of his heart.<br />
      7 But God shall suddenly shoot at them with a swift arrow, * that they shall be wounded.<br />
      8 Yea, their own tongues shall make them fall; * insomuch that whoso seeth them shall laugh them to scorn.<br />
      9 And all men that see it shall say, This hath God done; * for they shall perceive that it is his work.<br />
    10 The righteous shall rejoice in the LORD, and put his trust in him; * and all they that are true of heart shall be glad.
