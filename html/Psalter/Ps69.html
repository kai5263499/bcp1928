      <P><B>Psalm 69. Salvum me fac.</B><BR>
      SAVE me, O God; * for the waters are come in, even unto my soul.<BR>
      2 I stick fast in the deep mire, where no ground is; * I am come
      into deep waters, so that the floods run over me.<BR>
      3 I am weary of crying; my throat is dry; * my sight faileth
      me for waiting so long upon my God.<BR>
      4 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of
      my head; * they that are mine enemies, and would destroy me guiltless,
      are mighty.<BR>
      5 I paid them the things that I never took: * God, thou knowest
      my simpleness, and my faults are not hid from thee.<BR>
      6 Let not them that trust in thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed
      for my cause; * let not those that seek thee be confounded through
      me, O Lord God of Israel.<BR>
      7 And why? for thy sake have I suffered reproof; * shame hath
      covered my face.<BR>
      8 I am become a stranger unto my brethren, * even an alien unto
      my mother's children.<BR>
      9 For the zeal of thine house hath even eaten me; * and the rebukes
      of them that rebuked thee are fallen upon me.<BR>
      10 I wept, and chastened myself with fasting, * and that was
      turned to my reproof.<BR>
      11 I put on sackcloth also, * and they jested upon me.<BR>
      12 They that sit in the gate speak against me, * and the drunkards
      make songs upon me.<BR>
      13 But, LORD, I make my prayer unto thee * in an acceptable time.<BR>
      14 Hear me, O God, in the multitude of thy mercy, * even in the
      truth of thy salvation.<BR>
      15 Take me out of the mire, that I sink not; * O let me be delivered
      from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.<BR>
      16 Let not the water-flood drown me, neither let the deep swallow
      me up; * and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.<BR>
      17 Hear me, O LORD, for thy loving-kindness is comfortable; *
      turn thee unto me according to the multitude of thy mercies.<BR>
      18 And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble:
      * O haste thee, and hear me.<BR>
      19 Draw nigh unto my soul, and save it; * O deliver me, because
      of mine enemies.<BR>
      20 Thou hast known my reproach, my shame, and my dishonour: *
      mine adversaries are all in thy sight.<BR>
      21 Reproach hath broken my heart; I am full of heaviness: * I
      looked for some to have pity on me, but there was no man, neither
      found I any to comfort me.<BR>
      22 They gave me gall to eat; * and when I was thirsty they gave
      me vinegar to drink.<BR>
      23 Let their table be made a snare to take themselves withal;
      * and let the things that should have been for their wealth be
      unto them an occasion of falling.<BR>
      24 Let their eyes be blinded, that they see not; * and ever bow
      thou down their backs.<BR>
      25 Pour out thine indignation upon them, * and let thy wrathful
      displeasure take hold of them.<BR>
      26 Let their habitation be void, * and no man to dwell in their
      tents.<BR>
      27 For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; * and they
      talk how they may vex them whom thou hast wounded.<BR>
      28 Let them fall from one wickedness to another, * and not come
      into thy righteousness.<BR>
      29 Let them be wiped out of the book of the living, * and not
      be written among the righteous.<BR>
      30 As for me, when I am poor and in heaviness, * thy help, O
      God, shall lift me up.<BR>
      31 I will praise the Name of God with a song, * and magnify it
      with thanksgiving.<BR>
      32 This also shall please the LORD * better than a bullock that
      hath horns and hoofs.<BR>
      33 The humble shall consider this, and be glad: * seek ye after
      God, and your soul shall live.<BR>
      34 For the LORD heareth the poor, * and despiseth not his prisoners.<BR>
      35 Let heaven and earth praise him: * the sea, and all that moveth
      therein.<BR>
      36 For God will save Sion, and build the cities of Judah, * that
      men may dwell there, and have it in possession.<BR>
      37 The posterity also of his servants shall inherit it; * and
      they that love his Name shall dwell therein.
