      <P><B>Psalm 64. Exaudi, Deus.</B><BR>
      HEAR my voice, O God, in my prayer; * preserve my life from fear
      of the enemy.<BR>
      2 Hide me from the gathering together of the froward, * and from
      the insurrection of wicked doers;<BR>
      3 Who have whet their tongue like a sword, * and shoot out their
      arrows, even bitter words;<BR>
      4 That they may privily shoot at him that is perfect: * suddenly
      do they hit him, and fear not.<BR>
      5 They encourage themselves in mischief, * and commune among
      themselves, how they may lay snares; and say, that no man shall
      see them.<BR>
      6 They imagine wickedness, and practise it; * that they keep
      secret among themselves, every man in the deep of his heart.<BR>
      7 But God shall suddenly shoot at them with a swift arrow, *
      that they shall be wounded.<BR>
      8 Yea, their own tongues shall make them fall; * insomuch that
      whoso seeth them shall laugh them to scorn.<BR>
      9 And all men that see it shall say, This hath God done; * for
      they shall perceive that it is his work.<BR>
      10 The righteous shall rejoice in the LORD, and put his trust
      in him; * and all they that are true of heart shall be glad.
