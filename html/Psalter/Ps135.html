      <P><B>Psalm 135. Laudate Nomen.</B><BR>
      O PRAISE the LORD, laud ye the Name of the LORD; * praise it,
      O ye servants of the LORD;<BR>
      2 Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, * in the courts of
      the house of our God.<BR>
      3 O praise the LORD, for the LORD is gracious; * O sing praises
      unto his Name, for it is lovely.<BR>
      4 For why? the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, * and Israel
      for his own possession.<BR>
      5 For I know that the LORD is great, * and that our Lord is above
      all gods.<BR>
      6 Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in
      earth; * and in the sea, and in all deep places.<BR>
      7 He bringeth forth the clouds from the ends of the world, *
      and sendeth forth lightnings with the rain, bringing the winds
      out of his treasuries.<BR>
      8 He smote the firstborn of Egypt, * both of man and beast.<BR>
      9 He hath sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O thou
      land of Egypt; * upon Pharaoh, and all his servants.<BR>
      10 He smote divers nations, * and slew mighty kings:<BR>
      11 Sihon, king of the Amorites; and Og, the king of Bashan; *
      and all the kingdoms of Canaan;<BR>
      12 And gave their land to be an heritage, * even an heritage
      unto Israel his people.<BR>
      13 Thy Name, O LORD, endureth for ever; * so doth thy memorial,
      O LORD, from one generation to another.<BR>
      14 For the LORD will avenge his people, * and be gracious unto
      his servants.<BR>
      15 As for the images of the heathen, they are but silver and
      gold; * the work of men's hands.<BR>
      16 They have mouths, and speak not; * eyes have they, but they
      see not.<BR>
      17 They have ears, and yet they hear not; * neither is there
      any breath in their mouths.<BR>
      18 They that make them are like unto them; * and so are all they
      that put their trust in them.<BR>
      19 Praise the LORD, ye house of Israel; * praise the LORD, ye
      house of Aaron.<BR>
      20 Praise the LORD, ye house of Levi; * ye that fear the LORD,
      praise the LORD.<BR>
      21 Praised be the LORD out of Sion, * who dwelleth at Jerusalem.
