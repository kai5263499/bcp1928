      <P><B>Psalm 149. Cantate Domino.</B><BR>
      O SING unto the LORD a new song; * let the congregation of saints
      praise him.<BR>
      2 Let Israel rejoice in him that made him, * and let the children
      of Sion be joyful in their King.<BR>
      3 Let them praise his Name in the dance: * let them sing praises
      unto him with tabret and harp.<BR>
      4 For the LORD hath pleasure in his people, * and helpeth the
      meek-hearted.<BR>
      5 Let the saints be joyful with glory; * let them rejoice in
      their beds.<BR>
      6 Let the praises of God be in their mouth; * and a two-edged
      sword in their hands;<BR>
      7 To be avenged of the nations, * and to rebuke the peoples;<BR>
      8 To bind their kings in chains, * and their nobles with links
      of iron;<BR>
      9 To execute judgment upon them; as it is written, * Such honour
      have all his saints.
