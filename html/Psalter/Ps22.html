      <P><B>Psalms 22. Deus, Deus meus.</B><BR>
      MY God, my God, look upon me; why hast thou forsaken me? * and
      art so far from my health, and from the words of my complaint?<BR>
      2 O my God, I cry in the day-time, but thou hearest not; * and
      in the night season also I take no rest.<BR>
      3 And thou continuest holy, * O thou Worship of Israel.<BR>
      4 Our fathers hoped in thee; * they trusted in thee, and thou
      didst deliver them.<BR>
      5 They called upon thee, and were holpen; * they put their trust
      in thee, and were not confounded.<BR>
      6 But as for me, I am a worm, and no man; * a very scorn of men,
      and the outcast of the people.<BR>
      7 All they that see me laugh me to scorn; * they shoot out their
      lips, and shake their heads, saying,<BR>
      8 He trusted in the LORD, that he would deliver him; * let him
      deliver him, if he will have him.<BR>
      9 But thou art he that took me out of my mother's womb; * thou
      wast my hope, when I hanged yet upon my mother's breasts.<BR>
      10 I have been left unto thee ever since I was born; * thou art
      my God even from my mother's womb.<BR>
      11 O go not from me; for trouble is hard at hand, * and there
      is none to help me.<BR>
      12 Many oxen are come about me; * fat bulls of Bashan close me
      in on every side.<BR>
      13 They gape upon me with their mouths, * as it were a ramping
      and a roaring lion.<BR>
      14 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint;
      * my heart also in the midst of my body is even like melting
      wax.<BR>
      15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my<BR>
      tongue cleaveth to my gums, * and thou bringest me into the dust
      of death.<BR>
      16 For many dogs are come about me, * and the council of the
      wicked layeth siege against me.<BR>
      17 They pierced my hands and my feet: I may tell all my bones:
      * they stand staring and looking upon me.<BR>
      18 They part my garments among them, * and cast lots upon my
      vesture.<BR>
      19 But be not thou far from me, O LORD; * thou art my succour,
      haste thee to help me.<BR>
      20 Deliver my soul from the sword, * my darling from the power
      of the dog.<BR>
      21 Save me from the lion's mouth; * thou hast heard me also from
      among the horns of the unicorns.<BR>
      22 I will declare thy Name unto my brethren; * in the midst of
      the congregation will I praise thee.<BR>
      <A NAME="anchor2074398"></A>23 O praise the LORD, ye that fear
      him: * magnify him, all ye of the seed of Jacob; and fear him,
      all ye seed of Israel.<BR>
      24 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the low estate of the
      poor; * he hath not hid his face from him; but when he called
      unto him he heard him.<BR>
      25 My praise is of thee in the great-congregation; * my vows
      will I perform in the sight of them that fear him.<BR>
      26 The poor shall eat, and be satisfied; they that seek after
      the LORD shall praise him: * your heart shall live for ever.<BR>
      27 All the ends of the world shall remember themselves, and be
      turned unto the LORD; * and all the kindreds of the nations shall
      worship before him.<BR>
      28 For the kingdom is the LORD'S, * and he is the Governor among
      the nations.<BR>
      29 All such as be fat upon earth * have eaten, and worshipped.<BR>
      30 All they that go down into the dust shall kneel before him;
      * and no man hath quickened his own soul.<BR>
      31 My seed shall serve him: * they shall be counted unto the
      Lord for a generation.<BR>
      32 They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness * unto
      a people that shall be born, whom the Lord hath made.
