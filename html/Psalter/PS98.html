      <P><B>Psalm 98. Cantate Domino</B>.<BR>
      O SING unto the LORD a new song; * for he hath done marvellous
      things.<BR>
      2 With his own right hand, and with his holy arm, * hath he gotten
      himself the victory.<BR>
      3 The LORD declared his salvation; * his righteousness hath he
      openly showed in the sight of the heathen.<BR>
      4 He hath remembered his mercy and truth toward the house of
      Israel; * and all the ends of the world have seen the salvation
      of our God.<BR>
      5 Show yourselves joyful unto the LORD, all ye lands; * sing,
      rejoice, and give thanks.<BR>
      6 Praise the LORD upon the harp; * sing to the harp with a psalm
      of thanksgiving.<BR>
      7 With trumpets also and shawms, * O show yourselves joyful before
      the LORD, the King.<BR>
      8 Let the sea make a noise, and all that therein is; * the round
      world, and they that dwell therein.<BR>
      9 Let the floods clap their hands, and let the hills be joyful
      together before the LORD; * for he is come to judge the earth.<BR>
      10 With righteousness shall he judge the world, * and the peoples
      with equity.
