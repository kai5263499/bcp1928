    <p><strong>Psalm 116. Dilexi, quoniam.</strong><br />
      MY delight is in the LORD; * because he hath heard the voice of my prayer;<br />
      2 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me; * therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.<br />
      3 The snares of death compassed me round about, * and the pains of hell gat hold upon me.<br />
      4 I found trouble and heaviness; then called I upon the Name of the LORD; * O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.<br />
      5 Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; * yea, our God is merciful.<br />
      6 The LORD preserveth the simple: * I was in misery, and he helped me.<br />
      7 Turn again then unto thy rest, O my soul; * for the LORD hath rewarded thee.<br />
      8 And why? thou hast delivered my soul from death, * mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.<br />
      9 I will walk before the LORD * in the land of the living.<br />
      10 I believed, and therefore will I speak; but I was sore troubled: * I said in my haste, All men are liars.<br />
      11 What reward shall I give unto the LORD * for all the benefits that he hath done unto me?<br />
      12 I will receive the cup of salvation, * and call upon the Name of the LORD.<br />
      13 I will pay my vows now in the presence of all his people: * right dear in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.<br />
      14 Behold, O LORD, how that I am thy servant; * I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid; thou hast broken my bonds in sunder.<br />
      15 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, * and will call upon the Name of the LORD.<br />
      16 I will pay my vows unto the LORD, in the sight of all his people, * in the courts of the LORD'S house; even in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise the LORD.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 117. Laudate Dominum.</strong><br />
      O PRAISE the LORD, all ye nations; * praise him, all ye peoples.<br />
      2 For his merciful kindness is ever more and more toward us; * and the truth of the LORD endureth for ever. Praise the LORD.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 118. Confitemini Domino.</strong><br />
      O GIVE thanks unto the LORD, for he is gracious; * because his mercy endureth for ever.<br />
      2 Let Israel now confess that he is gracious, * and that his mercy endureth for ever.<br />
      3 Let the house of Aaron now confess, * that his mercy endureth for ever.<br />
      4 Yea, let them now that fear the LORD confess, * that his mercy endureth for ever.<br />
      5 I called upon the LORD in trouble; * and the LORD heard me at large.<br />
      6 The LORD is on my side; * I will not fear what man doeth unto me.<br />
      7 The LORD taketh my part with them that help me; * therefore shall I see my desire upon mine enemies.<br />
      8 It is better to trust in the LORD, * than to put any confidence in man.<br />
      9 It is better to trust in the LORD, * than to put any confidence in princes.<br />
      10 All nations compassed me round about; * but in the Name of the LORD will I destroy them.<br />
      11 They kept me in on every side, they kept me in, I say, on every side; * but in the Name of the LORD will I destroy them.<br />
      12 They came about me like bees, and are extinct even as the fire among the thorns; * for in the Name of the LORD I will destroy them.<br />
      13 Thou hast thrust sore at me, that I might fall; * but the LORD was my help.<br />
      14 The LORD is my strength, and my song; * and is become my salvation.<br />
      15 The voice of joy and health is in the dwellings of the righteous; * the right hand of the LORD bringeth mighty things to pass.<br />
      16 The right hand of the LORD hath the pre-eminence; * the right hand of the LORD bringeth mighty things to pass.<br />
      17 I shall not die, but live, * and declare the works of the LORD.<br />
      18 The LORD hath chastened and corrected me; * but he hath not given me over unto death.<br />
      19 Open me the gates of righteousness, * that I may go into them, and give thanks unto the LORD.<br />
      20 This is the gate of the LORD, * the righteous shall enter into it.<br />
      21 I will thank thee; for thou hast heard me, * and art become my salvation.<br />
      22 The same stone which the builders refused, * is become the head-stone in the corner.<br />
      23 This is the LORD'S doing, * and it is marvellous in our eyes.<br />
      24 This is the day which the LORD hath made; * we will rejoice and be glad in it.<br />
      25 Help me now, O LORD: * O LORD, send us now prosperity.<br />
      26 Blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the LORD: * we have wished you good luck, we that are of the house of the LORD.<br />
      27 God is the LORD, who hath showed us light: * bind the sacrifice with cords, yea, even unto the horns of the altar.<br />
      28 Thou art my God, and I will thank thee; * thou art my God, and I will praise thee.<br />
    29 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is gracious, * and his mercy endureth for ever.
