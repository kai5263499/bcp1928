      <P><B>Psalms 49. Audite haec, omnes.</B><BR>
      O HEAR ye this, all ye people; * ponder it with your ears, all
      ye that dwell in the world;<BR>
      2 High and low, rich and poor, * one with another.<BR>
      3 My mouth shall speak of wisdom, * and my heart shall muse of
      understanding.<BR>
      4 I will incline mine ear to the parable, * and show my dark
      speech upon the harp.<BR>
      5 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, * when wickedness
      at my heels compasseth me round about?<BR>
      6 There be some that put their trust in their goods, * and boast
      themselves in the multitude of their riches.<BR>
      7 But no man may deliver his brother, * nor give a ransom unto
      God for him,<BR>
      8 (For it cost more to redeem their souls, * so that he must
      let that alone for ever;)<BR>
      9 That he shall live alway, * and not see the grave.<BR>
      10 For he seeth that wise men also die and perish together, *
      as well as the ignorant and foolish, and leave their riches for
      other.<BR>
      11 And yet they think that their houses shall continue for ever,
      and that their dwelling-places shall endure from one generation
      to another; * and call the lands after their own names.<BR>
      12 Nevertheless, man being in honour abideth not, * seeing he
      may be compared unto the beasts that perish;<BR>
      13 This their way is very foolishness; * yet their posterity
      praise their saying.<BR>
      14 They lie in the grave like sheep; death is their shepherd;
      and the righteous shall have dominion over them in the morning:
      * their beauty shall consume in the sepulchre, and have no abiding.<BR>
      15 But God hath delivered my soul from the power of the grave;
      * for he shall receive me.<BR>
      16 Be not thou afraid, though one be made rich, * or if the glory
      of his house be increased;<BR>
      17 For he shall carry nothing away with him when he dieth, *
      neither shall his pomp follow him.<BR>
      18 For while he lived, he counted himself an happy man; * and
      so long as thou doest well unto thyself, men will speak good
      of thee.<BR>
      19 He shall follow the generation of his fathers, * and shall
      never see light.<BR>
      20 Man that is in honour but hath no understanding * is compared
      unto the beasts that perish.
