      <P><B>Psalm 96. Cantate Domino.</B><BR>
      O SING unto the LORD a new song; * sing unto the LORD, all the
      whole earth.<BR>
      2 Sing unto the LORD, and praise his Name; * be telling of his
      salvation from day to day.<BR>
      3 Declare his honour unto the heathen, * and his wonders unto
      all peoples.<BR>
      4 For the LORD is great, and cannot worthily be praised;* he
      is more to be feared than all gods.<BR>
      5 As for all the gods of the heathen, they are but idols; * but
      it is the LORD that made the heavens.<BR>
      6 Glory and worship are before him; * power and honour are in
      his sanctuary.<BR>
      7 Ascribe unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the peoples, * ascribe
      unto the LORD worship and power.<BR>
      8 Ascribe unto the LORD the honour due unto his Name; * bring
      presents, and come into his courts.<BR>
      9 O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness; * let the whole
      earth stand in awe of him.<BR>
      10 Tell it out among the heathen, that the LORD is King, and
      that it is he who hath made the round world so fast that it cannot
      be moved; * and how that he shall judge the peoples righteously.<BR>
      11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; * let
      the sea make a noise, and all that therein is.<BR>
      12 Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it; * then shall
      all the trees of the wood rejoice before the LORD.<BR>
      13 For he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth; * and with
      righteousness to judge the world, and the peoples with his truth.
