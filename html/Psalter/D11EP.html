    <p><strong>Psalm 59. Eripe me de inimicis.</strong><br />
      DELIVER me from mine enemies, O God; * defend me from them that rise up against me.<br />
      2 O deliver me from the wicked doers, * and save me from the blood-thirsty men.<br />
      3 For lo, they lie waiting for my soul; * the mighty men are gathered against me, without any offence or fault of me, O LORD.<br />
      4 They run and prepare themselves without my fault; * arise thou therefore to help me, and behold.<br />
      5 Stand up, O LORD God of hosts, thou God of Israel, to visit all the heathen, * and be not merciful unto them that offend of malicious wickedness.<br />
      6 They go to and fro in the evening, * they grin like a dog, and run about through the city.<br />
      7 Behold, they speak with their mouth, and swords are in their lips; * for who doth hear?<br />
      8 But thou, O LORD, shalt have them in derision, * and thou shalt laugh all the heathen to scorn.<br />
      9 My strength will I ascribe unto thee; * for thou art the God of my refuge.<br />
      10 God showeth me his goodness plenteously; * and God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies.<br />
      11 Slay them not, lest my people forget it; * but scatter them abroad among the people, and put them down, O Lord our defence.<br />
      12 For the sin of their mouth, and for the words of their lips, they shall be taken in their pride: * and why? their talk is of cursing and lies.<br />
      13 Consume them in thy wrath, consume them, that they may perish; * and know that it is God that ruleth in Jacob, and unto the ends of the world.<br />
      14 And in the evening they will return, * grin like a dog, and will go about the city.<br />
      15 They will run here and there for meat, * and grudge if they be not satisfied.<br />
      16 As for me, I will sing of thy power, and will praise thy mercy betimes in the morning; * for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble.<br />
      17 Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing; * for thou, O God, art my refuge, and my merciful God.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 60. Deus, repulisti nos.</strong><br />
      O GOD, thou hast cast us out, and scattered us abroad; * thou hast also been displeased: O turn thee unto us again.<br />
      2 Thou hast moved the land, and divided it: * heal the sores thereof, for it shaketh.<br />
      3 Thou hast showed thy people heavy things; * thou hast given us a drink of deadly wine.<br />
      4 Thou hast given a token for such as fear thee, * that they may triumph because of the truth.<br />
      5 Therefore were thy beloved delivered; * help me with thy right hand, and hear me.<br />
      6 God hath spoken in his holiness, I will rejoice, and divide Shechem, * and mete out the valley of Succoth.<br />
      7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; * Ephraim also is the strength of my head; Judah is my law-giver;<br />
      8 Moab is my wash-pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; * Philistia, be thou glad of me.<br />
      9 Who will lead me into the strong city? * who will bring me into Edom?<br />
      10 Hast not thou cast us out, O God? * wilt not thou, O God, go out with our hosts?<br />
      11 O be thou our help in trouble; * for vain is the help of man.<br />
      12 Through God will we do great acts; * for it is he that shall tread down our enemies.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 61. Exaudi, Deus.</strong><br />
      HEAR my crying, O God, * give ear unto my prayer.<br />
      2 From the ends of the earth will I call upon thee, * when my heart is in heaviness.<br />
      3 O set me up upon the rock that is higher than I; * for thou hast been my hope, and a strong tower for me against the enemy.<br />
      4 I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever, * and my trust shall be under the covering of thy wings.<br />
      5 For thou, O Lord, hast heard my desires, * and hast given an heritage unto those that fear thy Name.<br />
      6 Thou shalt grant the King a long life, * that his years may endure throughout all generations.<br />
      7 He shall dwell before God for ever: * O prepare thy loving mercy and faithfulness, that they may preserve him.<br />
    8 So will I alway sing praise unto thy Name, * that I may daily perform my vows.
