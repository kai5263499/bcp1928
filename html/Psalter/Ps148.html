      <P><B>Psalm 148. Laudate Dominum.</B><BR>
      O PRAISE the LORD from the heavens: * praise him in the heights.<BR>
      2 Praise him, all ye angels of his: * praise him, all his host.<BR>
      3 Praise him, sun and moon: * praise him, all ye stars and light.<BR>
      4 Praise him, all ye heavens, * and ye waters that are above
      the heavens.<BR>
      5 Let them praise the Name of the LORD: * for he spake the word,
      and they were made; he commanded, and they were created.<BR>
      6 He hath made them fast for ever and ever: * he hath given them
      a law which shall not be broken.<BR>
      7 Praise the LORD from the earth, * ye dragons and all deeps;<BR>
      8 Fire and hail, snow and vapours, * wind and storm, fulfilling
      his word;<BR>
      9 Mountains and all hills; * fruitful trees and all cedars;<BR>
      10 Beasts and all cattle; * creeping things and flying fowls;<BR>
      11 Kings of the earth, and all peoples; * princes, and all judges
      of the world;<BR>
      12 Young men and maidens, old men and children, praise the Name
      of the LORD: * for his Name only is excellent, and his praise
      above heaven and earth.<BR>
      13 He shall exalt the horn of his people: all his saints shall
      praise him; * even the children of Israel, even the people that
      serveth him.
