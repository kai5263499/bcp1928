      <P><B>Psalms 17. Exaudi, Domine.</B><BR>
      HEAR the right, O LORD, consider my complaint, * and hearken
      unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.<BR>
      2 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; * and let thine
      eyes look upon the thing that is equal.<BR>
      3 Thou hast proved and visited mine heart in the night season;
      thou hast tried me, and shalt find no wickedness in me; * for
      I am utterly purposed that my mouth shall not offend.<BR>
      4 As for the works of men, * by the word of thy lips I have kept
      me from the ways of the destroyer.<BR>
      5 O hold thou up my goings in thy paths, * that my footsteps
      slip not.<BR>
      6 I have called upon thee, O God, for thou shalt hear me: * incline
      thine ear to me, and hearken unto my words.<BR>
      7 Show thy marvellous loving-kindness, thou that art the Saviour
      of them which put their trust in thee, * from such as resist
      thy right hand.<BR>
      8 Keep me as the apple of an eye; * hide me under the shadow
      of thy wings,<BR>
      9 From the ungodly, that trouble me; * mine enemies compass me
      round about, to take away my soul.<BR>
      10 They are inclosed in their own fat, * and their mouth speaketh
      proud things.<BR>
      11 They lie waiting in our way on every side, * watching to cast
      us down to the ground;<BR>
      12 Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, * and as it were
      a lion's whelp lurking in secret places.<BR>
      13 Up, LORD, disappoint him, and cast him down; * deliver my
      soul from the ungodly, by thine own sword;<BR>
      14 Yea, by thy hand, O LORD; from the men of the evil world;
      * which have their portion in this life, whose bellies thou fillest
      with thy hid treasure.<BR>
      15 They have children at their desire, * and leave the rest of
      their substance for their babes.<BR>
      16 But as for me, I shall behold thy presence in righteousness;
      * and when I awake up after thy likeness, I shall be satisfied.
