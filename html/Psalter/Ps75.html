      <P><B>Psalm 75. Confitebimur tibi.</B><BR>
      UNTO thee, O God, do we give thanks; * yea, unto thee do we give
      thanks.<BR>
      2 Thy Name also is so nigh; * and that do thy wondrous works
      declare.<BR>
      3 In the appointed time, saith God, * I shall judge according
      unto right.<BR>
      4 The earth is weak, and all the inhabiters thereof: * I bear
      up the pillars of it.<BR>
      5 I said unto the fools, Deal not so madly; * and to the ungodly,
      Set not up your horn.<BR>
      6 Set not up your horn on high, * and speak not with a stiff
      neck.<BR>
      7 For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west,
      * nor yet from the south.<BR>
      8 And why? God is the Judge; * he putteth down one, and setteth
      up another.<BR>
      9 For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is
      red; * it is full mixt, and he poureth out of the same.<BR>
      10 As for the dregs thereof, * all the ungodly of the earth shall
      drink them, and suck them out.<BR>
      11 But I will talk of the God of Jacob, * and praise him for
      ever.<BR>
      12 All the horns of the ungodly also will I break, * and the
      horns of the righteous shall be exalted
