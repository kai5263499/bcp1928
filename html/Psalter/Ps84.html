      <P><B>Psalm 84. Quam dilecta!</B><BR>
      O HOW amiable are thy dwellings, * thou LORD of hosts!<BR>
      2 My soul hath a desire and longing to enter into the courts
      of the LORD; * my heart and my flesh rejoice in the living God.<BR>
      3 Yea, the sparrow hath found her an house, and the swallow a
      nest, where she may lay her young; * even thy altars, O LORD
      of hosts, my King and my God.<BR>
      4 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house; * they will be alway
      praising thee.<BR>
      5 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; * in whose heart
      are thy ways.<BR>
      6 Who going through the vale of misery use it for a well; * and
      the pools are filled with water.<BR>
      7 They will go from strength to strength, * and unto the God
      of gods appeareth every one of them in Sion.<BR>
      8 O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; * hearken, O God of Jacob.<BR>
      9 Behold, O God our defender, * and look upon the face of thine
      anointed.<BR>
      10 For one day in thy courts * is better than a thousand.<BR>
      11 I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God, * than
      to dwell in the tents of ungodliness.<BR>
      12 For the LORD God is a light and defence; * the LORD will give
      grace and worship; and no good thing shall he withhold from them
      that live a godly life.<BR>
      13 O LORD God of hosts, * blessed is the man that putteth his
      trust in thee.
