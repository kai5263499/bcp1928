    <p><strong>Psalm 73. Quam bonus Israel!</strong><br />
      TRULY God is loving unto Israel: * even unto such as are of a clean heart.<br />
      2 Nevertheless, my feet were almost gone, * my treadings had well-nigh slipt.<br />
      3 And why? I was grieved at the wicked: * I do also see the ungodly in such prosperity.<br />
      4 For they are in no peril of death; * but are lusty and strong.<br />
      5 They come in no misfortune like other folk; * neither are they plagued like other men.<br />
      6 And this is the cause that they are so holden with pride, * and cruelty covereth them as a garment.<br />
      7 Their eyes swell with fatness, * and they do even what they lust.<br />
      8 They corrupt other, and speak of wicked blasphemy; * their talking is against the Most High.<br />
      9 For they stretch forth their mouth unto the heaven, * and their tongue goeth through the world.<br />
      10 Therefore fall the people unto them, * and thereout suck they no small advantage.<br />
      11 Tush, say they, how should God perceive it? * is there knowledge in the Most High?<br />
      12 Lo, these are the ungodly, * these prosper in the world, and these have riches in possession:<br />
      13 And I said, Then have I cleansed my heart in vain, * and washed my hands in innocency.<br />
      14 All the day long have I been punished, * and chastened every morning.<br />
      15 Yea, and I had almost said even as they; * but lo, then I should have condemned the generation of thy children.<br />
      16 Then thought I to understand this; * but it was too hard for me,<br />
      17 Until I went into the sanctuary of God: * then understood I the end of these men;<br />
      18 Namely, how thou dost set them in slippery places, * and castest them down, and destroyest them.<br />
      19 O how suddenly do they consume, * perish, and come to a fearful end!<br />
      20 Yea, even like as a dream when one awaketh; * so shalt thou make their image to vanish out of the city.<br />
      21 Thus my heart was grieved, * and it went even through my reins.<br />
      22 So foolish was I, and ignorant, * even as it were a beast before thee.<br />
      23 Nevertheless, I am alway by thee; * for thou hast holden me by my right hand.<br />
      24 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, * and after that receive me with glory.<br />
      25 Whom have I in heaven but thee? * and there is none upon earth that I desire in comparison of thee.<br />
      26 My flesh and my heart faileth; * but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.<br />
      27 For lo, they that forsake thee shall perish; * thou hast destroyed all them that are unfaithful unto thee.<br />
      28 But it is good for me to hold me fast by God, to put my trust in the Lord GOD, * and to speak of all thy works in the gates of the daughter of Sion.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 74. Ut quid, Deus?</strong><br />
      O GOD, wherefore art thou absent from us so long? * why is thy wrath so hot against the sheep of thy pasture?<br />
      2 O think upon thy congregation, * whom thou hast purchased, and redeemed of old.<br />
      3 Think upon the tribe of thine inheritance, * and Mount Sion, wherein thou hast dwelt.<br />
      4 Lift up thy feet, that thou mayest utterly destroy every enemy, * which hath done evil in thy sanctuary.<br />
      5 Thine adversaries roar in the midst of thy congregations, * and set up their banners for tokens.<br />
      6 He that hewed timber afore out of the thick trees, * was known to bring it to an excellent work.<br />
      7 But now they break down all the carved work thereof * with axes and hammers.<br />
      8 They have set fire upon thy holy places, * and have defiled the dwelling-place of thy Name, even unto the ground.<br />
      9 Yea, they said in their hearts, Let us make havoc of them altogether: * thus have they burnt up all the houses of God in the land.<br />
      10 We see not our tokens; there is not one prophet more; * no, not one is there among us, that understandeth any more.<br />
      11 O God, how long shall the adversary do this dishonour? * shall the enemy blaspheme thy Name for ever?<br />
      12 Why withdrawest thou thy hand? * why pluckest thou not thy right hand out of thy bosom to consume the enemy?<br />
      13 For God is my King of old; * the help that is done upon earth, he doeth it himself.<br />
      14 Thou didst divide the sea through thy power; * thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.<br />
      15 Thou smotest the heads of leviathan in pieces, * and gavest him to be meat for the people of the wilderness.<br />
      16 Thou broughtest out fountains and waters out of the hard rocks; * thou driedst up mighty waters.<br />
      17 The day is thine, and the night is thine; * thou hast prepared the light and the sun.<br />
      18 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth; * thou hast made summer and winter.<br />
      19 Remember this, O LORD, how the enemy hath rebuked; * and how the foolish people hath blasphemed thy Name.<br />
      20 O deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the multitude of the enemies; * and forget not the congregation of the poor for ever.<br />
      21 Look upon the covenant; * for all the earth is full of darkness and cruel habitations.<br />
      22 O let not the simple go away ashamed; * but let the poor and needy give praise unto thy Name.<br />
      23 Arise, O God, maintain thine own cause; * remember how the foolish man blasphemeth thee daily.<br />
    24 Forget not the voice of thine enemies: * the presumption of them that hate thee increaseth ever more and more.
