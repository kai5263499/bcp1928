      <P><B>Psalm 91. Qui habitat.</B><BR>
      WHOSO dwelleth under the defence of the Most High, * shall abide
      under the shadow of the Almighty.<BR>
      2 I will say unto the LORD, Thou art my hope, and my stronghold;
      * my God, in him will I trust.<BR>
      3 For he shall deliver thee from the snare of the hunter, * and
      from the noisome pestilence.<BR>
      4 He shall defend thee under his wings, and thou shalt be safe
      under his feathers; * his faithfulness and truth shall be thy
      shield and buckler.<BR>
      5 Thou shalt not be afraid for any terror by night, * nor for
      the arrow that flieth by day;<BR>
      6 For the pestilence that walketh in darkness, * nor for the
      sickness that destroyeth in the noon-day.<BR>
      7 A thousand shall fall beside thee, and ten thousand at thy
      right hand; * but it shall not come nigh thee.<BR>
      8 Yea, with thine eyes shalt thou behold, * and see the reward
      of the ungodly.<BR>
      9 For thou, LORD, art my hope; * thou hast set thine house of
      defence very high.<BR>
      10 There shall no evil happen unto thee, * neither shall any
      plague come nigh thy dwelling.<BR>
      11 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, * to keep thee
      in all thy ways.<BR>
      12 They shall bear thee in their hands, * that thou hurt not
      thy foot against a stone.<BR>
      13 Thou shalt go upon the lion and adder: * the young lion and
      the dragon shalt thou tread under thy feet.<BR>
      14 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver
      him; * I will set him up, because he hath known my Name.<BR>
      15 He shall call upon me, and I will hear him; * yea, I am with
      him in trouble; I will deliver him, and bring him to honour.<BR>
      16 With long life will I satisfy him, * and show him my salvation.
