      <P><B>Psalm 77. Voce mea ad Dominum.</B><BR>
      I WILL cry unto God with my voice; * even unto God will I cry
      with my voice, and he shall hearken unto me.<BR>
      2 In the time of my trouble I sought the Lord: * I stretched
      forth my hands unto him, and ceased not in the night season;
      my soul refused comfort.<BR>
      3 When I am in heaviness, I will think upon God; * when my heart
      is vexed, I will complain.<BR>
      4 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: * I am so feeble that I cannot
      speak.<BR>
      5 I have considered the days of old, * and the years that are
      past.<BR>
      6 I call to remembrance my song, * and in the night I commune
      with mine own heart, and search out my spirit.<BR>
      7 Will the Lord absent himself for ever? * and will he be no
      more intreated?<BR>
      8 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? * and is his promise come
      utterly to an end for evermore?<BR>
      9 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? * and will he shut up his
      loving-kindness in displeasure?<BR>
      10 And I said, It is mine own infirmity; * but I will remember
      the years of the right hand of the Most Highest.<BR>
      11 I will remember the works of the LORD, * and call to mind
      thy wonders of old time.<BR>
      12 I will think also of all thy works, * and my talking shall
      be of thy doings.<BR>
      13 Thy way, O God, is holy: * who is so great a God as our God?<BR>
      14 Thou art the God that doest wonders, * and hast declared thy
      power among the peoples.<BR>
      15 Thou hast mightily delivered thy people, * even the sons of
      Jacob and Joseph.<BR>
      16 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee, and were
      afraid; * the depths also were troubled.<BR>
      17 The clouds poured out water, the air thundered, * and thine
      arrows went abroad.<BR>
      18 The voice of thy thunder was heard round about: * the lightnings
      shone upon the ground; the earth was moved, and shook withal.<BR>
      19 Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in the great waters,
      * and thy footsteps are not known.<BR>
      20 Thou leddest thy people like sheep, * by the hand of Moses
      and Aaron.
