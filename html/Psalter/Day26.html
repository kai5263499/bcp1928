      <P><CENTER>The Twenty-sixth Day.<BR>
<BR>
      Morning Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P>XIV. Lucerna pedibus meis.<BR>
      THY word is a lantern unto my feet, * and a light unto my paths.<BR>
      106 I have sworn, and am stedfastly purposed, * to keep thy righteous
      judgments.<BR>
      107 I am troubled above measure: * quicken me, O LORD, according
      to thy word.<BR>
      108 Let the free-will offerings of my mouth please thee, O LORD;
      * and teach me thy judgments.<BR>
      109 My soul is alway in my hand; * yet do I not forget thy law.<BR>
      110 The ungodly have laid a snare for me; * but yet I swerved
      not from thy commandments.<BR>
      111 Thy testimonies have I claimed as mine heritage for ever;
      * and why? they are the very joy of my heart.<BR>
      112 I have applied my heart to fulfil thy statutes alway, * even
      unto the end.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      XV. Iniquos odio habui.<BR>
      I HATE them that imagine evil things; * but thy law do I love.<BR>
      114 Thou art my defence and shield; * and my trust is in thy
      word.<BR>
      115 Away from me, ye wicked; * I will keep the commandments of
      my God.<BR>
      116 O stablish me according to thy word, that I may live; * and
      let me not be disappointed of my hope.<BR>
      117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe; * yea, my delight shall
      be ever in thy statutes.<BR>
      118 Thou hast trodden down all them that depart from thy statutes;
      * for they imagine but deceit.<BR>
      119 Thou puttest away all the ungodly of the earth like dross;
      * therefore I love thy testimonies.<BR>
      120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; * and I am afraid of
      thy judgments.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      XVI. Feci judicium.<BR>
      I DEAL with the thing that is lawful and right; * O give me not
      over unto mine oppressors.<BR>
      122 Make thou thy servant to delight in that which is good, *
      that the proud do me no wrong.<BR>
      123 Mine eyes are wasted away with looking for thy health, *
      and for the word of thy righteousness.<BR>
      124 O deal with thy servant according unto thy loving mercy,
      * and teach me thy statutes.<BR>
      125 I am thy servant; O grant me understanding, * that I may
      know thy testimonies.<BR>
      126 It is time for thee, LORD, to lay to thine hand; * for they
      have destroyed thy law.<BR>
      127 For I love thy commandments * above gold and precious stones.<BR>
      128 Therefore hold I straight all thy commandments; * and all
      false ways I utterly abhor.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      XVII. Mirabilia.<BR>
      THY testimonies are wonderful; * therefore doth my soul keep
      them.<BR>
      130 When thy word goeth forth, * it giveth light and understanding
      unto the simple.<BR>
      131 I opened my mouth, and drew in my breath; * for my delight
      was in thy commandments.<BR>
      132 O look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, * as thou usest
      to do unto those that love thy Name.<BR>
      133 Order my steps in thy word; * and so shall no wickedness
      have dominion over me.<BR>
      134 O deliver me from the wrongful dealings of men; * and so
      shall I keep thy commandments.<BR>
      135 Show the light of thy countenance upon thy servant, * and
      teach me thy statutes.<BR>
      136 Mine eyes gush out with water, * because men keep not thy
      law.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      XVIII. Justus es, Domine.<BR>
      RIGHTEOUS art thou, O LORD; * and true are thy judgments.<BR>
      138 The testimonies that thou hast commanded * are exceeding
      righteous and true.<BR>
      139 My zeal hath even consumed me; * because mine enemies have
      forgotten thy words.<BR>
      140 Thy word is tried to the uttermost, * and thy servant loveth
      it.<BR>
      141 I am small and of no reputation; * yet do I not forget thy
      commandments.<BR>
      142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, * and
      thy law is the truth.<BR>
      143 Trouble and heaviness have taken hold upon me; * yet is my
      delight in thy commandments.<BR>
      144 The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: * O
      grant me understanding, and I shall live.<BR>
      </P>

      <P><CENTER><A NAME="anchor472144"></A>Evening Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P>XIX. Clamavi in toto corde meo.<BR>
      I CALL with my whole heart; * hear me, O LORD; I will keep thy
      statutes.<BR>
      146 Yea, even unto thee do I call; * help me, and I shall keep
      thy testimonies.<BR>
      147 Early in the morning do I cry unto thee; * for in thy word
      is my trust.<BR>
      148 Mine eyes prevent the night watches; * that I might be occupied
      in thy word.<BR>
      149 Hear my voice, O LORD, according unto thy lovingkindness;
      * quicken me, according to thy judgments.<BR>
      150 They draw nigh that of malice persecute me, * and are far
      from thy law.<BR>
      151 Be thou nigh at hand, O LORD; * for all thy commandments
      are true.<BR>
      152 As concerning thy testimonies, I have known long since, *
      that thou hast grounded them for ever.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      XX. Vide humilitatem.<BR>
      O CONSIDER mine adversity, and deliver me, * for I do not forget
      thy law.<BR>
      154 Avenge thou my cause, and deliver me; * quicken me according
      to thy word.<BR>
      155 Health is far from the ungodly; * for they regard not thy
      statutes.<BR>
      156 Great is thy mercy, O LORD; * quicken me, as thou art wont.<BR>
      157 Many there are that trouble me, and persecute me; * yet do
      I not swerve from thy testimonies.<BR>
      158 It grieveth me when I see the transgressors; * because they
      keep not thy law.<BR>
      159 Consider, O LORD, how I love thy commandments; * O quicken
      me, according to thy loving-kindness.<BR>
      160 Thy word is true from everlasting; * all the judgments of
      thy righteousness endure for evermore.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      XXI. Principes persecuti sunt.<BR>
      PRINCES have persecuted me without a cause; * but my heart standeth
      in awe of thy word.<BR>
      162 I am as glad of thy word, * as one that findeth great spoils.<BR>
      163 As for lies, I hate and abhor them; * but thy law do I love.<BR>
      164 Seven times a day do I praise thee; * because of thy righteous
      judgments.<BR>
      165 Great is the peace that they have who love thy law; * and
      they have none occasion of stumbling.<BR>
      166 LORD, I have looked for thy saving health, * and done after
      thy commandments.<BR>
      167 My soul hath kept thy testimonies, * and loved them exceedingly.<BR>
      168 I have kept thy commandments and testimonies; * for all my
      ways are before thee.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      XXII. Appropinquet deprecatio.<BR>
      LET my complaint come before thee, O LORD; * give me understanding
      according to thy word.<BR>
      170 Let my supplication come before thee; * deliver me according
      to thy word.<BR>
      171 My lips shall speak of thy praise, * when thou hast taught
      me thy statutes.<BR>
      172 Yea, my tongue shall sing of thy word; * for all thy commandments
      are righteous.<BR>
      173 Let thine hand help me; * for I have chosen thy commandments.<BR>
      174 I have longed for thy saving health, O LORD; * and in thy
      law is my delight.<BR>
      175 O let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; * and thy judgments
      shall help me.<BR>
      176 I have gone astray like a sheep that is lost; * O seek thy
      servant, for I do not forget thy commandments.<BR>
