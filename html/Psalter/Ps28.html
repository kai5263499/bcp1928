      <P><B>Psalms 28. Ad te, Domine.</B><BR>
      UNTO thee will I cry, O LORD, my strength: * think no scorn of
      me; lest, if thou make as though thou hearest not, I become like
      them that go down into the pit.<BR>
      2 Hear the voice of my humble petitions, when I cry unto thee;
      * when I hold up my hands towards the mercyseat of thy holy temple.<BR>
      3 O pluck me not away, neither destroy me with the ungodly and
      wicked doers, * which speak friendly to their neighbours, but
      imagine mischief in their hearts.<BR>
      4 Reward them according to their deeds, * and according to the
      wickedness of their own inventions.<BR>
      5 Recompense them after the work of their hands; * pay them that
      they have deserved.<BR>
      6 For they regard not in their mind the works of the LORD, nor
      the operation of his hands; * therefore shall he break them down,
      and not build them up.<BR>
      7 Praised be the LORD; * for he hath heard the voice of my humble
      petitions.<BR>
      8 The LORD is my strength, and my shield; my heart hath trusted
      in him, and I am helped; * therefore my heart danceth for joy,
      and in my song will I praise him.<BR>
      9 The LORD is my strength, * and he is the wholesome defence
      of his anointed.<BR>
      10 O save thy people, and give thy blessing unto thine inheritance:
      * feed them, and set them up for ever.
