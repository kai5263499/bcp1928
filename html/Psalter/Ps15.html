      <P><B>Psalms 15<FONT COLOR="#000000"> </FONT>. Domine, quis habitabit?</B><BR>
      LORD, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? * or who shall rest
      upon thy holy hill?<BR>
      2 Even he that leadeth an uncorrupt life, * and doeth the thing
      which is right, and speaketh the truth from his heart.<BR>
      3 He that hath used no deceit in his tongue, nor done evil to
      his neighbour, * and hath not slandered his neighbour.<BR>
      4 He that setteth not by himself, but is lowly in his own eyes,
      * and maketh much of them that fear the LORD.<BR>
      5 He that sweareth unto his neighbour, and disappointeth him
      not, * though it were to his own hindrance.<BR>
      6 He that hath not given his money upon usury, * nor taken reward
      against the innocent.<BR>
      7 Whoso doeth these things * shall never fall.
