    <p><strong>Psalm 9. Confitebor tibi.</strong><br />
      I WILL give thanks unto thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; * I will speak of all thy marvellous works.<br />
      2 I will be glad and rejoice in thee; * yea, my songs will I make of thy Name, O thou Most Highest.<br />
      3 While mine enemies are driven back, * they shall fall and perish at thy presence.<br />
      4 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; * thou art set in the throne that judgest right.<br />
      5 Thou hast rebuked the heathen, and destroyed the ungodly; * thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.<br />
      6 O thou enemy, thy destructions are come to a perpetual end; * even as the cities which thou hast destroyed, whose memorial is perished with them.<br />
      7 But the LORD shall endure for ever; * he hath also prepared his seat for judgment.<br />
      8 For he shall judge the world in righteousness, * and minister true judgment unto the people.<br />
      9 The LORD also will be a defence for the oppressed, * even a refuge in due time of trouble.<br />
      10 And they that know thy Name will put their trust in thee; * for thou, LORD, hast never failed them that seek thee.<br />
      11 O praise the LORD which dwelleth in Sion; * show the people of his doings.<br />
      12 For when he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them, * and forgetteth not the complaint of the poor.<br />
      13 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider the trouble which I suffer of them that hate me, * thou that liftest me up from the gates of death;<br />
      14 That I may show all thy praises within the gates of the daughter of Sion: * I will rejoice in thy salvation.<br />
      15 The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made; * in the same net which they hid privily is their foot taken.<br />
      16 The LORD is known to execute judgment; * the ungodly is trapped in the work of his own hands.<br />
      17 The wicked shall be turned to destruction, * and all the people that forget God.<br />
      18 For the poor shall not alway be forgotten; * the patient abiding of the meek shall not perish for ever.<br />
      19 UP, LORD, and let not man have the upper hand; * let the heathen be judged in thy sight.<br />
      20 Put them in fear, O LORD, * that the heathen may know themselves to be but men.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 10. Ut quid, Domine?</strong><br />
      WHY standest thou so far off, O LORD, * and hidest thy face in the needful time of trouble?<br />
      2 The ungodly, for his own lust, doth persecute the poor: * let them be taken in the crafty wiliness that they have imagined.<br />
      3 For the ungodly hath made boast of his own heart's desire, * and speaketh good of the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.<br />
      4 The ungodly is so proud, that he careth not for God, * neither is God in all his thoughts.<br />
      5 His ways are alway grievous; * thy judgments are far above out of his sight, and therefore defieth he all his enemies.<br />
      6 For he hath said in his heart, Tush, I shall never be cast down, * there shall no harm happen unto me.<br />
      7 His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and fraud; * under his tongue is ungodliness and vanity.<br />
      8 He sitteth lurking in the thievish corners of the streets, * and privily in his lurking dens doth he murder the innocent; his eyes are set against the poor.<br />
      9 For he lieth waiting secretly; even as a lion lurketh he in his den, * that he may ravish the poor.<br />
      10 He doth ravish the poor, * when he getteth him into his net.<br />
      11 He falleth down, and humbleth himself, * that the congregation of the poor may fall into the hands of his captains.<br />
      12 He hath said in his heart, Tush, God hath forgotten; * he hideth away his face, and he will never see it.<br />
      13 Arise, O LORD God, and lift up thine hand; * forget not the poor.<br />
      14 Wherefore should the wicked blaspheme God, * while he doth say in his heart, Tush, thou God carest not for it?<br />
      15 Surely thou hast seen it; * for thou beholdest ungodliness and wrong, that thou mayest take the matter into thy hand.<br />
      16 The poor committeth himself unto thee; * for thou art the helper of the friendless.<br />
      17 Break thou the power of the ungodly and malicious; * search out his ungodliness, until thou find none.<br />
      18 The LORD is King for ever and ever, * and the heathen are perished out of the land.<br />
      19 LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the poor; * thou preparest their heart, and thine ear hearkeneth;<br />
    20 To help the fatherless and poor unto their right, * that the man of the earth be no more exalted against them.</p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 11. In Domino confido.</strong><br />
      IN the LORD put I my trust; * how say ye then to my soul, that she should flee as a bird unto the hill?<br />
      2 For lo, the ungodly bend their bow, and make ready their arrows within the quiver, * that they may privily shoot at them which are true of heart.<br />
      3 If the foundations be destroyed, * what can the righteous do?<br />
      4 The LORD is in his holy temple; * the LORD'S seat is in heaven.<br />
      5 His eyes consider the poor, * and his eyelids try the children of men.<br />
      6 The LORD approveth the righteous: * but the ungodly, and him that delighteth in wickedness, doth his soul abhor.<br />
      7 Upon the ungodly he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, storm and tempest: * this shall be their portion to drink.<br />
    8 For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; * his countenance will behold the thing that is just.
