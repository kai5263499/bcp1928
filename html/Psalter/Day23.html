      <P><CENTER>The Twenty-third Day.<BR>
<BR>
      Morning Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 110. Dixit Dominus.</B><BR>
      THE LORD said unto my Lord, * Sit thou on my right hand, until
      I make thine enemies thy footstool.<BR>
      2 The LORD shall send the rod of thy power out of Sion: * be
      thou ruler, even in the midst among thine enemies.<BR>
      3 In the day of thy power shall thy people offer themselves willingly
      with an holy worship: * thy young men come to thee as dew from
      the womb of the morning.<BR>
      4 The LORD sware, and will not repent, * Thou art a Priest for
      ever after the order of Melchizedek.<BR>
      5 The Lord upon thy right hand * shall wound even kings in the
      day of his wrath.<BR>
      6 He shall judge among the heathen; * he shall fill the places
      with the dead bodies, and smite in sunder the heads over divers
      countries.<BR>
      7 He shall drink of the brook in the way; * therefore shall he
      lift up his head.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 111. Confitebor tibi.</B><BR>
      I WILL give thanks unto the LORD with my whole heart, * secretly
      among the faithful, and in the congregation.<BR>
      2 The works of the LORD are great, * sought out of all them that
      have pleasure therein.<BR>
      3 His work is worthy to be praised and had in honour, * and his
      righteousness endureth for ever.<BR>
      4 The merciful and gracious LORD hath so done his marvellous
      works, * that they ought to be had in remembrance.<BR>
      5 He hath given meat unto them that fear him; * he shall ever
      be mindful of his covenant.<BR>
      6 He hath showed his people the power of his works, * that he
      may give them the heritage of the heathen.<BR>
      7 The works of his hands are verity and judgment; * all his commandments
      are true.<BR>
      8 They stand fast for ever and ever, * and are done in truth
      and equity.<BR>
      9 He sent redemption unto his people; * he hath commanded his
      covenant for ever; holy and reverend is his Name.<BR>
      10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; * a good
      understanding have all they that do thereafter; his praise endureth
      for ever.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 112. Beatus vir.</B><BR>
      BLESSED is the man that feareth the LORD; * he hath great delight
      in his commandments.<BR>
      2 His seed shall be mighty upon earth; * the generation of the
      faithful shall be blessed.<BR>
      3 Riches and plenteousness shall be in his house; * and his righteousness
      endureth for ever.<BR>
      4 Unto the godly there ariseth up light in the darkness; * he
      is merciful, loving, and righteous.<BR>
      5 A good man is merciful, and lendeth; * and will guide his words
      with discretion.<BR>
      6 For he shall never be moved: * and the righteous shall be had
      in everlasting remembrance.<BR>
      7 He will not be afraid of any evil tidings; * for his heart
      standeth fast, and believeth in the LORD.<BR>
      8 His heart is stablished, and will not shrink, * until he see
      his desire upon his enemies.<BR>
      9 He hath dispersed abroad, and given to the poor. * and his
      righteousness remaineth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with
      honour.<BR>
      10 The ungodly shall see it, and it shall grieve him; * he shall
      gnash with his teeth, and consume away; the desire of the ungodly
      shall perish.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 113. Laudate, pueri.</B><BR>
      PRAISE the LORD, ye servants; * O praise the Name of the LORD.<BR>
      2 Blessed be the Name of the LORD * from this time forth for
      evermore.<BR>
      3 The LORD'S Name is praised * from the rising up of the sun
      unto the going down of the same.<BR>
      4 The LORD is high above all nations, * and his glory above the
      heavens.<BR>
      5 Who is like unto the LORD our God, that hath his dwelling so
      high, * and yet humbleth himself to behold the things that are
      in heaven and earth!<BR>
      6 He taketh up the simple out of the dust, * and lifteth the
      poor out of the mire;<BR>
      7 That he may set him with the princes, * even with the princes
      of his people.<BR>
      8 He maketh the barren woman to keep house, * and to be a joyful
      mother of children.<BR>

      <P><B>Psalm 114. In exitu Israel.</B><BR>
      WHEN Israel came out of Egypt, * and the house of Jacob from
      among the strange people,<BR>
      2 Judah was his sanctuary, * and Israel his dominion.<BR>
      3 The sea saw that, and fled; * Jordan was driven back.<BR>
      4 The mountains skipped like rams, * and the little hills like
      young sheep.<BR>
      5 What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? * and thou
      Jordan, that thou wast driven back?<BR>
      6 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams? * and ye little hills,
      like young sheep?<BR>
      7 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord: * at the
      presence of the God of Jacob;<BR>
      8 Who turned the hard rock into a standing water, ': and the
      flint-stone into a springing well.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 115. Non nobis, Domine.</B><BR>
      NOT unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy Name give the
      praise; * for thy loving mercy, and for thy truth's sake.<BR>
      2 Wherefore shall the heathen say, * Where is now their God?<BR>
      3 As for our God, he is in heaven: * he hath done whatsoever
      pleased him.<BR>
      4 Their idols are silver and gold, * even the work of men's hands.<BR>
      5 They have mouths, and speak not; * eyes have they, and see
      not.<BR>
      6 They have ears, and hear not; * noses have they, and smell
      not.<BR>
      7 They have hands, and handle not; feet have they, and walk not;
      * neither speak they through their throat.<BR>
      8 They that make them are like unto them; * and so are all such
      as put their trust in them.<BR>
      9 But thou, house of Israel, trust thou in the LORD; * he is
      their helper and defender.<BR>
      10 Ye house of Aaron, put your trust in the LORD; * he is their
      helper and defender.<BR>
      11 Ye that fear the LORD, put your trust in the LORD; * he is
      their helper and defender.<BR>
      12 The LORD hath been mindful of us, and he shall bless us; *
      even he shall bless the house of Israel, he shall bless the house
      of Aaron.<BR>
      13 He shall bless them that fear the LORD, * both small and great.<BR>
      14 The LORD shall increase you more and more, * you and your
      children.<BR>
      15 Ye are the blessed of the LORD, * who made heaven and earth.<BR>
      16 All the whole heavens are the LORD'S; * the earth hath he
      given to the children of men.<BR>
      17 The dead praise not thee, O LORD, * neither all they that
      go down into silence.<BR>
      18 But we will praise the LORD, * from this time forth for evermore.
      Praise the LORD.<BR>
