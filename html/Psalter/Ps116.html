      <P><B>Psalm 116. Dilexi, quoniam.</B><BR>
      MY delight is in the LORD; * because he hath heard the voice
      of my prayer;<BR>
      2 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me; * therefore will
      I call upon him as long as I live.<BR>
      3 The snares of death compassed me round about, * and the pains
      of hell gat hold upon me.<BR>
      4 I found trouble and heaviness; then called I upon the Name
      of the LORD; * O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.<BR>
      5 Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; * yea, our God is merciful.<BR>
      6 The LORD preserveth the simple: * I was in misery, and he helped
      me.<BR>
      7 Turn again then unto thy rest, O my soul; * for the LORD hath
      rewarded thee.<BR>
      8 And why? thou hast delivered my soul from death, * mine eyes
      from tears, and my feet from falling.<BR>
      9 I will walk before the LORD * in the land of the living.<BR>
      10 I believed, and therefore will I speak; but I was sore troubled:
      * I said in my haste, All men are liars.<BR>
      11 What reward shall I give unto the LORD * for all the benefits
      that he hath done unto me?<BR>
      12 I will receive the cup of salvation, * and call upon the Name
      of the LORD.<BR>
      13 I will pay my vows now in the presence of all his people:
      * right dear in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.<BR>
      14 Behold, O LORD, how that I am thy servant; * I am thy servant,
      and the son of thine handmaid; thou hast broken my bonds in sunder.<BR>
      15 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, * and
      will call upon the Name of the LORD.<BR>
      16 I will pay my vows unto the LORD, in the sight of all his
      people, * in the courts of the LORD'S house; even in the midst
      of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise the LORD.
