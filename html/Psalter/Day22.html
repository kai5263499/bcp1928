<BR>
      Morning Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 107. Confitemini Domino.</B><BR>
      O GIVE thanks unto the LORD, for he is gracious, * and his mercy
      endureth for ever.<BR>
      2 Let them give thanks whom the LORD hath redeemed, * and delivered
      from the hand of the enemy;<BR>
      3 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from
      the west; * from the north, and from the south.<BR>
      4 They went astray in the wilderness out of the way, * and found
      no city to dwell in.<BR>
      5 Hungry and thirsty, * their soul fainted in them.<BR>
      6 So they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, * and he delivered
      them from their distress.<BR>
      7 He led them forth by the right way, * that they might go to
      the city where they dwelt.<BR>
      8 O that men would therefore praise the LORD for his goodness;
      * and declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men!<BR>
      9 For he satisfieth the empty soul, * and filleth the hungry
      soul with goodness.<BR>
      10 Such as sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death, * being
      fast bound in misery and iron;<BR>
      11 Because they rebelled against the words of the Lord, * and
      lightly regarded the counsel of the Most Highest;<BR>
      12 He also brought down their heart through heaviness: * they
      fell down, and there was none to help them.<BR>
      13 SO when they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, * he delivered
      them out of their distress.<BR>
      14 For he brought them out of darkness, and out of the shadow
      of death, * and brake their bonds in sunder.<BR>
      15 O that men would therefore praise the LORD for his goodness;
      * and declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men
      !<BR>
      16 For he hath broken the gates of brass, * and smitten the bars
      of iron in sunder.<BR>
      17 Foolish men are plagued for their offence, * and because of
      their wickedness.<BR>
      18 Their soul abhorred all manner of meat, * and they were even
      hard at death's door.<BR>
      19 So when they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, * he delivered
      them out of their distress.<BR>
      20 He sent his word, and healed them; * and they were saved from
      their destruction.<BR>
      21 O that men would therefore praise the LORD for his goodness;
      * and declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men
      !<BR>
      22 That they would offer unto him the sacrifice of thanksgiving,
      * and tell out his works with gladness!<BR>
      23 They that go down to the sea in ships, * and occupy their
      business in great waters;<BR>
      24 These men see the works of the LORD, * and his wonders in
      the deep.<BR>
      25 For at his word the stormy wind ariseth, * which lifteth up
      the waves thereof.<BR>
      26 They are carried up to the heaven, and down again to the deep;
      * their soul melteth away because of the trouble.<BR>
      27 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, * and
      are at their wit's end.<BR>
      28 SO when they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, * he delivereth
      them out of their distress.<BR>
      29 For he maketh the storm to cease, * so that the waves thereof
      are still.<BR>
      30 Then are they glad, because they are at rest; * and so he
      bringeth them unto the haven where they would be.<BR>
      31 O that men would therefore praise the LORD for his goodness;
      * and declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men!<BR>
      32 That they would exalt him also in the congregation of the
      people, * and praise him in the seat of the elders!<BR>
      33 He turneth the floods into a wilderness, * and drieth up the
      water-springs.<BR>
      34 A fruitful land maketh he barren, * for the wickedness of
      them that dwell therein.<BR>
      35 Again, he maketh the wilderness a standing water, * and water-springs
      of a dry ground.<BR>
      36 And there he setteth the hungry, * that they may build them
      a city to dwell in;<BR>
      37 That they may sow their land, and plant vineyards, * to yield
      them fruits of increase.<BR>
      38 He blesseth them, so that they multiply exceedingly; * and
      suffereth not their cattle to decrease.<BR>
      39 And again, when they are minished and brought low * through
      oppression, through any plague or trouble;<BR>
      40 Though he suffer them to be evil entreated through tyrants,
      * and let them wander out of the way in the wilderness;<BR>
      41 Yet helpeth he the poor out of misery, * and maketh him households
      like a flock of sheep.<BR>
      42 The righteous will consider this, and rejoice; * and the mouth
      of all wickedness shall be stopped.<BR>
      43 Whoso is wise, will ponder these things; * and they shall
      understand the loving-kindness of the LORD.<BR>

      <P><CENTER><A NAME="anchor464366"></A>Evening Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 108. Paratum cor meum.</B><BR>
      O GOD, my heart is ready, my heart is ready; * I will sing, and
      give praise with the best member that I have.<BR>
      2 Awake, thou lute and harp; * I myself will awake right early.<BR>
      3 I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the peoples; *
      I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.<BR>
      4 For thy mercy is greater than the heavens, * and thy truth
      reacheth unto the clouds.<BR>
      5 Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens, * and thy glory above
      all the earth;<BR>
      6 That thy beloved may be delivered: * let thy right hand save
      them, and hear thou me.<BR>
      7 God hath spoken in his holiness; * I will rejoice therefore,
      and divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.<BR>
      8 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; * Ephraim also is the
      strength of my head; Judah is my lawgiver;<BR>
      9 Moab is my wash-pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; * upon
      Philistia will I triumph.<BR>
      10 Who will lead me into the strong city? * and who will bring
      me into Edom?<BR>
      11 Hast not thou forsaken us, O God? * and wilt not thou, O God,
      go forth with our hosts?<BR>
      12 O help us against the enemy: * for vain is the help of man.<BR>
      13 Through God we shall do great acts; * and it is he that shall
      tread down our enemies.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 109. Deus, laudem.</B><BR>
      HOLD not thy tongue, O God of my praise; * for the mouth of the
      ungodly, yea, the mouth of the deceitful is opened upon me.<BR>
      2 And they have spoken against me with false tongues; * they
      compassed me about also with words of hatred, and fought against
      me without a cause.<BR>
      3 For the love that I had unto them, lo, they take now my contrary
      part; * but I give myself unto prayer.<BR>
      4 Thus have they rewarded me evil for good, * and hatred for
      my good will.<BR>
      5 Set thou an ungodly man to be ruler over him, * and let an
      adversary stand at his right hand.<BR>
      6 When sentence is given upon him, let him be condemned; * and
      let his prayer be turned into sin.<BR>
      7 Let his days be few; * and let another take his office.<BR>
      8 Let his children be fatherless, * and his wife a widow.<BR>
      9 Let his children be vagabonds, and beg their bread; * let them
      seek it also out of desolate places.<BR>
      10 Let the extortioner consume all that he hath; * and let the
      stranger spoil his labour.<BR>
      11 Let there be no man to pity him, * nor to have compassion
      upon his fatherless children.<BR>
      12 Let his posterity be destroyed; * and in the NEXT <!-- Start Superstats code version 7.0b.  Copyright 2008 MyComputer.com, Inc.

      let his name be clean put out.<BR>
      13 Let the wickedness of his fathers be had in remembrance in
      the sight of the LORD; * and let not the sin of his mother be
      done away.<BR>
      14 Let them alway be before the LORD, * that he may root out
      the memorial of them from off the earth;<BR>
      15 And that, because his mind was not to do good; * but persecuted
      the poor helpless man, that he might slay him that was vexed
      at the heart.<BR>
      16 His delight was in cursing, and it shall happen unto him;
      * he loved not blessing, therefore shall it be far from him.<BR>
      17 He clothed himself with cursing like as with a raiment, *
      and it shall come into his bowels like water, and like oil into
      his bones.<BR>
      18 Let it be unto him as the cloak that he hath upon him, * and
      as the girdle that he is alway girded withal.<BR>
      19 Let it thus happen from the LORD unto mine enemies, * and
      to those that speak evil against my soul.<BR>
      20 But deal thou with me, O LORD God, according unto thy Name;
      * for sweet is thy mercy.<BR>
      21 O deliver me, for I am helpless and poor, ~ and my heart is
      wounded within me.<BR>
      22 I go hence like the shadow that departeth, * and am driven
      away as the grasshopper.<BR>
      23 My knees are weak through fasting; * my flesh is dried up
      for want of fatness.<BR>
      24 I am become also a reproach unto them: * they that look upon
      me shake their heads.<BR>
      25 Help me, O LORD my God; * O save me according to thy mercy;<BR>
      26 And they shall know how that this is thy hand, * and that
      thou, LORD, hast done it.<BR>
      27 Though they curse, yet bless thou; * and let them be confounded
      that rise up against me; but let thy servant rejoice.<BR>
      28 Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame; * and let them
      cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a cloak.<BR>
      29 As for me, I will give great thanks unto the LORD with my
      mouth, * and praise him among the multitude;<BR>
      30 For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, * to save
      his soul from unrighteous judges.<BR>
