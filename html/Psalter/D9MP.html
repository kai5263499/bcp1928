    <p><strong>Psalm 44. Deus, auribus.</strong><br />
      WE have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us * what thou hast done in their time of old:<br />
      2 How thou hast driven out the heathen with thy hand, and planted our fathers in; * how thou hast destroyed the nations, and made thy people to flourish.<br />
      3 For they gat not the land in possession through their own sword, * neither was it their own arm that helped them;<br />
      4 But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance; * because thou hadst a favour unto them.<br />
      5 Thou art my King, O God; * send help unto Jacob.<br />
      6 Through thee will we overthrow our enemies, * and in thy Name will we tread them under that rise up against us.<br />
      7 For I will not trust in my bow, * it is not my sword that shall help me;<br />
      8 But it is thou that savest us from our enemies, * and puttest them to confusion that hate us.<br />
      9 We make our boast of God all day long, * and will praise thy Name for ever.<br />
      10 But now thou art far off, and puttest us to confusion, * and goest not forth with our armies.<br />
      11 Thou makest us to turn our backs upon our enemies, * so that they which hate us spoil our goods.<br />
      12 Thou lettest us be eaten up like sheep, * and hast scattered us among the heathen.<br />
      13 Thou sellest thy people for nought, * and takest no money for them.<br />
      14 Thou makest us to be rebuked of our neighbours, * to be laughed to scorn, and had in derision of them that are round about us.<br />
      15 Thou makest us to be a by-word among the nations, * and that the peoples shake their heads at us.<br />
      16 My confusion is daily before me, * and the shame of my face hath covered me;<br />
      17 For the voice of the slanderer and blasphemer, * for the enemy and avenger.<br />
      18 And though all this be come upon us, yet do we not forget thee, * nor behave ourselves frowardly in thy covenant.<br />
      19 Our heart is not turned back, * neither our steps gone out of thy way;<br />
      20 No, not when thou hast smitten us into the place of dragons, * and covered us with the shadow of death.<br />
      21 If we have forgotten the Name of our God, and holden up our hands to any strange god, * shall not God search it out? for he knoweth the very secrets of the heart.<br />
      22 For thy sake also are we killed all the day long, * and are counted as sheep appointed to be slain.<br />
      23 Up, Lord, why sleepest thou? * awake, and be not absent from us for ever.<br />
      24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, * and forgettest our misery and trouble?<br />
      25 For our soul is brought low, even unto the dust; * our belly cleaveth unto the ground.<br />
      26 Arise, and help us, * and deliver us, for thy mercy's sake.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 45. Eructavit cor meum.</strong><br />
      MY heart overfloweth with a good matter; I speak the things which I have made concerning the King. * My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.<br />
      2 Thou art fairer than the children of men; * full of grace are thy lips, because God hath blessed thee for ever.<br />
      3 Gird thee with thy sword upon thy thigh, O thou Most Mighty, * according to thy worship and renown.<br />
      4 Good luck have thou with thine honour: * ride on, because of the word of truth, of meekness, and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.<br />
      5 Thy arrows are very sharp in the heart of the King's enemies, * and the people shall be subdued unto thee.<br />
      6 Thy seat, O God, endureth for ever; * the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.<br />
      7 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; * wherefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.<br />
      8 All thy garments smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia; * out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.<br />
      9 Kings' daughters are among thy honourable women; * upon thy right hand doth stand the queen in a vesture of gold, wrought about with divers colours.<br />
      10 Hearken, O daughter, and consider; incline thine ear; * forget also thine own people, and thy father's house.<br />
      11 So shall the King have pleasure in thy beauty; * for he is thy Lord, and worship thou him.<br />
      12 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; * like as the rich also among the people shall make their supplication before thee.<br />
      13 The King's daughter is all glorious within; * her clothing is of wrought gold.<br />
      14 She shall be brought unto the King in raiment of needlework: * the virgins that be her fellows shall bear her company, and shall be brought unto thee.<br />
      15 With joy and gladness shall they be brought, * and shall enter into the King's palace.<br />
      16 Instead of thy fathers, thou shalt have children, * whom thou mayest make princes in all lands.<br />
      17 I will make thy Name to be remembered from one generation to another; * therefore shall the people give thanks unto thee, world without end.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 46. Deus noster refugium.</strong><br />
      GOD is our hope and strength, * a very present help in trouble.<br />
      2 Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be moved, * and though the hills be carried into the midst of the sea;<br />
      3 Though the waters thereof rage and swell, * and though the mountains shake at the tempest of the same.<br />
      4 There is a river, the streams whereof make glad the city of God; * the holy place of the tabernacle of the Most Highest.<br />
      5 God is in the midst of her, therefore shall she not be removed; * God shall help her, and that right early.<br />
      6 The nations make much ado, and the kingdoms are moved; * but God hath showed his voice, and the earth shall melt away.<br />
      7 The LORD of hosts is with us; * the God of Jacob is our refuge.<br />
      8 O come hither, and behold the works of the LORD, * what destruction he hath brought upon the earth.<br />
      9 He maketh wars to cease in all the world; * he breaketh the bow, and knappeth the spear in sunder, and burneth the chariots in the fire.<br />
      10 Be still then, and know that I am God: * I will be exalted among the nations, and I will be exalted in the earth.<br />
    11 The LORD of hosts is with us; * the God of Jacob is our refuge.
