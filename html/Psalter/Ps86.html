      <P><B>Psalm 86. Inclina, Domine.</B><BR>
      BOW down thine ear, O LORD, and hear me; * for I am poor, and
      in misery.<BR>
      2 Preserve thou my soul, for I am holy: * my God, save thy servant
      that putteth his trust in thee.<BR>
      3 Be merciful unto me, O Lord; * for I will call daily upon thee.<BR>
      4 Comfort the soul of thy servant; * for unto thee, O Lord, do
      I lift up my soul.<BR>
      5 For thou, Lord, art good and gracious, * and of great mercy
      unto all them that call upon thee.<BR>
      6 Give ear, LORD, unto my prayer, * and ponder the voice of my
      humble desires.<BR>
      7 In the time of my trouble I will call upon thee; * for thou
      hearest me.<BR>
      8 Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; * there
      is not one that can do as thou doest.<BR>
      9 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship thee,
      O Lord; * and shall glorify thy Name.<BR>
      10 For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: * thou art
      God alone.<BR>
      11 Teach me thy way, O LORD, and I will walk in thy truth: *
      O knit my heart unto thee, that I may fear thy Name.<BR>
      12 I will thank thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart; * and
      will praise thy Name for evermore.<BR>
      13 For great is thy mercy toward me; * and thou hast delivered
      my soul from the nethermost hell.<BR>
      14 O God, the proud are risen against me; * and the congregations
      of violent men have sought after my soul, and have not set thee
      before their eyes.<BR>
      15 But thou, O Lord God, art full of compassion and mercy, *
      long-suffering, plenteous in goodness and truth.<BR>
      16 O turn thee then unto me, and have mercy upon me; * give thy
      strength unto thy servant, and help the son of thine handmaid.<BR>
      17 Show some token upon me for good; that they who hate me may
      see it, and be ashamed, * because thou, LORD, hast holpen me,
      and comforted me.
