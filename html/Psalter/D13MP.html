    <p><strong>Psalm 68. Exsurgat Deus.</strong><br />
      LET God arise, and let his enemies be scattered; * let them also that hate him flee before him.<br />
      2 Like as the smoke vanisheth, so shalt thou drive them away; * and like as wax melteth at the fire, so let the ungodly perish at the presence of God.<br />
      3 But let the righteous be glad, and rejoice before God; * let them also be merry and joyful.<br />
      4 O sing unto God, and sing praises unto his Name; magnify him that rideth upon the heavens; * praise him in his Name JAH, and rejoice before him.<br />
      5 He is a Father of the fatherless, and defendeth the cause of the widows; * even God in his holy habitation.<br />
      6 He is the God that maketh men to be of one mind in an house, and bringeth the prisoners out of captivity; * but letteth the runagates continue in scarceness.<br />
      7 O God, when thou wentest forth before the people; * when thou wentest through the wilderness,<br />
      8 The earth shook, and the heavens dropped at the presence of God; * even as Sinai also was moved at the presence of God, who is the God of Israel.<br />
      9 Thou, O God, sentest a gracious rain upon thine inheritance, * and refreshedst it when it was weary.<br />
      10 Thy congregation shall dwell therein; * for thou, O God, hast of thy goodness prepared for the poor.<br />
      11 The Lord gave the word; * great was the company of women that bare the tidings.<br />
      12 Kings with their armies did flee, and were discomfited, * and they of the household divided the spoil.<br />
      13 Though ye have lain among the sheep-folds, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove * that is covered with silver wings, and her feathers like gold.<br />
      14 When the Almighty scattered kings for their sake, * then were they as white as snow in Salmon.<br />
      15 As the hill of Bashan, so is God's hill; * even an high hill, as the hill of Bashan.<br />
      16 Why mock ye so, ye high hills? this is God's hill, in the which it pleaseth him to dwell; * yea, the LORD will abide in it for ever.<br />
      17 The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels; * and the Lord is among them as in the holy place of Sinai.<br />
      18 Thou art gone up on high, thou hast led captivity captive, and received gifts from men; * yea, even from thine enemies, that the LORD God might dwell among them.<br />
      19 Praised be the Lord daily, * even the God who helpeth us, and poureth his benefits upon us.<br />
      20 He is our God, even the God of whom cometh salvation: * GOD is the Lord, by whom we escape death.<br />
      21 God shall wound the head of his enemies, * and the hairy scalp of such a one as goeth on still in his wickedness.<br />
      22 The Lord hath said, I will bring my people again, as I did from Bashan; * mine own will I bring again, as I did sometime from the deep of the sea.<br />
      23 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, * and that the tongue of thy dogs may be red through the same.<br />
      24 It is well seen, O God, how thou goest; * how thou, my God and King, goest in the sanctuary.<br />
      25 The singers go before, the minstrels follow after, * in the midst of the damsels playing with the timbrels.<br />
      26 Give thanks unto God the Lord in the congregation, * ye that are of the fountain of Israel.<br />
      27 There is little Benjamin their ruler, and the princes of Judah their council; * the princes of Zebulon, and the princes of Naphthali.<br />
      28 Thy God hath sent forth strength for thee; * stablish the thing, O God, that thou hast wrought in us,<br />
      29 For thy temple's sake at Jerusalem; * so shall kings bring presents unto thee.<br />
      30 Rebuke thou the dragon and the bull, with the leaders of the heathen, so that they humbly bring pieces of silver; * scatter thou the peoples that delight in war;<br />
      31 Then shall the princes come out of Egypt; * the Morians' land shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.<br />
      32 Sing unto God, O ye kingdoms of the earth; * O sing praises unto the Lord;<br />
      33 Who sitteth in the heavens over all, from the beginning: * lo, he doth send out his voice; yea, and that a mighty voice.<br />
      34 Ascribe ye the power to God over Israel; * his worship and strength is in the clouds.<br />
    35 O God, wonderful art thou in thy holy places: * even the God of Israel, he will give strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God.
