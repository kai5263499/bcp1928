    <p><strong>Psalm 107. Confitemini Domino.</strong><br />
      O GIVE thanks unto the LORD, for he is gracious, * and his mercy endureth for ever.<br />
      2 Let them give thanks whom the LORD hath redeemed, * and delivered from the hand of the enemy;<br />
      3 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west; * from the north, and from the south.<br />
      4 They went astray in the wilderness out of the way, * and found no city to dwell in.<br />
      5 Hungry and thirsty, * their soul fainted in them.<br />
      6 So they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, * and he delivered them from their distress.<br />
      7 He led them forth by the right way, * that they might go to the city where they dwelt.<br />
      8 O that men would therefore praise the LORD for his goodness; * and declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men!<br />
      9 For he satisfieth the empty soul, * and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.<br />
      10 Such as sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death, * being fast bound in misery and iron;<br />
      11 Because they rebelled against the words of the Lord, * and lightly regarded the counsel of the Most Highest;<br />
      12 He also brought down their heart through heaviness: * they fell down, and there was none to help them.<br />
      13 SO when they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, * he delivered them out of their distress.<br />
      14 For he brought them out of darkness, and out of the shadow of death, * and brake their bonds in sunder.<br />
      15 O that men would therefore praise the LORD for his goodness; * and declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men !<br />
      16 For he hath broken the gates of brass, * and smitten the bars of iron in sunder.<br />
      17 Foolish men are plagued for their offence, * and because of their wickedness.<br />
      18 Their soul abhorred all manner of meat, * and they were even hard at death's door.<br />
      19 So when they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, * he delivered them out of their distress.<br />
      20 He sent his word, and healed them; * and they were saved from their destruction.<br />
      21 O that men would therefore praise the LORD for his goodness; * and declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men !<br />
      22 That they would offer unto him the sacrifice of thanksgiving, * and tell out his works with gladness!<br />
      23 They that go down to the sea in ships, * and occupy their business in great waters;<br />
      24 These men see the works of the LORD, * and his wonders in the deep.<br />
      25 For at his word the stormy wind ariseth, * which lifteth up the waves thereof.<br />
      26 They are carried up to the heaven, and down again to the deep; * their soul melteth away because of the trouble.<br />
      27 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, * and are at their wit's end.<br />
      28 SO when they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, * he delivereth them out of their distress.<br />
      29 For he maketh the storm to cease, * so that the waves thereof are still.<br />
      30 Then are they glad, because they are at rest; * and so he bringeth them unto the haven where they would be.<br />
      31 O that men would therefore praise the LORD for his goodness; * and declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men!<br />
      32 That they would exalt him also in the congregation of the people, * and praise him in the seat of the elders!<br />
      33 He turneth the floods into a wilderness, * and drieth up the water-springs.<br />
      34 A fruitful land maketh he barren, * for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.<br />
      35 Again, he maketh the wilderness a standing water, * and water-springs of a dry ground.<br />
      36 And there he setteth the hungry, * that they may build them a city to dwell in;<br />
      37 That they may sow their land, and plant vineyards, * to yield them fruits of increase.<br />
      38 He blesseth them, so that they multiply exceedingly; * and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.<br />
      39 And again, when they are minished and brought low * through oppression, through any plague or trouble;<br />
      40 Though he suffer them to be evil entreated through tyrants, * and let them wander out of the way in the wilderness;<br />
      41 Yet helpeth he the poor out of misery, * and maketh him households like a flock of sheep.<br />
      42 The righteous will consider this, and rejoice; * and the mouth of all wickedness shall be stopped.<br />
    43 Whoso is wise, will ponder these things; * and they shall understand the loving-kindness of the LORD.
