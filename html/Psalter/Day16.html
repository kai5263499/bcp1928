      The Sixteenth Day.<BR>
<BR>
      Morning Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 79. Deus, venerunt.</B><BR>
      O GOD, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; * thy holy
      temple have they defiled, and made Jerusalem an heap of stones.<BR>
      2 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat
      unto the fowls of the air, * and the flesh of thy saints unto
      the beasts of the land.<BR>
      3 Their blood have they shed like water on every side of Jerusalem,
      * and there was no man to bury them.<BR>
      4 We are become an open shame to our enemies, * a very scorn
      and derision unto them that are round about us.<BR>
      5 LORD, how long wilt thou be angry? * shall thy jealousy burn
      like fire for ever?<BR>
      6 Pour out thine indignation upon the heathen that have not known
      thee; * and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy Name.<BR>
      7 For they have devoured Jacob, * and laid waste his dwelling-place.<BR>
      8 O remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and that
      soon; * for we are come to great misery.<BR>
      9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name:
      * O deliver us, and be merciful unto our sins, for thy Name's
      sake.<BR>
      10 Wherefore do the heathen say, * Where is now their God?<BR>
      11 O let the vengeance of thy servants' blood that is shed, *
      be openly showed upon the heathen, in our sight.<BR>
      12 O let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before thee;
      * according to the greatness of thy power, preserve thou those
      that are appointed to die.<BR>
      13 And for the blasphemy wherewith our neighbours have blasphemed
      thee, * reward thou them, O Lord, sevenfold into their bosom.<BR>
      14 So we, that are thy people, and sheep of thy pasture, shall
      give thee thanks for ever, * and will alway be showing forth
      thy praise from generation to generation.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 80. Qui regis Israel.</B><BR>
      HEAR, O thou Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like
      a flock; * show thyself also, thou that sittest upon the Cherubim.<BR>
      2 Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, * stir up thy strength,
      and come and help us.<BR>
      3 Turn us again, O God; * show the light of thy countenance,
      and we shall be whole.<BR>
      4 O LORD God of hosts, * how long wilt thou be angry with thy
      people that prayeth?<BR>
      5 Thou feedest them with the bread of tears, * and givest them
      plenteousness of tears to drink.<BR>
      6 Thou hast made us a very strife unto our neighbours, * and
      our enemies laugh us to scorn.<BR>
      7 Turn us again, thou God of hosts; * show the light of thy countenance,
      and we shall be whole.<BR>
      8 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt; * thou hast cast out
      the heathen, and planted it.<BR>
      9 Thou madest room for it; * and when it had taken root, it filled
      the land.<BR>
      10 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, * and the boughs
      thereof were like the goodly cedar-trees.<BR>
      11 She stretched out her branches unto the sea, * and her boughs
      unto the River.<BR>
      12 Why hast thou then broken down her hedge, * that all they
      that go by pluck off her grapes?<BR>
      13 The wild boar out of the wood doth root it up, * and the wild
      beasts of the field devour it.<BR>
      14 Turn thee again, thou God of hosts, look down from heaven,
      * behold, and visit this vine;<BR>
      15 And the place of the vineyard that thy right hand hath planted,
      * and the branch that thou madest so strong for thyself.<BR>
      16 It is burnt with fire, and cut down; * and they shall perish
      at the rebuke of thy countenance.<BR>
      17 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, * and upon
      the son of man, whom thou madest so strong for thine own self.<BR>
      18 And so will not we go back from thee: * O let us live, and
      we shall call upon thy Name.<BR>
      19 Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts; * show the light of thy
      countenance, and we shall be whole.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 81. Exultate Deo.</B><BR>
      SING we merrily unto God our strength; * make a cheerful noise
      unto the God of Jacob.<BR>
      2 Take the psalm, bring hither the tabret, * the merry harp with
      the lute.<BR>
      3 Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, * even in the time appointed,
      and upon our solemn feast-day.<BR>
      4 For this was made a statute for Israel, * and a law of the
      God of Jacob.<BR>
      5 This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, * when he came
      out of the land of Egypt, and had heard a strange language.<BR>
      6 I eased his shoulder from the burden, * and his hands were
      delivered from making the pots.<BR>
      7 Thou calledst upon me in troubles, and I delivered thee; *
      and heard thee what time as the storm fell upon thee.<BR>
      8 I proved thee also * at the waters of strife.<BR>
      9 Hear, O my people; and I will assure thee, O Israel, * if thou
      wilt hearken unto me,<BR>
      10 There shall no strange god be in thee, * neither shalt thou
      worship any other god.<BR>
      11 I am the LORD thy God, who brought thee out of the land of
      Egypt: * open thy mouth wide, and I shall fill it.<BR>
      12 But my people would not hear my voice; * and Israel would
      not obey me;<BR>
      13 So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lusts, * and let
      them follow their own imaginations.<BR>
      14 O that my people would have hearkened unto me! * for if Israel
      had walked in my ways,<BR>
      15 I should soon have put down their enemies, * and turned my
      hand against their adversaries.<BR>
      16 The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto
      him; * but their time should have endured for ever.<BR>
      17 I would have fed them also with the finest wheatflour; * and
      with honey out of the stony rock would I have satisfied thee.<BR>

      <P><CENTER><A NAME="anchor449881"></A>Evening Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 82. Deus stetit.</B><BR>
      GOD standeth in the congregation of princes; * he is a Judge
      among gods.<BR>
      2 How long will ye give wrong judgment, * and accept the persons
      of the ungodly?<BR>
      3 Defend the poor and fatherless; * see that such as are in need
      and necessity have right.<BR>
      4 Deliver the outcast and poor; * save them from the hand of
      the ungodly.<BR>
      5 They know not, neither do they understand, but walk on still
      in darkness: * all the foundations of the earth are out of course.<BR>
      6 I have said, Ye are gods, * and ye are all the children of
      the Most Highest.<BR>
      7 But ye shall die like men, * and fall like one of the princes.<BR>
      8 Arise, O God, and judge thou the earth; * for thou shalt take
      all nations to thine inheritance.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 83. Deus, quis similis?</B><BR>
      HOLD not thy tongue, O God, keep not still silence: * refrain
      not thyself, O God.<BR>
      2 For lo, thine enemies make a murmuring; * and they that hate
      thee have lift up their head.<BR>
      3 They have imagined craftily against thy people, * and taken
      counsel against thy secret ones.<BR>
      4 They have said, Come, and let us root them out, that they be
      no more a people, * and that the name of Israel may be no more
      in remembrance.<BR>
      5 For they have cast their heads together with one consent, *
      and are confederate against thee:<BR>
      6 The tabernacles of the Edomites, and the Ishmaelites; * the
      Moabites, and Hagarenes;<BR>
      7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; * the Philistines, with them
      that dwell at Tyre.<BR>
      8 Assyria also is joined with them; * they have holpen the children
      of Lot.<BR>
      9 But do thou to them as unto the Midianites; * unto Sisera,
      and unto Jabin at the brook of Kishon;<BR>
      10 Who perished at Endor, * and became as the dung of the earth.<BR>
      11 Make them and their princes like Oreb and Zeeb; * yea, make
      all their princes like as Zebah and Zalmunna;<BR>
      12 Who say, Let us take to ourselves * the houses of God in possession.<BR>
      13 O my God, make them like unto the whirling dust, * and as
      the stubble before the wind;<BR>
      14 Like as the fire that burneth up the forest, * and as the
      flame that consumeth the mountains;<BR>
      15 Pursue them even so with thy tempest, * and make them afraid
      with thy storm.<BR>
      16 Make their faces ashamed, O LORD, * that they may seek thy
      Name.<BR>
      17 Let them be confounded and vexed ever more and more; * let
      them be put to shame, and perish.<BR>
      18 And they shall know that thou, whose Name is JEHOVAH, * art
      only the Most Highest over all the earth.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 84. Quam dilecta!</B><BR>
      O HOW amiable are thy dwellings, * thou LORD of hosts!<BR>
      2 My soul hath a desire and longing to enter into the courts
      of the LORD; * my heart and my flesh rejoice in the living God.<BR>
      3 Yea, the sparrow hath found her an house, and the swallow a
      nest, where she may lay her young; * even thy altars, O LORD
      of hosts, my King and my God.<BR>
      4 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house; * they will be alway
      praising thee.<BR>
      5 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; * in whose heart
      are thy ways.<BR>
      6 Who going through the vale of misery use it for a well; * and
      the pools are filled with water.<BR>
      7 They will go from strength to strength, * and unto the God
      of gods appeareth every one of them in Sion.<BR>
      8 O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; * hearken, O God of Jacob.<BR>
      9 Behold, O God our defender, * and look upon the face of thine
      anointed.<BR>
      10 For one day in thy courts * is better than a thousand.<BR>
      11 I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God, * than
      to dwell in the tents of ungodliness.<BR>
      12 For the LORD God is a light and defence; * the LORD will give
      grace and worship; and no good thing shall he withhold from them
      that live a godly life.<BR>
      13 O LORD God of hosts, * blessed is the man that putteth his
      trust in thee.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 85. Benedixisti, Domine.</B><BR>
      LORD, thou art become gracious unto thy land; * thou hast turned
      away the captivity of Jacob.<BR>
      2 Thou hast forgiven the offence of thy people, * and covered
      all their sins.<BR>
      3 Thou hast taken away all thy displeasure, * and turned thyself
      from thy wrathful indignation.<BR>
      4 Turn us then, O God our Saviour, * and let thine anger cease
      from us.<BR>
      5 Wilt thou be displeased at us for ever? * and wilt thou stretch
      out thy wrath from one generation to another?<BR>
      6 Wilt thou not turn again, and quicken us, * that thy people
      may rejoice in thee?<BR>
      7 Show us thy mercy, O LORD, * and grant us thy salvation.<BR>
      8 I will hearken what the LORD God will say; * for he shall speak
      peace unto his people, and to his saints, that they turn not
      again unto foolishness.<BR>
      9 For his salvation is nigh them that fear him; * that glory
      may dwell in our land.<BR>
      10 Mercy and truth are met together: * righteousness and peace
      have kissed each other.<BR>
      11 Truth shall flourish out of the earth, * and righteousness
      hath looked down from heaven.<BR>
      12 Yea, the LORD shall show loving-kindness; * and our land shall
      give her increase.<BR>
      13 Righteousness shall go before him, * and shall direct his
      going in the way.</P>
