      <P><B>Psalm 150. Laudate Dominum.</B><BR>
      O PRAISE God in his sanctuary: * praise him in the firmament
      of his power.<BR>
      2 Praise him in his noble acts: * praise him according to his
      excellent greatness.<BR>
      3 Praise him in the sound of the trumpet: * praise him upon the
      lute and harp.<BR>
      4 Praise him in the timbrels and dances: * praise him upon the
      strings and pipe.<BR>
      5 Praise him upon the well-tuned cymbals: * praise him upon the
      loud cymbals.<BR>
      6 Let every thing that hath breath * praise the LORD.
