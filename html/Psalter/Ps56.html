      <P><B>Psalm 56. Miserere mei, Deus.</B><BR>
      BE merciful unto me, O God, for man goeth about to devour me;
      * he is daily fighting, and troubling me.<BR>
      2 Mine enemies are daily at hand to swallow me up; * for they
      be many that fight against me, O thou Most Highest.<BR>
      3 Nevertheless, though I am sometime afraid, * yet put I my trust
      in thee.<BR>
      4 I will praise God, because of his word: * I have put my trust
      in God, and will not fear what flesh can do unto me.<BR>
      5 They daily mistake my words; * all that they imagine is to
      do me evil.<BR>
      6 They hold all together, and keep themselves close, * and mark
      my steps, when they lay wait for my soul.<BR>
      7 Shall they escape for their wickedness? * thou, O God, in thy
      displeasure shalt cast them down.<BR>
      8 Thou tellest my wanderings; put my tears into thy bottle: *
      are not these things noted in thy book?<BR>
      9 Whensoever I call upon thee, then shall mine enemies be put
      to flight: * this I know; for God is on my side.<BR>
      10 In God's word will I rejoice; * in the LORD'S word will I
      comfort me.<BR>
      11 Yea, in God have I put my trust; * I will not be afraid what
      man can do unto me.<BR>
      12 Unto thee, O God, will I pay my vows; * unto thee will I give
      thanks.<BR>
      13 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, and my feet from
      falling, * that I may walk before God in the light of the living.
