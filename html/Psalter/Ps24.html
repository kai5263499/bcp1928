      <P><B>Psalms 24. Domini est terra.</B><BR>
      THE earth is the LORD'S, and all that therein is; * the compass
      of the world, and they that dwell therein.<BR>
      2 For he hath founded it upon the seas, * and stablished it upon
      the floods.<BR>
      3 Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? * or who shall
      rise up in his holy place?<BR>
      4 Even he that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; * and that
      hath not lift up his mind unto vanity, nor sworn to deceive his
      neighbour.<BR>
      5 He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, * and righteousness
      from the God of his salvation.<BR>
      6 This is the generation of them that seek him; * even of them
      that seek thy face, O God of Jacob.<BR>
      7 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting
      doors; * and the King of glory shall come in.<BR>
      8 Who is this King of glory? * It is the LORD strong and mighty,
      even the LORD mighty in battle.<BR>
      9 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting
      doors; * and the King of glory shall come in.<BR>
      10 Who is this King of glory? * Even the LORD of hosts, he is
      the King of glory.
