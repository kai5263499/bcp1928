    <p><strong>Psalm 37. Noli aemulari.</strong><br />
      FRET not thyself because of the ungodly; * neither be thou envious against the evil doers.<br />
      2 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, * and be withered even as the green herb.<br />
      3 Put thou thy trust in the LORD, and be doing good; * dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.<br />
      4 Delight thou in the LORD, * and he shall give thee thy heart's desire.<br />
      5 Commit thy way unto the LORD, and put thy trust in him, * and he shall bring it to pass.<br />
      6 He shall make thy righteousness as clear as the light, * and thy just dealing as the noon-day.<br />
      7 Hold thee still in the LORD, and abide patiently upon him: * but grieve not thyself at him whose way doth prosper, against the man that doeth after evil counsels.<br />
      8 Leave off from wrath, and let go displeasure: * fret not thyself, else shalt thou be moved to do evil.<br />
      9 Wicked doers shall be rooted out; * and they that patiently abide the LORD, those shall inherit the land.<br />
      10 Yet a little while, and the ungodly shall be clean gone: * thou shalt look after his place, and he shall be away.<br />
      11 But the meek-spirited shall possess the earth, * and shall be refreshed in the multitude of peace.<br />
      12 The ungodly seeketh counsel against the just, * and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.<br />
      13 The Lord shall laugh him to-scorn; * for he hath seen that his day is coming.<br />
      14 The ungodly have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, * to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be upright in their ways.<br />
      15 Their sword shall go through their own heart, * and their bow shall be broken.<br />
      16 A small thing that the righteous hath, * is better than great riches of the ungodly.<br />
      17 For the arms of the ungodly shall be broken, * and the LORD upholdeth the righteous.<br />
      18 The LORD knoweth the days of the godly; * and their inheritance shall endure for ever.<br />
      19 They shall not be confounded in the perilous time; * and in the days of dearth they shall have enough.<br />
      20 As for the ungodly, they shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall consume as the fat of lambs: * yea, even as the smoke shall they consume away.<br />
      21 The ungodly borroweth, and payeth not again; * but the righteous is merciful and liberal.<br />
      22 Such as are blessed of God, shall possess the land; * and they that are cursed of him, shall be rooted out.<br />
      23 The LORD ordereth a good man's going, * and maketh his way acceptable to himself.<br />
      24 Though he fall, he shall not be cast away; * for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand.<br />
      25 I have been young, and now am old; * and yet saw I never the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging their bread.<br />
      26 The righteous is ever merciful, and lendeth; * and his seed is blessed.<br />
      27 Flee from evil, and do the thing that is good; * and dwell for evermore.<br />
      28 For the LORD loveth the thing that is right; * he forsaketh not his that be godly, but they are preserved for ever.<br />
      29 The unrighteous shall be punished; * as for the seed of the ungodly, it shall be rooted out.<br />
      30 The righteous shall inherit the land, * and dwell therein for ever.<br />
      31 The mouth of the righteous is exercised in wisdom, * and his tongue will be talking of judgment.<br />
      32 The law of his God is in his heart, * and his goings shall not slide.<br />
      33 The ungodly watcheth the righteous, * and seeketh occasion to slay him.<br />
      34 The LORD will not leave him in his hand, * nor condemn him when he is judged.<br />
      35 Hope thou in the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall promote thee, that thou shalt possess the land: * when the ungodly shall perish, thou shalt see it.<br />
      36 I myself have seen the ungodly in great power, * and flourishing like a green bay-tree.<br />
      37 I went by, and lo, he was gone: * I sought him, but his place could no where be found.<br />
      38 Keep innocency, and take heed unto the thing that is right; * for that shall bring a man peace at the last.<br />
      39 As for the transgressors, they shall perish together; * and the end of the ungodly is, they shall be rooted out at the last.<br />
      40 But the salvation of the righteous cometh of the LORD; * who is also their strength in the time of trouble.<br />
      41 And the LORD shall stand by them, and save them: * he shall deliver them from the ungodly, and shall save them, because they put their trust in him. </p>
