      <P><B>Psalm 145. Exaltabo te, Deus.</B><BR>
      I WILL magnify thee, O God, my King; * and I will praise thy
      Name for ever and ever.<BR>
      2 Every day will I give thanks unto thee; * and praise thy Name
      for ever and ever.<BR>
      3 Great is the LORD, and marvellous worthy to be praised; * there
      is no end of his greatness.<BR>
      4 One generation shall praise thy works unto another, * and declare
      thy power.<BR>
      5 As for me, I will be talking of thy worship, * thy glory, thy
      praise, and wondrous works;<BR>
      6 So that men shall speak of the might of thy marvellous acts;
      * and I will also tell of thy greatness.<BR>
      7 The memorial of thine abundant kindness shall be showed; *
      and men shall sing of thy righteousness.<BR>
      8 The LORD is gracious and merciful; * long-suffering, and of
      great goodness.<BR>
      9 The LORD is loving unto every man; * and his mercy is over
      all his works.<BR>
      10 All thy works praise thee, O LORD; * and thy saints give thanks
      unto thee.<BR>
      11 They show the glory of thy kingdom, * and talk of thy power;<BR>
      12 That thy power, thy glory, and mightiness of thy kingdom,
      * might be known unto men.<BR>
      13 Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, * and thy dominion
      endureth throughout all ages.<BR>
      14 The LORD upholdeth all such as fall, * and lifteth up all
      those that are down.<BR>
      15 The eyes of all wait upon thee, O Lord; * and thou givest
      them their meat in due season.<BR>
      16 Thou openest thine hand, * and fillest all things living with
      plenteousness.<BR>
      17 The LORD is righteous in all his ways, * and holy in all his
      works.<BR>
      18 The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him; * yea,
      all such as call upon him faithfully.<BR>
      19 He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him; * he also
      will hear their cry, and will help them.<BR>
      20 The LORD preserveth all them that love him; * but scattereth
      abroad all the ungodly.<BR>
      21 My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD; * and let all
      flesh give thanks unto his holy Name for ever and ever.
