      <P><B>Psalms 10. Ut quid, Domine ?</B><BR>
      WHY standest thou so far off, O LORD, * and hidest thy face in
      the needful time of trouble?<BR>
      2 The ungodly, for his own lust, doth persecute the poor: * let
      them be taken in the crafty wiliness that they have imagined.<BR>
      3 For the ungodly hath made boast of his own heart's desire,
      * and speaketh good of the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.<BR>
      4 The ungodly is so proud, that he careth not for God, * neither
      is God in all his thoughts.<BR>
      5 His ways are alway grievous; * thy judgments are far above
      out of his sight, and therefore defieth he all his enemies.<BR>
      6 For he hath said in his heart, Tush, I shall never be cast
      down, * there shall no harm happen unto me.<BR>
      7 His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and fraud; * under his
      tongue is ungodliness and vanity.<BR>
      8 He sitteth lurking in the thievish corners of the streets,
      * and privily in his lurking dens doth he murder the innocent;
      his eyes are set against the poor.<BR>
      9 For he lieth waiting secretly; even as a lion lurketh he in
      his den, * that he may ravish the poor.<BR>
      10 He doth ravish the poor, * when he getteth him into his net.<BR>
      11 He falleth down, and humbleth himself, * that the congregation
      of the poor may fall into the hands of his captains.<BR>
      12 He hath said in his heart, Tush, God hath forgotten; * he
      hideth away his face, and he will never see it.<BR>
      13 Arise, O LORD God, and lift up thine hand; * forget not the
      poor.<BR>
      14 Wherefore should the wicked blaspheme God, * while he doth
      say in his heart, Tush, thou God carest not for it?<BR>
      15 Surely thou hast seen it; * for thou beholdest ungodliness
      and wrong, that thou mayest take the matter into thy hand.<BR>
      16 The poor committeth himself unto thee; * for thou art the
      helper of the friendless.<BR>
      17 Break thou the power of the ungodly and malicious; * search
      out his ungodliness, until thou find none.<BR>
      18 The LORD is King for ever and ever, * and the heathen are
      perished out of the land.<BR>
      19 LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the poor; * thou preparest
      their heart, and thine ear hearkeneth;<BR>
      20 To help the fatherless and poor unto their right, * that the
      man of the earth be no more exalted against them.
