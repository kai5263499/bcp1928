      The Eighth Day.<BR>
<BR>
      Morning Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 38. Domine, ne in furore.</B><BR>
      PUT me not to rebuke, O LORD, in thine anger; * neither chasten
      me in thy heavy displeasure:<BR>
      2 For thine arrows stick fast in me, * and thy hand presseth
      me sore.<BR>
      3 There is no health in my flesh, because of thy displeasure;
      * neither is there any rest in my bones, by reason of my sin.<BR>
      4 For my wickednesses are gone over my head, * and are like a
      sore burden, too heavy for me to bear.<BR>
      5 My wounds stink, and are corrupt, * through my foolishness.<BR>
      6 I am brought into so great trouble and misery, * that I go
      mourning all the day long.<BR>
      7 For my loins are filled with a sore disease, * and there is
      no whole part in my body.<BR>
      8 I am feeble and sore smitten; * I have roared for the very
      disquietness of my heart.<BR>
      9 Lord, thou knowest all my desire; * and my groaning is not
      hid from thee.<BR>
      10 My heart panteth, my strength hath failed me, * and the light
      of mine eyes is gone from me.<BR>
      11 My lovers and my neighbours did stand looking upon my trouble,
      * and my kinsmen stood afar off.<BR>
      12 They also that sought after my life laid snares for me; *
      and they that went about to do me evil talked of wickedness,
      and imagined deceit all the day long.<BR>
      13 As for me, I was like a deaf man, and heard not; * and as
      one that is dumb, who doth not open his mouth.<BR>
      14 I became even as a man that heareth not, * and in whose mouth
      are no reproofs.<BR>
      15 For in thee, O LORD, have I put my trust; * thou shalt answer
      for me, O Lord my God.<BR>
      16 I have required that they, even mine enemies, should not triumph
      over me; * for when my foot slipt, they rejoiced greatly against
      me.<BR>
      17 And I truly am set in the plague, * and my heaviness is ever
      in my sight.<BR>
      18 For I will confess my wickedness, * and be sorry for my sin.<BR>
      19 But mine enemies live, and are mighty; * and they that hate
      me wrongfully are many in number.<BR>
      20 They also that reward evil for good are against me; * because
      I follow the thing that good is.<BR>
      21 Forsake me not, O LORD my God; * be not thou far from me.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 39. Dixi, Custodiam.</B><BR>
      I SAID, I will take heed to my ways, * that I offend not in my
      tongue<BR>
      2 I will keep my mouth as it were with a bridle, * while the
      ungodly is in my sight.<BR>
      3 I held my tongue, and spake nothing: * I kept silence, yea,
      even from good words; but it was pain and grief to me.<BR>
      4 My heart was hot within me: and while I was thus musing the
      fire kindled, * and at the last I spake with my tongue:<BR>
      5 LORD, let me know mine end, and the number of my days; * that
      I may be certified how long I have to live.<BR>
      6 Behold, thou hast made my days as it were a span long, and
      mine age is even as nothing in respect of thee; * and verily
      every man living is altogether vanity.<BR>
      7 For man walketh in a vain shadow, and disquieteth himself in
      vain; * he heapeth up riches, and cannot tell who shall gather
      them.<BR>
      8 And now, Lord, what is my hope? * truly my hope is even in
      thee.<BR>
      9 Deliver me from all mine offences; * and make me not a rebuke
      unto the foolish.<BR>
      10 I became dumb, and opened not my mouth; * for it was thy doing.<BR>
      11 Take thy plague away from me: * I am even consumed by the
      means of thy heavy hand.<BR>
      12 When thou with rebukes dost chasten man for sin, thou makest
      his beauty to consume away, like as it were a moth fretting a
      garment: * every man therefore is but vanity.<BR>
      13 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and with thine ears consider my calling;
      * hold not thy peace at my tears;<BR>
      14 For I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, * as all my
      fathers were.<BR>
      15 O spare me a little, that I may recover my strength, * before
      I go hence, and be no more seen.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 40. Expectans expectavi.</B><BR>
      I WAITED patiently for the LORD, * and he inclined unto me, and
      heard my calling.<BR>
      2 He brought me also out of the horrible pit, out of the mire
      and clay, * and set my feet upon the rock, and ordered my goings.<BR>
      3 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, * even a thanksgiving
      unto our God.<BR>
      4 Many shall see it, and fear, * and shall put their trust in
      the LORD.<BR>
      5 Blessed is the man that hath set his hope in the LORD, * and
      turned not unto the proud, and to such as go about with lies.<BR>
      6 O LORD my God, great are the wondrous works which thou hast
      done, like as be also thy thoughts, which are to us-ward; * and
      yet there is no man that ordereth them unto thee.<BR>
      7 If I should declare them, and speak of them, * they should
      be more than I am able to express.<BR>
      8 Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, * but mine ears hast
      thou opened.<BR>
      9 Burnt-offering and sacrifice for sin hast thou not required:
      * then said I, LO, I come;<BR>
      10 In the volume of the book it is written of me, that I should
      fulfil thy will, O my God: * I am content to do it; yea, thy
      law is within my heart.<BR>
      11 I have declared thy righteousness in the great congregation:
      * lo, I will not refrain my lips, O LORD, and that thou knowest.<BR>
      12 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; * my talk
      hath been of thy truth, and of thy salvation.<BR>
      13 I have not kept back thy loving mercy and truth * from the
      great congregation.<BR>
      14 Withdraw not thou thy mercy from me, O LORD; * let thy loving-kindness
      and thy truth alway preserve me.<BR>
      15 For innumerable troubles are come about me; my sins have taken
      such hold upon me, that I am not able to look up; * yea, they
      are more in number than the hairs of my head, and my heart hath
      failed me.<BR>
      16 O LORD, let it be thy pleasure to deliver me; * make haste,
      O LORD, to help me.<BR>
      17 Let them be ashamed, and confounded together, that seek after
      my soul to destroy it; * let them be driven backward, and put
      to rebuke, that wish me evil.<BR>
      18 Let them be desolate, and rewarded with shame, * that say
      unto me, Fie upon thee! fie upon thee!<BR>
      19 Let all those that seek thee, be joyful and glad in thee;
      * and let such as love thy salvation, say alway, The LORD be
      praised.<BR>
      20 As for me, I am poor and needy; * but the Lord careth for
      me.<BR>
      21 Thou art my helper and redeemer; * make no long tarrying,
      O my God.<BR>
      </P>

      <P><CENTER><A NAME="anchor495804"></A>Evening Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 41. Beatus qui intelligit.</B><BR>
      BLESSED is he that considereth the poor and needy; * the LORD
      shall deliver him in the time of trouble.<BR>
      2 The LORD preserve him, and keep him alive, that he may be blessed
      upon earth; * and deliver not thou him into the will of his enemies.<BR>
      3 The LORD comfort him when he lieth sick upon his bed; * make
      thou all his bed in his sickness.<BR>
      4 I said, LORD, be merciful unto me; * heal my soul, for I have
      sinned against thee.<BR>
      5 Mine enemies speak evil of me, * When shall he die, and his
      name perish?<BR>
      6 And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity, * and his heart
      conceiveth falsehood within himself; and when he cometh forth,
      he telleth it.<BR>
      7 All mine enemies whisper together against me; * even against
      me do they imagine this evil.<BR>
      8 An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him; * and now
      that he lieth, he shall rise up no more.<BR>
      9 Yea, even mine own familiar friend whom I trusted, * who did
      also eat of my bread, hath laid great wait for me.<BR>
      10 But be thou merciful unto me, O LORD; * raise thou me up again,
      and I shall reward them.<BR>
      11 By this I know thou favourest me, * that mine enemy doth not
      triumph against me.<BR>
      12 And in my innocency thou upholdest me, * and shalt set me
      before thy face for ever.<BR>
      13 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, * world without end. Amen.<BR>
<BR>
      <B>Psalm 42. Quemadmodum.</B><BR>
      LIKE as the hart desireth the water-brooks, * so longeth my soul
      after thee, O God.<BR>
      2 My soul is athirst for God, yea, even for the living God: *
      when shall I come to appear before the presence of God?<BR>
      3 My tears have been my meat day and night, * while they daily
      say unto me, Where is now thy God?<BR>
      4 Now when I think thereupon, I pour out my heart by myself;
      * for I went with the multitude, and brought them forth into
      the house of God;<BR>
      5 In the voice of praise and thanksgiving, * among such as keep
      holy-day.<BR>
      6 Why art thou so full of heaviness, O my soul? * and why art
      thou so disquieted within me?<BR>
      7 O put thy trust in God; * for I will yet thank him, which is
      the help of my countenance, and my God.<BR>
      8 My soul is vexed within me; * therefore will I remember thee
      from the land of Jordan, from Hermon and the little hill.<BR>
      9 One deep calleth another, because of the noise of thy water-floods;
      * all thy waves and storms are gone over me.<BR>
      10 The LORD will grant his loving-kindness in the daytime; *
      and in the night season will I sing of him, and make my prayer
      unto the God of my life.<BR>
      11 I will say unto the God of my strength, Why hast thou forgotten
      me? * why go I thus heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?<BR>
      12 My bones are smitten asunder as with a sword, * while mine
      enemies that trouble me cast me in the teeth;<BR>
      13 Namely, while they say daily unto me, * Where is now thy God?<BR>
      14 Why art thou so vexed, O my soul? * and why art thou so disquieted
      within me?<BR>
      15 O put thy trust in God; * for I will yet thank him, which
      is the help of my countenance, and my God.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 43. Judica me, Deus.</B><BR>
      GIVE sentence with me, O God, and defend my cause against the
      ungodly people; * O deliver me from the deceitful and wicked
      man.<BR>
      2 For thou art the God of my strength; why hast thou put me from
      thee? * and why go I so heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?<BR>
      3 O send out thy light and thy truth, that they may lead me,
      * and bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy dwelling;<BR>
      4 And that I may go unto the altar of God, even unto the God
      of my joy and gladness; * and upon the harp will I give thanks
      unto thee, O God, my God.<BR>
      5 Why art thou so heavy, O my soul? * and why art thou so disquieted
      within me?<BR>
      6 O put thy trust in God; * for I will yet give him thanks, which
      is the help of my countenance, and my God.</P>
