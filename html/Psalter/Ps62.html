      <P><B>Psalm 62. Nonne Deo?</B><BR>
      MY soul truly waiteth still upon God; * for of him cometh my
      salvation.<BR>
      2 He verily is my strength and my salvation; * he is my defence,
      so that I shall not greatly fall.<BR>
      3 How long will ye imagine mischief against every man? * Ye shall
      be slain all the sort of you; yea, as a tottering wall shall
      ye be, and like a broken hedge.<BR>
      4 Their device is only how to put him out whom God will exalt;
      * their delight is in lies; they give good words with their mouth,
      but curse with their heart.<BR>
      5 Nevertheless, my soul, wait thou still upon God; * for my hope
      is in him.<BR>
      6 He truly is my strength and my salvation; * he is my defence,
      so that I shall not fall.<BR>
      7 In God is my health and my glory; * the rock of my might; and
      in God is my trust.<BR>
      8 O put your trust in him alway, ye people; * pour out your hearts
      before him, for God is our hope.<BR>
      9 As for the children of men, they are but vanity; the children
      of men are deceitful; * upon the weights they are altogether
      lighter than vanity itself.<BR>
      10 O trust not in wrong and robbery; give not yourselves unto
      vanity: * if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.<BR>
      11 God spake once, and twice I have also heard the same, * that
      power belongeth unto God;<BR>
      12 And that thou, Lord, art merciful; * for thou rewardest every
      man according to his work.
