      The Ninth Day.<BR>
<BR>
      Morning Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 44. Deus, auribus.</B><BR>
      WE have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us
      * what thou hast done in their time of old:<BR>
      2 How thou hast driven out the heathen with thy hand, and planted
      our fathers in; * how thou hast destroyed the nations, and made
      thy people to flourish.<BR>
      3 For they gat not the land in possession through their own sword,
      * neither was it their own arm that helped them;<BR>
      4 But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance;
      * because thou hadst a favour unto them.<BR>
      5 Thou art my King, O God; * send help unto Jacob.<BR>
      6 Through thee will we overthrow our enemies, * and in thy Name
      will we tread them under that rise up against us.<BR>
      7 For I will not trust in my bow, * it is not my sword that shall
      help me;<BR>
      8 But it is thou that savest us from our enemies, * and puttest
      them to confusion that hate us.<BR>
      9 We make our boast of God all day long, * and will praise thy
      Name for ever.<BR>
      10 But now thou art far off, and puttest us to confusion, * and
      goest not forth with our armies.<BR>
      11 Thou makest us to turn our backs upon our enemies, * so that
      they which hate us spoil our goods.<BR>
      12 Thou lettest us be eaten up like sheep, * and hast scattered
      us among the heathen.<BR>
      13 Thou sellest thy people for nought, * and takest no money
      for them.<BR>
      14 Thou makest us to be rebuked of our neighbours, * to be laughed
      to scorn, and had in derision of them that are round about us.<BR>
      15 Thou makest us to be a by-word among the nations, * and that
      the peoples shake their heads at us.<BR>
      16 My confusion is daily before me, * and the shame of my face
      hath covered me;<BR>
      17 For the voice of the slanderer and blasphemer, * for the enemy
      and avenger.<BR>
      18 And though all this be come upon us, yet do we not forget
      thee, * nor behave ourselves frowardly in thy covenant.<BR>
      19 Our heart is not turned back, * neither our steps gone out
      of thy way;<BR>
      20 No, not when thou hast smitten us into the place of dragons,
      * and covered us with the shadow of death.<BR>
      21 If we have forgotten the Name of our God, and holden up our
      hands to any strange god, * shall not God search it out? for
      he knoweth the very secrets of the heart.<BR>
      22 For thy sake also are we killed all the day long, * and are
      counted as sheep appointed to be slain.<BR>
      23 Up, Lord, why sleepest thou? * awake, and be not absent from
      us for ever.<BR>
      24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, * and forgettest our misery
      and trouble?<BR>
      25 For our soul is brought low, even unto the dust; * our belly
      cleaveth unto the ground.<BR>
      26 Arise, and help us, * and deliver us, for thy mercy's sake.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 45. Eructavit cor meum.</B><BR>
      MY heart overfloweth with a good matter; I speak the things which
      I have made concerning the King. * My tongue is the pen of a
      ready writer.<BR>
      2 Thou art fairer than the children of men; * full of grace are
      thy lips, because God hath blessed thee for ever.<BR>
      3 Gird thee with thy sword upon thy thigh, O thou Most Mighty,
      * according to thy worship and renown.<BR>
      4 Good luck have thou with thine honour: * ride on, because of
      the word of truth, of meekness, and righteousness; and thy right
      hand shall teach thee terrible things.<BR>
      5 Thy arrows are very sharp in the heart of the King's enemies,
      * and the people shall be subdued unto thee.<BR>
      6 Thy seat, O God, endureth for ever; * the sceptre of thy kingdom
      is a right sceptre.<BR>
      7 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; * wherefore
      God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness
      above thy fellows.<BR>
      8 All thy garments smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia; * out of
      the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.<BR>
      9 Kings' daughters are among thy honourable women; * upon thy
      right hand doth stand the queen in a vesture of gold, wrought
      about with divers colours.<BR>
      10 Hearken, O daughter, and consider; incline thine ear; * forget
      also thine own people, and thy father's house.<BR>
      11 So shall the King have pleasure in thy beauty; * for he is
      thy Lord, and worship thou him.<BR>
      12 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; * like
      as the rich also among the people shall make their supplication
      before thee.<BR>
      13 The King's daughter is all glorious within; * her clothing
      is of wrought gold.<BR>
      14 She shall be brought unto the King in raiment of needlework:
      * the virgins that be her fellows shall bear her company, and
      shall be brought unto thee.<BR>
      15 With joy and gladness shall they be brought, * and shall enter
      into the King's palace.<BR>
      16 Instead of thy fathers, thou shalt have children, * whom thou
      mayest make princes in all lands.<BR>
      17 I will make thy Name to be remembered from one generation
      to another; * therefore shall the people give thanks unto thee,
      world without end.<BR>
      <B><BR>
<BR>
      Psalm 46. Deus noster refugium.</B><BR>
      GOD is our hope and strength, * a very present help in trouble.<BR>
      2 Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be moved, * and
      though the hills be carried into the midst of the sea;<BR>
      3 Though the waters thereof rage and swell, * and though the
      mountains shake at the tempest of the same.<BR>
      4 There is a river, the streams whereof make glad the city of
      God; * the holy place of the tabernacle of the Most Highest.<BR>
      5 God is in the midst of her, therefore shall she not be removed;
      * God shall help her, and that right early.<BR>
      6 The nations make much ado, and the kingdoms are moved; * but
      God hath showed his voice, and the earth shall melt away.<BR>
      7 The LORD of hosts is with us; * the God of Jacob is our refuge.<BR>
      8 O come hither, and behold the works of the LORD, * what destruction
      he hath brought upon the earth.<BR>
      9 He maketh wars to cease in all the world; * he breaketh the
      bow, and knappeth the spear in sunder, and burneth the chariots
      in the fire.<BR>
      10 Be still then, and know that I am God: * I will be exalted
      among the nations, and I will be exalted in the earth.<BR>
      11 The LORD of hosts is with us; * the God of Jacob is our refuge.<BR>

      <P><B>Psalm 47. Omnes gentes, plaudite.</B><BR>
      CLAP your hands together, all ye peoples: * O sing unto God with
      the voice of melody.<BR>
      2 For the LORD is high, and to be feared; * he is the great King
      upon all the earth.<BR>
      3 He shall subdue the peoples under us, * and the nations under
      our feet.<BR>
      4 He shall choose out an heritage for us, * even the excellency
      of Jacob, whom he loved.<BR>
      5 God is gone up with a merry noise, * and the LORD with the
      sound of the trump.<BR>
      6 O sing praises, sing praises unto our God; * O sing praises,
      sing praises unto our King.<BR>
      7 For God is the King of all the earth: * sing ye praises with
      understanding.<BR>
      8 God reigneth over the nations; * God sitteth upon his holy
      seat.<BR>
      9 The princes of the peoples are joined unto the people of the
      God of Abraham; * for God, which is very high exalted, doth defend
      the earth, as it were with a shield.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 48. Magnus Dominus.</B><BR>
      GREAT is the LORD, and highly to be praised * in the city of
      our God, even upon his holy hill.<BR>
      2 The hill of Sion is a fair place, and the joy of the whole
      earth; * upon the north side lieth the city of the great King:
      God is well known in her palaces as a sure refuge.<BR>
      3 For lo, the kings of the earth * were gathered, and gone by
      together.<BR>
      4 They marvelled to see such things; * they were astonished,
      and suddenly cast down.<BR>
      5 Fear came there upon them; and sorrow, * as upon a woman in
      her travail.<BR>
      6 Thou dost break the ships of the sea * through the east-wind.<BR>
      7 Like as we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD
      of hosts, in the city of our God; * God upholdeth the same for
      ever.<BR>
      8 We wait for thy loving-kindness, O God, * in the midst of thy
      temple.<BR>
      9 O God, according to thy Name, so is thy praise unto the world's
      end; * thy right hand is full of righteousness.<BR>
      10 Let the mount Sion rejoice, and the daughters of Judah be
      glad, * because of thy judgments.<BR>
      11 Walk about Sion, and go round about her; * and tell the towers
      thereof.<BR>
      12 Mark well her bulwarks, consider her palaces, * that ye may
      tell them that come after.<BR>
      13 For this God is our God for ever and ever: * he shall be our
      guide unto death.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 49. Audite haec, omnes.</B><BR>
      O HEAR ye this, all ye people; * ponder it with your ears, all
      ye that dwell in the world;<BR>
      2 High and low, rich and poor, * one with another.<BR>
      3 My mouth shall speak of wisdom, * and my heart shall muse of
      understanding.<BR>
      4 I will incline mine ear to the parable, * and show my dark
      speech upon the harp.<BR>
      5 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, * when wickedness
      at my heels compasseth me round about?<BR>
      6 There be some that put their trust in their goods, * and boast
      themselves in the multitude of their riches.<BR>
      7 But no man may deliver his brother, * nor give a ransom unto
      God for him,<BR>
      8 (For it cost more to redeem their souls, * so that he must
      let that alone for ever;)<BR>
      9 That he shall live alway, * and not see the grave.<BR>
      10 For he seeth that wise men also die and perish together, *
      as well as the ignorant and foolish, and leave their riches for
      other.<BR>
      11 And yet they think that their houses shall continue for ever,
      and that their dwelling-places shall endure from one generation
      to another; * and call the lands after their own names.<BR>
      12 Nevertheless, man being in honour abideth not, * seeing he
      may be compared unto the beasts that perish;<BR>
      13 This their way is very foolishness; * yet their posterity
      praise their saying.<BR>
      14 They lie in the grave like sheep; death is their shepherd;
      and the righteous shall have dominion over them in the morning:
      * their beauty shall consume in the sepulchre, and have no abiding.<BR>
      15 But God hath delivered my soul from the power of the grave;
      * for he shall receive me.<BR>
      16 Be not thou afraid, though one be made rich, * or if the glory
      of his house be increased;<BR>
      17 For he shall carry nothing away with him when he dieth, *
      neither shall his pomp follow him.<BR>
      18 For while he lived, he counted himself an happy man; * and
      so long as thou doest well unto thyself, men will speak good
      of thee.<BR>
      19 He shall follow the generation of his fathers, * and shall
      never see light.<BR>
      20 Man that is in honour but hath no understanding * is compared
      unto the beasts that perish.</P>
