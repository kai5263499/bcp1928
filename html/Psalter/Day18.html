      The Eighteenth Day.<BR>
<BR>
      Morning Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 90. Domine, refugium.</B><BR>
      LORD, thou hast been our refuge, * from one generation to another.<BR>
      2 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth
      and the world were made, * thou art God from everlasting, and
      world without end.<BR>
      3 Thou turnest man to destruction; * again thou sayest, Come
      again, ye children of men.<BR>
      4 For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when
      it is past, * and as a watch in the night.<BR>
      5 As soon as thou scatterest them they are even as a sleep; *
      and fade away suddenly like the grass.<BR>
      6 In the morning it is green, and groweth up; * but in the evening
      it is cut down, dried up, and withered.<BR>
      7 For we consume away in thy displeasure, * and are afraid at
      thy wrathful indignation.<BR>
      8 Thou hast set our misdeeds before thee; * and our secret sins
      in the light of thy countenance.<BR>
      9 For when thou art angry all our days are gone: * we bring our
      years to an end, as it were a tale that is told.<BR>
      10 The days of our age are threescore years and ten; and though
      men be so strong that they come to fourscore years, * yet is
      their strength then but labour and sorrow; so soon passeth it
      away, and we are gone.<BR>
      11 But who regardeth the power of thy wrath? * or feareth aright
      thy indignation?<BR>
      12 So teach us to number our days, * that we may apply our hearts
      unto wisdom.<BR>
      13 Turn thee again, O LORD, at the last, * and be gracious unto
      thy servants.<BR>
      14 O satisfy us with thy mercy, and that soon: * so shall we
      rejoice and be glad all the days of our life.<BR>
      15 Comfort us again now after the time that thou hast plagued
      us; * and for the years wherein we have suffered adversity.<BR>
      16 Show thy servants thy work, * and their children thy glory.<BR>
      17 And the glorious majesty of the LORD our God be upon us: *
      prosper thou the work of our hands upon us; O prosper thou our
      handy-work.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 91. Qui habitat.</B><BR>
      WHOSO dwelleth under the defence of the Most High, * shall abide
      under the shadow of the Almighty.<BR>
      2 I will say unto the LORD, Thou art my hope, and my stronghold;
      * my God, in him will I trust.<BR>
      3 For he shall deliver thee from the snare of the hunter, * and
      from the noisome pestilence.<BR>
      4 He shall defend thee under his wings, and thou shalt be safe
      under his feathers; * his faithfulness and truth shall be thy
      shield and buckler.<BR>
      5 Thou shalt not be afraid for any terror by night, * nor for
      the arrow that flieth by day;<BR>
      6 For the pestilence that walketh in darkness, * nor for the
      sickness that destroyeth in the noon-day.<BR>
      7 A thousand shall fall beside thee, and ten thousand at thy
      right hand; * but it shall not come nigh thee.<BR>
      8 Yea, with thine eyes shalt thou behold, * and see the reward
      of the ungodly.<BR>
      9 For thou, LORD, art my hope; * thou hast set thine house of
      defence very high.<BR>
      10 There shall no evil happen unto thee, * neither shall any
      plague come nigh thy dwelling.<BR>
      11 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, * to keep thee
      in all thy ways.<BR>
      12 They shall bear thee in their hands, * that thou hurt not
      thy foot against a stone.<BR>
      13 Thou shalt go upon the lion and adder: * the young lion and
      the dragon shalt thou tread under thy feet.<BR>
      14 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver
      him; * I will set him up, because he hath known my Name.<BR>
      15 He shall call upon me, and I will hear him; * yea, I am with
      him in trouble; I will deliver him, and bring him to honour.<BR>
      16 With long life will I satisfy him, * and show him my salvation.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 92. Bonum est confiteri.</B><BR>
      IT is a good thing to give thanks unto the LORD, * and to sing
      praises unto thy Name, O Most Highest;<BR>
      2 To tell of thy loving-kindness early in the morning, * and
      of thy truth in the night season;<BR>
      3 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the lute; * upon
      a loud instrument, and upon the harp.<BR>
      4 For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy works; * and
      I will rejoice in giving praise for the operations of thy hands.<BR>
      5 O LORD, how glorious are thy works! * thy thoughts are very
      deep.<BR>
      6 An unwise man doth not well consider this, * and a fool doth
      not understand it.<BR>
      7 When the ungodly are green as the grass, and when all the workers
      of wickedness do flourish, * then shall they be destroyed for
      ever; but thou, LORD, art the Most Highest for evermore.<BR>
      8 For lo, thine enemies, O LORD, lo, thine enemies shall perish;
      * and all the workers of wickedness shall be destroyed.<BR>
      9 But my horn shall be exalted like the horn of an unicorn; *
      for I am anointed with fresh oil.<BR>
      10 Mine eye also shall see his lust of mine enemies, * and mine
      ear shall hear his desire of the wicked that arise up against
      me.<BR>
      11 The righteous shall flourish like a palm-tree, * and shall
      spread abroad like a cedar in Lebanon.<BR>
      12 Such as are planted in the house of the LORD, * shall flourish
      in the courts of the house of our God.<BR>
      13 They also shall bring forth more fruit in their age, * and
      shall be fat and well-liking;<BR>
      14 That they may show how true the LORD my strength is, * and
      that there is no unrighteousness in him.<BR>

      <P><CENTER><A NAME="anchor453745"></A>Evening Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 93. Dominus regnavit.</B><BR>
      THE LORD is King, and hath put on glorious apparel; * the LORD
      hath put on his apparel, and girded himself with strength.<BR>
      2 He hath made the round world so sure, * that it cannot be moved.<BR>
      3 Ever since the world began, hath thy seat been prepared: *
      thou art from everlasting.<BR>
      4 The floods are risen, O LORD, the floods have lift up their
      voice; * the floods lift up their waves.<BR>
      5 The waves of the sea are mighty, and rage horribly; * but yet
      the LORD, who dwelleth on high, is mightier.<BR>
      6 Thy testimonies, O LORD, are very sure: * holiness becometh
      thine house for ever.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 94. Deus ultionum.</B><BR>
      O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth, * thou God, to whom
      vengeance belongeth, show thyself.<BR>
      2 Arise, thou Judge of the world, * and reward the proud after
      their deserving.<BR>
      3 LORD, how long shall the ungodly, * how long shall the ungodly
      triumph?<BR>
      4 How long shall all wicked doers speak so disdainfully, * and
      make such proud boasting?<BR>
      5 They smite down thy people, O LORD, * and trouble thine heritage.<BR>
      6 They murder the widow and the stranger, * and put the fatherless
      to death.<BR>
      7 And yet they say, Tush, the LORD shall not see, * neither shall
      the God of Jacob regard it.<BR>
      8 Take heed, ye unwise among the people: * O ye fools, when will
      ye understand?<BR>
      9 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? * or he that made
      the eye, shall he not see?<BR>
      10 Or he that instructeth the heathen, * it is he that teacheth
      man knowledge; shall not he punish?<BR>
      11 The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, * that they are but
      vain.<BR>
      12 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, * and teachest
      him in thy law;<BR>
      13 That thou mayest give him patience in time of adversity, *
      until the pit be digged up for the ungodly.<BR>
      14 For the LORD will not fail his people; * neither will he forsake
      his inheritance;<BR>
      15 Until righteousness turn again unto judgment: * all such as
      are true in heart shall follow it.<BR>
      16 Who will rise up with me against the wicked? * or who will
      take my part against the evil doers?<BR>
      17 If the LORD had not helped me, * it had not failed, but my
      soul had been put to silence.<BR>
      18 But when I said, My foot hath slipt; * thy mercy, O LORD,
      held me up.<BR>
      19 In the multitude of the sorrows that I had in my heart, *
      thy comforts have refreshed my soul.<BR>
      20 Wilt thou have any thing to do with the throne of wickedness,
      * which imagineth mischief as a law?<BR>
      21 They gather them together against the soul of the righteous,
      * and condemn the innocent blood.<BR>
      22 But the LORD is my refuge, * and my God is the strength of
      my confidence.<BR>
      23 He shall recompense them their wickedness, and destroy them
      in their own malice; * yea, the LORD our God shall destroy them.<BR>
