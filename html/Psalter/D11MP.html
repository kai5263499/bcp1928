    <p><strong>Psalm 56. Miserere mei, Deus.</strong><br />
      BE merciful unto me, O God, for man goeth about to devour me; * he is daily fighting, and troubling me.<br />
      2 Mine enemies are daily at hand to swallow me up; * for they be many that fight against me, O thou Most Highest.<br />
      3 Nevertheless, though I am sometime afraid, * yet put I my trust in thee.<br />
      4 I will praise God, because of his word: * I have put my trust in God, and will not fear what flesh can do unto me.<br />
      5 They daily mistake my words; * all that they imagine is to do me evil.<br />
      6 They hold all together, and keep themselves close, * and mark my steps, when they lay wait for my soul.<br />
      7 Shall they escape for their wickedness? * thou, O God, in thy displeasure shalt cast them down.<br />
      8 Thou tellest my wanderings; put my tears into thy bottle: * are not these things noted in thy book?<br />
      9 Whensoever I call upon thee, then shall mine enemies be put to flight: * this I know; for God is on my side.<br />
      10 In God's word will I rejoice; * in the LORD'S word will I comfort me.<br />
      11 Yea, in God have I put my trust; * I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.<br />
      12 Unto thee, O God, will I pay my vows; * unto thee will I give thanks.<br />
      13 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, and my feet from falling, * that I may walk before God in the light of the living.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 57. Miserere mei, Deus.</strong><br />
      BE merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me; for my soul trusteth in thee; * and under the shadow of thy wings shall be my refuge, until this tyranny be overpast.<br />
      2 I will call unto the Most High God, * even unto the God that shall perform the cause which I have in hand.<br />
      3 He shall send from heaven, * and save me from the reproof of him that would eat me up.<br />
      4 God shall send forth his mercy and truth: * my soul is among lions;<br />
      5 And I lie even among the children of men, that are set on fire, * whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.<br />
      6 Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens; * and thy glory above all the earth.<br />
      7 They have laid a net for my feet, and pressed down my soul; * they have digged a pit before me, and are fallen into the midst of it themselves.<br />
      8 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed; * I will sing and give praise.<br />
      9 Awake up, my glory; awake, lute and harp: * I myself will awake right early.<br />
      10 I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the peoples; * and I will sing unto thee among the nations.<br />
      11 For the greatness of thy mercy reacheth unto the heavens, * and thy truth unto the clouds.<br />
      12 Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens; * and thy glory above all the earth.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 58. Si vere utique.</strong><br />
      ARE your minds set upon righteousness, O ye congregation? * and do ye judge the thing that is right, O ye sons of men?<br />
      2 Yea, ye imagine mischief in your heart upon the earth, * and your hands deal with wickedness.<br />
      3 The ungodly are froward, even from their mother's womb; * as soon as they are born, they go astray, and speak lies.<br />
      4 They are as venomous as the poison of a serpent, * even like the deaf adder, that stoppeth her ears;<br />
      5 Which refuseth to hear the voice of the charmer, * charm he never so wisely.<br />
      6 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouths; * smite the jaw-bones of the lions, O LORD.<br />
      7 Let them fall away like water that runneth apace; * when they shoot their arrows, let them be rooted out.<br />
      8 Let them consume away like a snail, and be like the untimely fruit of a woman; * and let them not see the sun.<br />
      9 Or ever your pots be made hot with thorns, * he shall take them away with a whirlwind, the green and the burning alike.<br />
      10 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance; * he shall wash his footsteps in the blood of the ungodly.<br />
    11 So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous; * doubtless there is a God that judgeth the earth.
