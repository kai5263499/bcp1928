      <P><B>Psalm 109. Deus, laudem.</B><BR>
      HOLD not thy tongue, O God of my praise; * for the mouth of the
      ungodly, yea, the mouth of the deceitful is opened upon me.<BR>
      2 And they have spoken against me with false tongues; * they
      compassed me about also with words of hatred, and fought against
      me without a cause.<BR>
      3 For the love that I had unto them, lo, they take now my contrary
      part; * but I give myself unto prayer.<BR>
      4 Thus have they rewarded me evil for good, * and hatred for
      my good will.<BR>
      5 Set thou an ungodly man to be ruler over him, * and let an
      adversary stand at his right hand.<BR>
      6 When sentence is given upon him, let him be condemned; * and
      let his prayer be turned into sin.<BR>
      7 Let his days be few; * and let another take his office.<BR>
      8 Let his children be fatherless, * and his wife a widow.<BR>
      9 Let his children be vagabonds, and beg their bread; * let them
      seek it also out of desolate places.<BR>
      10 Let the extortioner consume all that he hath; * and let the
      stranger spoil his labour.<BR>
      11 Let there be no man to pity him, * nor to have compassion
      upon his fatherless children.<BR>
      12 Let his posterity be destroyed; * and in the NEXT <!-- Start Superstats code version 7.0b.  Copyright 2008 MyComputer.com, Inc.

      let his name be clean put out.<BR>
      13 Let the wickedness of his fathers be had in remembrance in
      the sight of the LORD; * and let not the sin of his mother be
      done away.<BR>
      14 Let them alway be before the LORD, * that he may root out
      the memorial of them from off the earth;<BR>
      15 And that, because his mind was not to do good; * but persecuted
      the poor helpless man, that he might slay him that was vexed
      at the heart.<BR>
      16 His delight was in cursing, and it shall happen unto him;
      * he loved not blessing, therefore shall it be far from him.<BR>
      17 He clothed himself with cursing like as with a raiment, *
      and it shall come into his bowels like water, and like oil into
      his bones.<BR>
      18 Let it be unto him as the cloak that he hath upon him, * and
      as the girdle that he is alway girded withal.<BR>
      19 Let it thus happen from the LORD unto mine enemies, * and
      to those that speak evil against my soul.<BR>
      20 But deal thou with me, O LORD God, according unto thy Name;
      * for sweet is thy mercy.<BR>
      21 O deliver me, for I am helpless and poor, ~ and my heart is
      wounded within me.<BR>
      22 I go hence like the shadow that departeth, * and am driven
      away as the grasshopper.<BR>
      23 My knees are weak through fasting; * my flesh is dried up
      for want of fatness.<BR>
      24 I am become also a reproach unto them: * they that look upon
      me shake their heads.<BR>
      25 Help me, O LORD my God; * O save me according to thy mercy;<BR>
      26 And they shall know how that this is thy hand, * and that
      thou, LORD, hast done it.<BR>
      27 Though they curse, yet bless thou; * and let them be confounded
      that rise up against me; but let thy servant rejoice.<BR>
      28 Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame; * and let them
      cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a cloak.<BR>
      29 As for me, I will give great thanks unto the LORD with my
      mouth, * and praise him among the multitude;<BR>
      30 For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, * to save
      his soul from unrighteous judges.
