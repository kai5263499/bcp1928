      <P><B>Psalm 51. Miserere mei, Deus.</B><BR>
      HAVE mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness; * according
      to the multitude of thy mercies do away mine offences.<BR>
      2 Wash me throughly from my wickedness, * and cleanse me from
      my sin.<BR>
      3 For I acknowledge my faults, * and my sin is ever before me.<BR>
      4 Against thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy
      sight; * that thou mightest be justified in thy saying, and clear
      when thou shalt judge.<BR>
      5 Behold, I was shapen in wickedness, * and in sin hath my mother
      conceived me.<BR>
      6 But lo, thou requirest truth in the inward parts, * and shalt
      make me to understand wisdom secretly.<BR>
      7 Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; * thou
      shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.<BR>
      8 Thou shalt make me hear of joy and gladness, * that the bones
      which thou hast broken may rejoice.<BR>
      9 Turn thy face from my sins, * and put out all my misdeeds.<BR>
      10 Make me a clean heart, O God, * and renew a right spirit within
      me.<BR>
      11 Cast me not away from thy presence, * and take not thy holy
      Spirit from me.<BR>
      12 O give me the comfort of thy help again, * and stablish me
      with thy free Spirit.<BR>
      13 Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked, * and sinners
      shall be converted unto thee.<BR>
      14 Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou that art the
      God of my health; * and my tongue shall sing of thy righteousness.<BR>
      15 Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord, * and my mouth shall show
      thy praise.<BR>
      16 For thou desirest no sacrifice, else would I give it thee;
      * but thou delightest not in burnt-offerings.<BR>
      17 The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit: * a broken and
      contrite heart, O God, shalt thou not despise.<BR>
      18 O be favourable and gracious unto Sion; * build thou the walls
      of Jerusalem.<BR>
      19 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness,
      with the burnt-offerings and oblations; * then shall they offer
      young bullocks upon thine altar.
