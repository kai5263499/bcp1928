      <P><B>Psalms 27. Dominus illuminatio.</B><BR>
      THE LORD is my light and my salvation; whom then shall I fear?
      * the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom then shall I be
      afraid?<BR>
      2 When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me
      to eat up my flesh, * they stumbled and fell.<BR>
      3 Though an host of men were laid against me, yet shall not my
      heart be afraid; * and though there rose up war against me, yet
      will I put my trust in him.<BR>
      4 One thing have I desired of the LORD, which I will require;
      * even that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days
      of my life, to behold the fair beauty of the LORD, and to visit
      his temple.<BR>
      5 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his tabernacle;
      * yea, in the secret place of his dwelling shall he hide me,
      and set me up upon a rock of stone.<BR>
      6 And now shall he lift up mine head * above mine enemies round
      about me.<BR>
      7 Therefore will I offer in his dwelling an oblation, with great
      gladness: * I will sing and speak praises unto the LORD.<BR>
      8 Hearken unto my voice, O LORD, when I cry unto thee; * have
      mercy upon me, and hear me.<BR>
      9 My heart hath talked of thee, Seek ye my face: * Thy face,
      LORD, will I seek.<BR>
      10 O hide not thou thy face from me, * nor cast thy servant away
      in displeasure.<BR>
      11 Thou hast been my succour; * leave me not, neither forsake
      me, O God of my salvation.<BR>
      12 When my father and my mother forsake me, * the LORD taketh
      me up.<BR>
      13 Teach me thy way, O LORD, * and lead me in the right way,
      because of mine enemies.<BR>
      14 Deliver me not over into the will of mine adversaries: * for
      there are false witnesses risen up against me, and such as speak
      wrong.<BR>
      15 I should utterly have fainted, * but that I believe verily
      to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.<BR>
      16 O tarry thou the LORD'S leisure; * be strong, and he shall
      comfort thine heart; and put thou thy trust in the LORD.
