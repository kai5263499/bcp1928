    <p><strong>Psalm 47. Omnes gentes, plaudite.</strong><br />
      CLAP your hands together, all ye peoples: * O sing unto God with the voice of melody.<br />
      2 For the LORD is high, and to be feared; * he is the great King upon all the earth.<br />
      3 He shall subdue the peoples under us, * and the nations under our feet.<br />
      4 He shall choose out an heritage for us, * even the excellency of Jacob, whom he loved.<br />
      5 God is gone up with a merry noise, * and the LORD with the sound of the trump.<br />
      6 O sing praises, sing praises unto our God; * O sing praises, sing praises unto our King.<br />
      7 For God is the King of all the earth: * sing ye praises with understanding.<br />
      8 God reigneth over the nations; * God sitteth upon his holy seat.<br />
      9 The princes of the peoples are joined unto the people of the God of Abraham; * for God, which is very high exalted, doth defend the earth, as it were with a shield.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 48. Magnus Dominus.</strong><br />
      GREAT is the LORD, and highly to be praised * in the city of our God, even upon his holy hill.<br />
      2 The hill of Sion is a fair place, and the joy of the whole earth; * upon the north side lieth the city of the great King: God is well known in her palaces as a sure refuge.<br />
      3 For lo, the kings of the earth * were gathered, and gone by together.<br />
      4 They marvelled to see such things; * they were astonished, and suddenly cast down.<br />
      5 Fear came there upon them; and sorrow, * as upon a woman in her travail.<br />
      6 Thou dost break the ships of the sea * through the east-wind.<br />
      7 Like as we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God; * God upholdeth the same for ever.<br />
      8 We wait for thy loving-kindness, O God, * in the midst of thy temple.<br />
      9 O God, according to thy Name, so is thy praise unto the world's end; * thy right hand is full of righteousness.<br />
      10 Let the mount Sion rejoice, and the daughters of Judah be glad, * because of thy judgments.<br />
      11 Walk about Sion, and go round about her; * and tell the towers thereof.<br />
      12 Mark well her bulwarks, consider her palaces, * that ye may tell them that come after.<br />
      13 For this God is our God for ever and ever: * he shall be our guide unto death.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 49. Audite haec, omnes.</strong><br />
      O HEAR ye this, all ye people; * ponder it with your ears, all ye that dwell in the world;<br />
      2 High and low, rich and poor, * one with another.<br />
      3 My mouth shall speak of wisdom, * and my heart shall muse of understanding.<br />
      4 I will incline mine ear to the parable, * and show my dark speech upon the harp.<br />
      5 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, * when wickedness at my heels compasseth me round about?<br />
      6 There be some that put their trust in their goods, * and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches.<br />
      7 But no man may deliver his brother, * nor give a ransom unto God for him,<br />
      8 (For it cost more to redeem their souls, * so that he must let that alone for ever;)<br />
      9 That he shall live alway, * and not see the grave.<br />
      10 For he seeth that wise men also die and perish together, * as well as the ignorant and foolish, and leave their riches for other.<br />
      11 And yet they think that their houses shall continue for ever, and that their dwelling-places shall endure from one generation to another; * and call the lands after their own names.<br />
      12 Nevertheless, man being in honour abideth not, * seeing he may be compared unto the beasts that perish;<br />
      13 This their way is very foolishness; * yet their posterity praise their saying.<br />
      14 They lie in the grave like sheep; death is their shepherd; and the righteous shall have dominion over them in the morning: * their beauty shall consume in the sepulchre, and have no abiding.<br />
      15 But God hath delivered my soul from the power of the grave; * for he shall receive me.<br />
      16 Be not thou afraid, though one be made rich, * or if the glory of his house be increased;<br />
      17 For he shall carry nothing away with him when he dieth, * neither shall his pomp follow him.<br />
      18 For while he lived, he counted himself an happy man; * and so long as thou doest well unto thyself, men will speak good of thee.<br />
      19 He shall follow the generation of his fathers, * and shall never see light.<br />
    20 Man that is in honour but hath no understanding * is compared unto the beasts that perish.
