      <P><B>Psalm 78. Attendite, popule.</B><BR>
      HEAR my law, O my people; * incline your ears unto the words
      of my mouth.<BR>
      2 I will open my mouth in a parable; * I will declare hard sentences
      of old;<BR>
      3 Which we have heard and known, * and such as our fathers have
      told us;<BR>
      4 That we should not hide them from the children of the generations
      to come; * but to show the honour of the LORD, his mighty and
      wonderful works that he hath done.<BR>
      5 He made a covenant with Jacob, and gave Israel a law, * which
      he commanded our forefathers to teach their children;<BR>
      6 That their posterity might know it, * and the children which
      were yet unborn;<BR>
      7 To the intent that when they came up, * they might show their
      children the same;<BR>
      8 That they might put their trust in God; * and not to forget
      the works of God, but to keep his commandments;<BR>
      9 And not to be as their forefathers, a faithless and stubborn
      generation; * a generation that set not their heart aright, and
      whose spirit clave not stedfastly unto God;<BR>
      10 Like as the children of Ephraim; * who being harnessed, and
      carrying bows, turned themselves back in the day of battle.<BR>
      11 They kept not the covenant of God, * and would not walk in
      his law;<BR>
      12 But forgat what he had done, * and the wonderful works that
      he had showed for them.<BR>
      13 Marvellous things did he in the sight of our forefathers,
      in the land of Egypt, * even in the field of Zoan.<BR>
      14 He divided the sea, and let them go through; * he made the
      waters to stand on an heap.<BR>
      15 In the day-time also he led them with a cloud, * and all the
      night through with a light of fire.<BR>
      16 He clave the hard rocks in the wilderness, * and gave them
      drink thereof, as it had been out of the great depth.<BR>
      17 He brought waters out of the stony rock, * so that it gushed
      out like the rivers.<BR>
      18 Yet for all this they sinned more against him, * and provoked
      the Most Highest in the wilderness.<BR>
      19 They tempted God in their hearts, * and required meat for
      their lust.<BR>
      20 They spake against God also, saying, * Shall God prepare a
      table in the wilderness?<BR>
      21 He smote the stony rock indeed, that the water gushed out,
      and the streams flowed withal; * but can he give bread also,
      or provide flesh for his people?<BR>
      22 When the LORD heard this, he was wroth; * so the fire was
      kindled in Jacob, and there came up heavy displeasure against
      Israel;<BR>
      23 Because they believed not in God, * and put not their trust
      in his help.<BR>
      24 So he commanded the clouds above, * and opened the doors of
      heaven.<BR>
      25 He rained down manna also upon them for to eat, * and gave
      them food from heaven.<BR>
      26 So man did eat angels' food; * for he sent them meat enough.<BR>
      27 He caused the east-wind to blow under heaven; * and through
      his power he brought in the southwest-wind.<BR>
      28 He rained flesh upon them as thick as dust, * and feathered
      fowls like as the sand of the sea.<BR>
      29 He let it fall among their tents, * even round about their
      habitation.<BR>
      30 So they did eat, and were well filled; for he gave them their
      own desire: * they were not disappointed of their lust.<BR>
      31 But while the meat was yet in their mouths, the heavy wrath
      of God came upon them, and slew the wealthiest of them; * yea,
      and smote down the chosen men that were in Israel.<BR>
      32 But for all this they sinned yet more, * and believed not
      his wondrous works.<BR>
      33 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, * and their
      years in trouble.<BR>
      34 When he slew them, they sought him, * and turned them early,
      and inquired after God.<BR>
      35 And they remembered that God was their strength, * and that
      the High God was their redeemer.<BR>
      36 Nevertheless, they did but flatter him with their mouth, *
      and dissembled with him in their tongue.<BR>
      37 For their heart was not whole with him, * neither continued
      they stedfast in his covenant.<BR>
      38 But he was so merciful, that he forgave their misdeeds, *
      and destroyed them not.<BR>
      39 Yea, many a time turned he his wrath away, * and would not
      suffer his whole displeasure to arise.<BR>
      40 For he considered that they were but flesh, * and that they
      were even a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.<BR>
      41 Many a time did they provoke him in the wilderness, * and
      grieved him in the desert.<BR>
      42 They turned back, and tempted God, * and provoked the Holy
      One in Israel.<BR>
      43 They thought not of his hand, * and of the day when he delivered
      them from the hand of the enemy;<BR>
      44 How he had wrought his miracles in Egypt, * and his wonders
      in the field of Zoan.<BR>
      45 He turned their waters into blood, * so that they might not
      drink of the rivers.<BR>
      46 He sent flies among them, and devoured them up; * and frogs
      to destroy them.<BR>
      47 He gave their fruit unto the caterpillar, * and their labour
      unto the grasshopper.<BR>
      48 He destroyed their vines with hailstones, * and their mulberry-trees
      with the frost.<BR>
      49 He smote their cattle also with hailstones, * and their flocks
      with hot thunderbolts.<BR>
      50 He cast upon them the furiousness of his wrath, anger, displeasure,
      and trouble: * and sent evil angels among them.<BR>
      51 He made a way to his indignation, and spared not their soul
      from death; * but gave their life over to the pestilence;<BR>
      52 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt, * the most principal
      and mightiest in the dwellings of Ham.<BR>
      53 But as for his own people, he led them forth like sheep, *
      and carried them in the wilderness like a flock.<BR>
      54 He brought them out safely, that they should not fear, * and
      overwhelmed their enemies with the sea.<BR>
      55 And brought them within the borders of his sanctuary, * even
      to this mountain, which he purchased with his right hand.<BR>
      56 He cast out the heathen also before them, * caused their land
      to be divided among them for an heritage, and made the tribes
      of Israel to dwell in their tents.<BR>
      57 Yet they tempted and displeased the Most High God, * and kept
      not his testimonies.<BR>
      58 They turned their backs, and fell away like their forefathers;
      * starting aside like a broken bow.<BR>
      59 For they grieved him with their hill-altars, * and provoked
      him to displeasure with their images.<BR>
      60 When God heard this, he was wroth, * and took sore displeasure
      at Israel;<BR>
      61 So that he forsook the tabernacle in Shiloh, * even the tent
      that he had pitched among men.<BR>
      62 He delivered their power into captivity, * and their beauty
      into the enemy's hand<BR>
      63 He gave his people over also unto the sword, * and was wroth
      with his inheritance.<BR>
      64 The fire consumed their young men, * and their maidens were
      not given in marriage.<BR>
      65 Their priests were slain with the sword, * and there were
      no widows to make lamentation.<BR>
      66 So the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, * and like a giant
      refreshed with wine.<BR>
      67 He drave his enemies backward, * and put them to a perpetual
      shame.<BR>
      68 He refused the tabernacle of Joseph, * and chose not the tribe
      of Ephraim;<BR>
      69 But chose the tribe of Judah, * even the hill of Sion which
      he loved.<BR>
      70 And there he built his temple on high, * and laid the foundation
      of it like the ground which he hath made continually.<BR>
      71 He chose David also his servant, * and took him away from
      the sheep-folds:<BR>
      72 As he was following the ewes with their young he took him,
      * that he might feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.<BR>
      73 So he fed them with a faithful and true heart, * and ruled
      them prudently with all his power.
