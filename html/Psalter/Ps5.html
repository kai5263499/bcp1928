      <P><B>Psalms 5. Verba mea auribus.</B><BR>
      PONDER my words, O LORD, * consider my meditation.<BR>
      2 O hearken thou unto the voice of my calling, my King and my
      God: * for unto thee will I make my prayer.<BR>
      3 My voice shalt thou hear betimes, O LORD; * early in the morning
      will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.<BR>
      4 For thou art the God that hast no pleasure in wickedness; *
      neither shall any evil dwell with thee.<BR>
      5 Such as be foolish shall not stand in thy sight; * for thou
      hatest all them that work iniquity.<BR>
      6 Thou shalt destroy them that speak lies: * the LORD will abhor
      both the blood-thirsty and deceitful man.<BR>
      7 But as for me, in the multitude of thy mercy I will come into
      thine house; * and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy
      temple.<BR>
      8 Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness, because of mine enemies;
      * make thy way plain before my face.<BR>
      9 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; * their inward
      parts are very wickedness.<BR>
      10 Their throat is an open sepulchre; * they flatter with their
      tongue.<BR>
      11 Destroy thou them, O God; let them perish through their own
      imaginations; * cast them out in the multitude of their ungodliness;
      for they have rebelled against thee.<BR>
      12 And let all them that put their trust in thee rejoice: * they
      shall ever be giving of thanks, because thou defendest them;
      they that love thy Name shall be joyful in thee;<BR>
      13 For thou, LORD, wilt give thy blessing unto the righteous,
      * and with thy favourable kindness wilt thou defend him as with
      a shield.
