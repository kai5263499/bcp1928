      <P><B>Psalm 66. Jubilate Deo.</B><BR>
      O BE joyful in God, all ye lands; * sing praises unto the honour
      of his Name; make his praise to be glorious.<BR>
      2 Say unto God, O how wonderful art thou in thy works! * through
      the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies bow down unto
      thee.<BR>
      3 For all the world shall worship thee, * sing of thee, and praise
      thy Name.<BR>
      4 O come hither, and behold the works of God; * how wonderful
      he is in his doing toward the children of men.<BR>
      5 He turned the sea into dry land, * so that they went through
      the water on foot; there did we rejoice thereof.<BR>
      6 He ruleth with his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations:
      * and such as will not believe shall not be able to exalt themselves.<BR>
      7 O praise our God, ye peoples, * and make the voice of his praise
      to be heard;<BR>
      8 Who holdeth our soul in life; * and suffereth not our feet
      to slip.<BR>
      9 For thou, O God, hast proved us; * thou also hast tried us,
      like as silver is tried.<BR>
      10 Thou broughtest us into the snare; * and laidest trouble upon
      our loins.<BR>
      11 Thou sufferedst men to ride over our heads; * we went through
      fire and water, and thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.<BR>
      12 I will go into thine house with burnt-offerings, and will
      pay thee my vows, * which I promised with my lips, and spake
      with my mouth, when I was in trouble.<BR>
      13 I will offer unto thee fat burnt-sacrifices, with the incense
      of rams; * I will offer bullocks and goats.<BR>
      14 O come hither, and hearken, all ye that fear God; * and I
      will tell you what he hath done for my soul.<BR>
      15 I called unto him with my mouth, * and gave him praises with
      my tongue.<BR>
      16 If I incline unto wickedness with mine heart, * the Lord will
      not hear me.<BR>
      17 But God hath heard me; * and considered the voice of my prayer.<BR>
      18 Praised be God, who hath not cast out my prayer, * nor turned
      his mercy from me.
