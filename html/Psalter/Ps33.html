      <P><B>Psalms 33. Exultate, justi.</B><BR>
      REJOICE in the LORD, O ye righteous; * for it becometh well the
      just to be thankful.<BR>
      2 Praise the LORD with harp; * sing praises unto him with the
      lute, and instrument of ten strings.<BR>
      3 Sing unto the Lord a new song; * sing praises lustily unto
      him with a good courage.<BR>
      4 For the word of the LORD is true; * and all his works are faithful.<BR>
      5 He loveth righteousness and judgment; * the earth is full of
      the goodness of the LORD.<BR>
      6 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; * and all the
      host of them by the breath of his mouth.<BR>
      7 He gathereth the waters of the sea together, as it were upon
      an heap; * and layeth up the deep, as in a treasure-house.<BR>
      8 Let all the earth fear the LORD: * stand in awe of him, all
      ye that dwell in the world.<BR>
      9 For he spake, and it was done; * he commanded, and it stood
      fast.<BR>
      10 The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought, *
      and maketh the devices of the people to be of none effect, and
      casteth out the counsels of princes.<BR>
      11 The counsel of the LORD shall endure for ever, * and the thoughts
      of his heart from generation to generation.<BR>
      12 Blessed are the people whose God is the Lord JEHOVAH; * and
      blessed are the folk that he hath chosen to him, to be his inheritance.<BR>
      13 The LORD looketh down from heaven, and beholdeth all the children
      of men; * from the habitation of his dwelling, he considereth
      all them that dwell on the earth.<BR>
      14 He fashioneth all the hearts of them, * and understandeth
      all their works.<BR>
      15 There is no king that can be saved by the multitude of an
      host; * neither is any mighty man delivered by much strength.<BR>
      16 A horse is counted but a vain thing to save a man; * neither
      shall he deliver any man by his great strength.<BR>
      17 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, *
      and upon them that put their trust in his mercy;<BR>
      18 To deliver their soul from death, * and to feed them in the
      time of dearth.<BR>
      19 Our soul hath patiently tarried for the LORD; * for he is
      our help and our shield.<BR>
      20 For our heart shall rejoice in him; * because we have hoped
      in his holy Name.<BR>
      21 Let thy merciful kindness, O LORD, be upon us, * like as we
      do put our trust in thee.
