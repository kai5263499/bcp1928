      <P><B>Psalms 12. Salvum me fac.</B><BR>
      HELP me, LORD, for there is not one godly man left; * for the
      faithful are minished from among the children of men.<BR>
      2 They talk of vanity every one with his neighbour; * they do
      but flatter with their lips, and dissemble in their double heart.<BR>
      3 The LORD shall root out all deceitful lips, * and the tongue
      that speaketh proud things;<BR>
      4 Which have said, With our tongue will we prevail; * we are
      they that ought to speak; who is lord over us?<BR>
      5 Now, for the comfortless troubles' sake of the needy, * and
      because of the deep sighing of the poor,<BR>
      6 I will up, saith the LORD; * and will help every one from him
      that swelleth against him, and will set him at rest.<BR>
      7 The words of the LORD are pure words; * even as the silver
      which from the earth is tried, and purified seven times in the
      fire.<BR>
      8 Thou shalt keep them, O LORD; * thou shalt preserve them from
      this generation for ever.<BR>
      9 The ungodly walk on every side: * when they are exalted, the
      children of men are put to rebuke.
