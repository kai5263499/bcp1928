<BR>
      Morning Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 144. Benedictus Dominus.</B><BR>
      BLESSED be the LORD my strength, * who teacheth my hands to war,
      and my fingers to fight:<BR>
      2 My hope and my fortress, my castle and deliverer, my defender
      in whom I trust; * who subdueth my people that is under me.<BR>
      3 LORD, what is man, that thou hast such respect unto him? *
      or the son of man, that thou so regardest him?<BR>
      4 Man is like a thing of nought; * his time passeth away like
      a shadow.<BR>
      5 Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down; * touch the mountains,
      and they shall smoke.<BR>
      6 Cast forth thy lightning, and tear them; * shoot out thine
      arrows, and consume them.<BR>
      7 Send down thine hand from above; * deliver me, and take me
      out of the great waters, from the hand of strangers;<BR>
      8 Whose mouth talketh of vanity, * and their right hand is a
      right hand of wickedness.<BR>
      9 I will sing a new song unto thee, O God; * and sing praises
      unto thee upon a ten-stringed lute.<BR>
      10 Thou hast given victory unto kings, * and hast delivered David
      thy servant from the peril of the sword.<BR>
      11 Save me, and deliver me from the hand of strangers, * whose
      mouth talketh of vanity, and their right hand is a right hand
      of iniquity:<BR>
      12 That our sons may grow up as the young plants, * and that
      our daughters may be as the polished corners of the temple;<BR>
      13 That our garners may be full and plenteous with all manner
      of store; * that our sheep may bring forth thousands, and ten
      thousands in our fields;<BR>
      14 That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no decay,
      * no leading into captivity, and no complaining in our streets.<BR>
      15 Happy are the people that are in such a case; * yea, blessed
      are the people who have the LORD for their God.<BR>
      <B><BR>
<BR>
      Psalm 145. Exaltabo te, Deus.</B><BR>
      I WILL magnify thee, O God, my King; * and I will praise thy
      Name for ever and ever.<BR>
      2 Every day will I give thanks unto thee; * and praise thy Name
      for ever and ever.<BR>
      3 Great is the LORD, and marvellous worthy to be praised; * there
      is no end of his greatness.<BR>
      4 One generation shall praise thy works unto another, * and declare
      thy power.<BR>
      5 As for me, I will be talking of thy worship, * thy glory, thy
      praise, and wondrous works;<BR>
      6 So that men shall speak of the might of thy marvellous acts;
      * and I will also tell of thy greatness.<BR>
      7 The memorial of thine abundant kindness shall be showed; *
      and men shall sing of thy righteousness.<BR>
      8 The LORD is gracious and merciful; * long-suffering, and of
      great goodness.<BR>
      9 The LORD is loving unto every man; * and his mercy is over
      all his works.<BR>
      10 All thy works praise thee, O LORD; * and thy saints give thanks
      unto thee.<BR>
      11 They show the glory of thy kingdom, * and talk of thy power;<BR>
      12 That thy power, thy glory, and mightiness of thy kingdom,
      * might be known unto men.<BR>
      13 Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, * and thy dominion
      endureth throughout all ages.<BR>
      14 The LORD upholdeth all such as fall, * and lifteth up all
      those that are down.<BR>
      15 The eyes of all wait upon thee, O Lord; * and thou givest
      them their meat in due season.<BR>
      16 Thou openest thine hand, * and fillest all things living with
      plenteousness.<BR>
      17 The LORD is righteous in all his ways, * and holy in all his
      works.<BR>
      18 The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him; * yea,
      all such as call upon him faithfully.<BR>
      19 He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him; * he also
      will hear their cry, and will help them.<BR>
      20 The LORD preserveth all them that love him; * but scattereth
      abroad all the ungodly.<BR>
      21 My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD; * and let all
      flesh give thanks unto his holy Name for ever and ever.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 146. Lauda, anima mea.</B><BR>
      PRAISE the LORD, O my soul: while I live, will I praise the LORD;
      * yea, as long as I have any being, I will sing praises unto
      my God.<BR>
      2 O put not your trust in princes, nor in any child of man; *
      for there is no help in them.<BR>
      3 For when the breath of man goeth forth, he shall turn again
      to his earth, * and then all his thoughts perish.<BR>
      4 Blessed is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, * and
      whose hope is in the LORD his God:<BR>
      5 Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that therein is;
      * who keepeth his promise for ever;<BR>
      6 Who helpeth them to right that suffer wrong; * who feedeth
      the hungry.<BR>
      7 The LORD looseth men out of prison; * the LORD giveth sight
      to the blind.<BR>
      8 The LORD helpeth them that are fallen; * the LORD careth for
      the righteous.<BR>
      9 The LORD careth for the strangers; he defendeth the fatherless
      and widow: * as for the way of the ungodly, he turneth it upside
      down.<BR>
      10 The LORD thy God, O Sion, shall be King for evermore, * and
      throughout all generations.<BR>

      <P><CENTER><A NAME="anchor484202"></A>Evening Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 147. Laudate Dominum.</B><BR>
      PRAISE the LORD, for it is a good thing to sing praises unto
      our God; * yea, a joyful and pleasant thing it is to be thankful.<BR>
      2 The LORD doth build up Jerusalem, * and gather together the
      outcasts of Israel.<BR>
      3 He healeth those that are broken in heart, * and giveth medicine
      to heal their sickness.<BR>
      4 He telleth the number of the stars, * and calleth them all
      by their names.<BR>
      5 Great is our Lord, and great is his power; * yea, and his wisdom
      is infinite.<BR>
      6 The LORD setteth up the meek, * and bringeth the ungodly down
      to the ground.<BR>
      7 O sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; * sing praises upon
      the harp unto our God:<BR>
      8 Who covereth the heaven with clouds, and prepareth rain for
      the earth; * and maketh the grass to grow upon the mountains,
      and herb for the use of men;<BR>
      9 Who giveth fodder unto the cattle, * and feedeth the young
      ravens that call upon him.<BR>
      10 He hath no pleasure in the strength of an horse; * neither
      delighteth he in any man's legs.<BR>
      11 But the LORD'S delight is in them that fear him, * and put
      their trust in his mercy. ~<BR>
      12 Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; * praise thy God, O Sion.<BR>
      13 For he hath made fast the bars of thy gates, * and hath blessed
      thy children within thee.<BR>
      14 He maketh peace in thy borders, * and filleth thee with the
      flour of wheat.<BR>
      15 He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth, * and his word
      runneth very swiftly.<BR>
      16 He giveth snow like wool, * and scattereth the hoarfrost like
      ashes.<BR>
      17 He casteth forth his ice like morsels: * who is able to abide
      his frost?<BR>
      18 He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: * he bloweth with
      his wind, and the waters flow.<BR>
      19 He showeth his word unto Jacob, * his statutes and ordinances
      unto Israel.<BR>
      20 He hath not dealt so with any nation; * neither have the heathen
      knowledge of his laws.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 148. Laudate Dominum.</B><BR>
      O PRAISE the LORD from the heavens: * praise him in the heights.<BR>
      2 Praise him, all ye angels of his: * praise him, all his host.<BR>
      3 Praise him, sun and moon: * praise him, all ye stars and light.<BR>
      4 Praise him, all ye heavens, * and ye waters that are above
      the heavens.<BR>
      5 Let them praise the Name of the LORD: * for he spake the word,
      and they were made; he commanded, and they were created.<BR>
      6 He hath made them fast for ever and ever: * he hath given them
      a law which shall not be broken.<BR>
      7 Praise the LORD from the earth, * ye dragons and all deeps;<BR>
      8 Fire and hail, snow and vapours, * wind and storm, fulfilling
      his word;<BR>
      9 Mountains and all hills; * fruitful trees and all cedars;<BR>
      10 Beasts and all cattle; * creeping things and flying fowls;<BR>
      11 Kings of the earth, and all peoples; * princes, and all judges
      of the world;<BR>
      12 Young men and maidens, old men and children, praise the Name
      of the LORD: * for his Name only is excellent, and his praise
      above heaven and earth.<BR>
      13 He shall exalt the horn of his people: all his saints shall
      praise him; * even the children of Israel, even the people that
      serveth him.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 149. Cantate Domino.</B><BR>
      O SING unto the LORD a new song; * let the congregation of saints
      praise him.<BR>
      2 Let Israel rejoice in him that made him, * and let the children
      of Sion be joyful in their King.<BR>
      3 Let them praise his Name in the dance: * let them sing praises
      unto him with tabret and harp.<BR>
      4 For the LORD hath pleasure in his people, * and helpeth the
      meek-hearted.<BR>
      5 Let the saints be joyful with glory; * let them rejoice in
      their beds.<BR>
      6 Let the praises of God be in their mouth; * and a two-edged
      sword in their hands;<BR>
      7 To be avenged of the nations, * and to rebuke the peoples;<BR>
      8 To bind their kings in chains, * and their nobles with links
      of iron;<BR>
      9 To execute judgment upon them; as it is written, * Such honour
      have all his saints.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 150. Laudate Dominum.</B><BR>
      O PRAISE God in his sanctuary: * praise him in the firmament
      of his power.<BR>
      2 Praise him in his noble acts: * praise him according to his
      excellent greatness.<BR>
      3 Praise him in the sound of the trumpet: * praise him upon the
      lute and harp.<BR>
      4 Praise him in the timbrels and dances: * praise him upon the
      strings and pipe.<BR>
      5 Praise him upon the well-tuned cymbals: * praise him upon the
      loud cymbals.<BR>
      6 Let every thing that hath breath * praise the LORD.<BR>
