    <p><strong>Psalm 119. (Cont)<br />
      X. Manus tuae fecerunt me.</strong><br />
      THY hands have made me and fashioned me: * O give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.<br />
      74 They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; * because I have put my trust in thy word.<br />
      75 I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, * and that thou of very faithfulness hast caused me to be troubled.<br />
      76 O let thy merciful kindness be my comfort, * according to thy word unto thy servant.<br />
      77 O let thy loving mercies come unto me, that I may live; * for thy law is my delight.<br />
      78 Let the proud be confounded, for they go wickedly about to destroy me; * but I will be occupied in thy commandments.<br />
      79 Let such as fear thee, and have known thy testimonies, * be turned unto me.<br />
      80 O let my heart be sound in thy statutes, * that I be not ashamed.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>XI. Defecit anima mea.</strong><br />
      MY soul hath longed for thy salvation, * and I have a good hope because of thy word.<br />
      82 Mine eyes-long sore for thy word; * saying, O when wilt thou comfort me?<br />
      83 For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; * yet do I not forget thy statutes.<br />
      84 How many are the days of thy servant? * when wilt thou be avenged of them that persecute me?<br />
      85 The proud have digged pits for me, * which are not after thy law.<br />
      86 All thy commandments are true: * they persecute me falsely; O be thou my help.<br />
      87 They had almost made an end of me upon earth; * but I forsook not thy commandments.<br />
      88 O quicken me after thy loving-kindness; * and so shall I keep the testimonies of thy mouth.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>XII. In aeternum, Domine.</strong><br />
      O LORD, thy word * endureth for ever in heaven. go Thy truth also remaineth from one generation to another; * thou hast laid the foundation of the earth, and it abideth.<br />
      91 They continue this day according to thine ordinance; * for all things serve thee.<br />
      92 If my delight had not been in thy law, * I should have perished in my trouble.<br />
      93 I will never forget thy commandments; * for with them thou hast quickened me.<br />
      94 I am thine: O save me, * for I have sought thy commandments.<br />
      95 The ungodly laid wait for me, to destroy me; * but I will consider thy testimonies.<br />
      96 I see that all things come to an end; * but thy commandment is exceeding broad.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>XIII. Quomodo dilexi!</strong><br />
      LORD, what love have I unto thy law! * all the day long is my study in it.<br />
      98 Thou, through thy commandments, hast made me wiser than mine enemies; * for they are ever with me.<br />
      99 I have more understanding than my teachers; * for thy testimonies are my study.<br />
      100 I am wiser than the aged; * because I keep thy commandments.<br />
      101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, * that I may keep thy word.<br />
      102 I have not shrunk from thy judgments; * for thou teachest me.<br />
      103 O how sweet are thy words unto my throat; * yea, sweeter than honey unto my mouth!<br />
    104 Through thy commandments I get understanding: * therefore I hate all evil ways.
