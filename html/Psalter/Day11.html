      The Eleventh Day.<BR>
<BR>
      Morning Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 56. Miserere mei, Deus.</B><BR>
      BE merciful unto me, O God, for man goeth about to devour me;
      * he is daily fighting, and troubling me.<BR>
      2 Mine enemies are daily at hand to swallow me up; * for they
      be many that fight against me, O thou Most Highest.<BR>
      3 Nevertheless, though I am sometime afraid, * yet put I my trust
      in thee.<BR>
      4 I will praise God, because of his word: * I have put my trust
      in God, and will not fear what flesh can do unto me.<BR>
      5 They daily mistake my words; * all that they imagine is to
      do me evil.<BR>
      6 They hold all together, and keep themselves close, * and mark
      my steps, when they lay wait for my soul.<BR>
      7 Shall they escape for their wickedness? * thou, O God, in thy
      displeasure shalt cast them down.<BR>
      8 Thou tellest my wanderings; put my tears into thy bottle: *
      are not these things noted in thy book?<BR>
      9 Whensoever I call upon thee, then shall mine enemies be put
      to flight: * this I know; for God is on my side.<BR>
      10 In God's word will I rejoice; * in the LORD'S word will I
      comfort me.<BR>
      11 Yea, in God have I put my trust; * I will not be afraid what
      man can do unto me.<BR>
      12 Unto thee, O God, will I pay my vows; * unto thee will I give
      thanks.<BR>
      13 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, and my feet from
      falling, * that I may walk before God in the light of the living.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 57. Miserere mei, Deus.</B><BR>
      BE merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me; for my soul
      trusteth in thee; * and under the shadow of thy wings shall be
      my refuge, until this tyranny be overpast.<BR>
      2 I will call unto the Most High God, * even unto the God that
      shall perform the cause which I have in hand.<BR>
      3 He shall send from heaven, * and save me from the reproof of
      him that would eat me up.<BR>
      4 God shall send forth his mercy and truth: * my soul is among
      lions;<BR>
      5 And I lie even among the children of men, that are set on fire,
      * whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp
      sword.<BR>
      6 Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens; * and thy glory above
      all the earth.<BR>
      7 They have laid a net for my feet, and pressed down my soul;
      * they have digged a pit before me, and are fallen into the midst
      of it themselves.<BR>
      8 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed; * I will sing
      and give praise.<BR>
      9 Awake up, my glory; awake, lute and harp: * I myself will awake
      right early.<BR>
      10 I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the peoples; *
      and I will sing unto thee among the nations.<BR>
      11 For the greatness of thy mercy reacheth unto the heavens,
      * and thy truth unto the clouds.<BR>
      12 Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens; * and thy glory
      above all the earth.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 58. Si vere utique.</B><BR>
      ARE your minds set upon righteousness, O ye congregation? * and
      do ye judge the thing that is right, O ye sons of men?<BR>
      2 Yea, ye imagine mischief in your heart upon the earth, * and
      your hands deal with wickedness.<BR>
      3 The ungodly are froward, even from their mother's womb; * as
      soon as they are born, they go astray, and speak lies.<BR>
      4 They are as venomous as the poison of a serpent, * even like
      the deaf adder, that stoppeth her ears;<BR>
      5 Which refuseth to hear the voice of the charmer, * charm he
      never so wisely.<BR>
      6 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouths; * smite the jaw-bones
      of the lions, O LORD.<BR>
      7 Let them fall away like water that runneth apace; * when they
      shoot their arrows, let them be rooted out.<BR>
      8 Let them consume away like a snail, and be like the untimely
      fruit of a woman; * and let them not see the sun.<BR>
      9 Or ever your pots be made hot with thorns, * he shall take
      them away with a whirlwind, the green and the burning alike.<BR>
      10 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance; *
      he shall wash his footsteps in the blood of the ungodly.<BR>
      11 So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the
      righteous; * doubtless there is a God that judgeth the earth.<BR>

      <P><CENTER><A NAME="anchor436610"></A>Evening Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 59. Eripe me de inimicis.</B><BR>
      DELIVER me from mine enemies, O God; * defend me from them that
      rise up against me.<BR>
      2 O deliver me from the wicked doers, * and save me from the
      blood-thirsty men.<BR>
      3 For lo, they lie waiting for my soul; * the mighty men are
      gathered against me, without any offence or fault of me, O LORD.<BR>
      4 They run and prepare themselves without my fault; * arise thou
      therefore to help me, and behold.<BR>
      5 Stand up, O LORD God of hosts, thou God of Israel, to visit
      all the heathen, * and be not merciful unto them that offend
      of malicious wickedness.<BR>
      6 They go to and fro in the evening, * they grin like a dog,
      and run about through the city.<BR>
      7 Behold, they speak with their mouth, and swords are in their
      lips; * for who doth hear?<BR>
      8 But thou, O LORD, shalt have them in derision, * and thou shalt
      laugh all the heathen to scorn.<BR>
      9 My strength will I ascribe unto thee; * for thou art the God
      of my refuge.<BR>
      10 God showeth me his goodness plenteously; * and God shall let
      me see my desire upon mine enemies.<BR>
      11 Slay them not, lest my people forget it; * but scatter them
      abroad among the people, and put them down, O Lord our defence.<BR>
      12 For the sin of their mouth, and for the words of their lips,
      they shall be taken in their pride: * and why? their talk is
      of cursing and lies.<BR>
      13 Consume them in thy wrath, consume them, that they may perish;
      * and know that it is God that ruleth in Jacob, and unto the
      ends of the world.<BR>
      14 And in the evening they will return, * grin like a dog, and
      will go about the city.<BR>
      15 They will run here and there for meat, * and grudge if they
      be not satisfied.<BR>
      16 As for me, I will sing of thy power, and will praise thy mercy
      betimes in the morning; * for thou hast been my defence and refuge
      in the day of my trouble.<BR>
      17 Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing; * for thou, O God,
      art my refuge, and my merciful God.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 60. Deus, repulisti nos.</B><BR>
      O GOD, thou hast cast us out, and scattered us abroad; * thou
      hast also been displeased: O turn thee unto us again.<BR>
      2 Thou hast moved the land, and divided it: * heal the sores
      thereof, for it shaketh.<BR>
      3 Thou hast showed thy people heavy things; * thou hast given
      us a drink of deadly wine.<BR>
      4 Thou hast given a token for such as fear thee, * that they
      may triumph because of the truth.<BR>
      5 Therefore were thy beloved delivered; * help me with thy right
      hand, and hear me.<BR>
      6 God hath spoken in his holiness, I will rejoice, and divide
      Shechem, * and mete out the valley of Succoth.<BR>
      7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; * Ephraim also is the
      strength of my head; Judah is my law-giver;<BR>
      8 Moab is my wash-pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; * Philistia,
      be thou glad of me.<BR>
      9 Who will lead me into the strong city? * who will bring me
      into Edom?<BR>
      10 Hast not thou cast us out, O God? * wilt not thou, O God,
      go out with our hosts?<BR>
      11 O be thou our help in trouble; * for vain is the help of man.<BR>
      12 Through God will we do great acts; * for it is he that shall
      tread down our enemies.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 61. Exaudi, Deus.</B><BR>
      HEAR my crying, O God, * give ear unto my prayer.<BR>
      2 From the ends of the earth will I call upon thee, * when my
      heart is in heaviness.<BR>
      3 O set me up upon the rock that is higher than I; * for thou
      hast been my hope, and a strong tower for me against the enemy.<BR>
      4 I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever, * and my trust shall
      be under the covering of thy wings.<BR>
      5 For thou, O Lord, hast heard my desires, * and hast given an
      heritage unto those that fear thy Name.<BR>
      6 Thou shalt grant the King a long life, * that his years may
      endure throughout all generations.<BR>
      7 He shall dwell before God for ever: * O prepare thy loving
      mercy and faithfulness, that they may preserve him.<BR>
      8 So will I alway sing praise unto thy Name, * that I may daily
      perform my vows.</P>
