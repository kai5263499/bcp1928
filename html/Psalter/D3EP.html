    <p><strong>Psalm 18. Diligam te, Domine.</strong><br />
      I WILL love thee, O LORD, my strength. * The LORD is my stony rock, and my defence;<br />
      2 My Saviour, my God, and my might, in whom I will trust; * my buckler, the horn also of my salvation, and my refuge.<br />
      3 I will call upon the LORD, which is worthy to be praised; * so shall I be safe from mine enemies.<br />
      4 The sorrows of death compassed me, * and the overflowings of ungodliness made me afraid.<br />
      5 The pains of hell came about me; * the snares of death overtook me.<br />
      6 In my trouble I called upon the LORD, * and complained unto my God:<br />
      7 So he heard my voice out of his holy temple, * and my complaint came before him; it entered even into his ears.<br />
      8 The earth trembled and quaked, * the very foundations also of the hills shook, and were removed, because he was wroth.<br />
      9 There went a smoke out in his presence, * and a consuming fire out of his mouth, so that coals were kindled at it.<br />
      10 He bowed the heavens also, and came down, * and it was dark under his feet.<br />
      11 He rode upon the Cherubim, and did fly; * he came flying upon the wings of the wind.<br />
      12 He made darkness his secret place, * his pavilion round about him with dark water, and thick clouds to cover him.<br />
      13 At the brightness of his presence his clouds removed; * hailstones and coals of fire.<br />
      14 The LORD also thundered out of heaven, and the Highest gave his thunder; * hailstones and coals of fire.<br />
      15 He sent out his arrows, and scattered them; * he cast forth lightnings, and destroyed them.<br />
      16 The springs of waters were seen, and the foundations of the round world were discovered, * at thy chiding, O LORD, at the blasting of the breath of thy displeasure.<br />
      17 He sent down from on high to fetch me, * and took me out of many waters.<br />
      18 He delivered me from my strongest enemy, and from them which hate me; * for they were too mighty for me.<br />
      19 They came upon me in the day of my trouble; * but the LORD was my upholder.<br />
      20 He brought me forth also into a place of liberty; * he brought me forth, even because he had a favour unto me.<br />
      21 The LORD rewarded me after my righteous dealing, * according to the cleanness of my hands did he recompense me.<br />
      22 Because I have kept the ways of the LORD, * and have not forsaken my God, as the wicked doth.<br />
      23 For I have an eye unto all his laws, * and will not cast out his commandments from me.<br />
      24 I was also uncorrupt before him, * and eschewed mine own wickedness.<br />
      25 Therefore the LORD rewarded me after my righteous dealing, * and according unto the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.<br />
      26 With the holy thou shalt be holy, * and with a perfect man thou shalt be perfect.<br />
      27 With the clean thou shalt be clean, * and with the froward thou shalt be froward.<br />
      28 For thou shalt save the people that are in adversity, and shalt bring down the high looks of the proud.<br />
      29 Thou also shalt light my candle; * the LORD my God shall make my darkness to be light.<br />
      30 For in thee I shall discomfit an host of men, * and with the help of my God I shall leap over the wall.<br />
      31 The way of God is an undefiled way: * the word of the LORD also is tried in the fire; he is the defender of all them that put their trust in him.<br />
      32 For who is God, but the LORD? * or who hath any strength, except our God?<br />
      33 It is God that girdeth me with strength of war, * and maketh my way perfect.<br />
      34 He maketh my feet like harts' feet, * and setteth me up on high.<br />
      35 He teacheth mine hands to fight, * and mine arms shall bend even a bow of steel.<br />
      36 Thou hast given me the defence of thy salvation; * thy right hand also shall hold me up, and thy loving correction shall make me great.<br />
      37 Thou shalt make room enough under me for to go, * that my footsteps shall not slide.<br />
      38 I will follow upon mine enemies, and overtake them; * neither will I turn again till I have destroyed them.<br />
      39 I will smite them, that they shall not be able to stand, * but fall under my feet.<br />
      40 Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle; * thou shalt throw down mine enemies under me.<br />
      41 Thou hast made mine enemies also to turn their backs upon me, * and I shall destroy them that hate me.<br />
      42 They shall cry, but there shall be none to help them; * yea, even unto the LORD shall they cry, but he shall not hear them.<br />
      43 I will beat them as small as the dust before the wind: * I will cast them out as the clay in the streets.<br />
      44 Thou shalt deliver me from the strivings of the people, * and thou shalt make me the head of the nations; a people whom I have not known shall serve me.<br />
      45 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me; * the strangers shall feign obedience unto me.<br />
      46 The strangers shall fail, * and come trembling out of their strongholds.<br />
      47 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my strong helper, * and praised be the God of my salvation;<br />
      48 Even the God that seeth that I be avenged, * and subdueth the people unto me.<br />
      49 It is he that delivereth me from my cruel enemies, and setteth me up above mine adversaries: * thou shalt rid me from the wicked man.<br />
      50 For this cause will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the Gentiles, * and sing praises unto thy Name.<br />
      51 Great prosperity giveth he unto his King, * and showeth loving-kindness unto David his anointed, and unto his seed for evermore. </p>
