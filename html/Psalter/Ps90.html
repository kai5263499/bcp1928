      <P><B>Psalm 90. Domine, refugium.</B><BR>
      LORD, thou hast been our refuge, * from one generation to another.<BR>
      2 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth
      and the world were made, * thou art God from everlasting, and
      world without end.<BR>
      3 Thou turnest man to destruction; * again thou sayest, Come
      again, ye children of men.<BR>
      4 For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when
      it is past, * and as a watch in the night.<BR>
      5 As soon as thou scatterest them they are even as a sleep; *
      and fade away suddenly like the grass.<BR>
      6 In the morning it is green, and groweth up; * but in the evening
      it is cut down, dried up, and withered.<BR>
      7 For we consume away in thy displeasure, * and are afraid at
      thy wrathful indignation.<BR>
      8 Thou hast set our misdeeds before thee; * and our secret sins
      in the light of thy countenance.<BR>
      9 For when thou art angry all our days are gone: * we bring our
      years to an end, as it were a tale that is told.<BR>
      10 The days of our age are threescore years and ten; and though
      men be so strong that they come to fourscore years, * yet is
      their strength then but labour and sorrow; so soon passeth it
      away, and we are gone.<BR>
      11 But who regardeth the power of thy wrath? * or feareth aright
      thy indignation?<BR>
      12 So teach us to number our days, * that we may apply our hearts
      unto wisdom.<BR>
      13 Turn thee again, O LORD, at the last, * and be gracious unto
      thy servants.<BR>
      14 O satisfy us with thy mercy, and that soon: * so shall we
      rejoice and be glad all the days of our life.<BR>
      15 Comfort us again now after the time that thou hast plagued
      us; * and for the years wherein we have suffered adversity.<BR>
      16 Show thy servants thy work, * and their children thy glory.<BR>
      17 And the glorious majesty of the LORD our God be upon us: *
      prosper thou the work of our hands upon us; O prosper thou our
      handy-work.
