Confitemini Domino.</B><BR />O GIVE thanks unto the LORD, for he is gracious, * and his mercy
endureth for ever.<BR />2 Let them give thanks whom the LORD hath redeemed, * and delivered
from the hand of the enemy;<BR />3 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from
the west; * from the north, and from the south.<BR />4 They went astray in the wilderness out of the way, * and found
no city to dwell in.<BR />5 Hungry and thirsty, * their soul fainted in them.<BR />6 So they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, * and he delivered
them from their distress.<BR />7 He led them forth by the right way, * that they might go to
the city where they dwelt.<BR />8 O that men would therefore praise the LORD for his goodness;
* and declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men!<BR />9 For he satisfieth the empty soul, * and filleth the hungry soul
with goodness.<BR />10 Such as sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death, * being
fast bound in misery and iron;<BR />11 Because they rebelled against the words of the Lord, * and
lightly regarded the counsel of the Most Highest;<BR />12 He also brought down their heart through heaviness: * they
fell down, and there was none to help them.<BR />13 SO when they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, * he delivered
them out of their distress.<BR />14 For he brought them out of darkness, and out of the shadow
of death, * and brake their bonds in sunder.<BR />15 O that men would therefore praise the LORD for his goodness;
* and declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men
!<BR />16 For he hath broken the gates of brass, * and smitten the bars
of iron in sunder.<BR />17 Foolish men are plagued for their offence, * and because of
their wickedness.<BR />18 Their soul abhorred all manner of meat, * and they were even
hard at death's door.<BR />19 So when they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, * he delivered
them out of their distress.<BR />20 He sent his word, and healed them; * and they were saved from
their destruction.<BR />21 O that men would therefore praise the LORD for his goodness;
* and declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men
!<BR />22 That they would offer unto him the sacrifice of thanksgiving,
* and tell out his works with gladness!<BR />23 They that go down to the sea in ships, * and occupy their business
in great waters;<BR />24 These men see the works of the LORD, * and his wonders in the
deep.<BR />25 For at his word the stormy wind ariseth, * which lifteth up
the waves thereof.<BR />26 They are carried up to the heaven, and down again to the deep;
* their soul melteth away because of the trouble.<BR />27 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, * and
are at their wit's end.<BR />28 SO when they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, * he delivereth
them out of their distress.<BR />29 For he maketh the storm to cease, * so that the waves thereof
are still.<BR />30 Then are they glad, because they are at rest; * and so he bringeth
them unto the haven where they would be.<BR />31 O that men would therefore praise the LORD for his goodness;
* and declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men!<BR />32 That they would exalt him also in the congregation of the people,
* and praise him in the seat of the elders!<BR />33 He turneth the floods into a wilderness, * and drieth up the
water-springs.<BR />34 A fruitful land maketh he barren, * for the wickedness of them
that dwell therein.<BR />35 Again, he maketh the wilderness a standing water, * and water-springs
of a dry ground.<BR />36 And there he setteth the hungry, * that they may build them
a city to dwell in;<BR />37 That they may sow their land, and plant vineyards, * to yield
them fruits of increase.<BR />38 He blesseth them, so that they multiply exceedingly; * and
suffereth not their cattle to decrease.<BR />39 And again, when they are minished and brought low * through
oppression, through any plague or trouble;<BR />40 Though he suffer them to be evil entreated through tyrants,
* and let them wander out of the way in the wilderness;<BR />41 Yet helpeth he the poor out of misery, * and maketh him households
like a flock of sheep.<BR />42 The righteous will consider this, and rejoice; * and the mouth
of all wickedness shall be stopped.<BR />43 Whoso is wise, will ponder these things; * and they shall understand
the loving-kindness of the LORD.<BR /></p><P><CENTER>Evening Prayer.</CENTER></p><P><B>Psalm 108. Paratum cor meum.</B><BR />O GOD, my heart is ready, my heart is ready; * I will sing, and
give praise with the best member that I have.<BR />2 Awake, thou lute and harp; * I myself will awake right early.<BR />3 I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the peoples; * I
will sing praises unto thee among the nations.<BR />4 For thy mercy is greater than the heavens, * and thy truth reacheth
unto the clouds.<BR />5 Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens, * and thy glory above
all the earth;<BR />6 That thy beloved may be delivered: * let thy right hand save
them, and hear thou me.<BR />7 God hath spoken in his holiness; * I will rejoice therefore,
and divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.<BR />8 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; * Ephraim also is the
strength of my head; Judah is my lawgiver;<BR />9 Moab is my wash-pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; * upon
Philistia will I triumph.<BR />10 Who will lead me into the strong city? * and who will bring
me into Edom?<BR />11 Hast not thou forsaken us, O God? * and wilt not thou, O God,
go forth with our hosts?<BR />12 O help us against the enemy: * for vain is the help of man.<BR />13 Through God we shall do great acts; * and it is he that shall
tread down our enemies.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 109. Deus, laudem.</B><BR />HOLD not thy tongue, O God of my praise; * for the mouth of the
ungodly, yea, the mouth of the deceitful is opened upon me.<BR />2 And they have spoken against me with false tongues; * they compassed
me about also with words of hatred, and fought against me without
a cause.<BR />3 For the love that I had unto them, lo, they take now my contrary
part; * but I give myself unto prayer.<BR />4 Thus have they rewarded me evil for good, * and hatred for my
good will.<BR />5 Set thou an ungodly man to be ruler over him, * and let an adversary
stand at his right hand.<BR />6 When sentence is given upon him, let him be condemned; * and
let his prayer be turned into sin.<BR />7 Let his days be few; * and let another take his office.<BR />8 Let his children be fatherless, * and his wife a widow.<BR />9 Let his children be vagabonds, and beg their bread; * let them
seek it also out of desolate places.<BR />10 Let the extortioner consume all that he hath; * and let the
stranger spoil his labour.<BR />11 Let there be no man to pity him, * nor to have compassion upon
his fatherless children.<BR />12 Let his posterity be destroyed; * and in the NEXT <!-- Start Superstats code version 7.0b.  Copyright 2008 MyComputer.com, Inc.

let his name be clean put out.<BR />13 Let the wickedness of his fathers be had in remembrance in
the sight of the LORD; * and let not the sin of his mother be
done away.<BR />14 Let them alway be before the LORD, * that he may root out the
memorial of them from off the earth;<BR />15 And that, because his mind was not to do good; * but persecuted
the poor helpless man, that he might slay him that was vexed at
the heart.<BR />16 His delight was in cursing, and it shall happen unto him; *
he loved not blessing, therefore shall it be far from him.<BR />17 He clothed himself with cursing like as with a raiment, * and
it shall come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his
bones.<BR />18 Let it be unto him as the cloak that he hath upon him, * and
as the girdle that he is alway girded withal.<BR />19 Let it thus happen from the LORD unto mine enemies, * and to
those that speak evil against my soul.<BR />20 But deal thou with me, O LORD God, according unto thy Name;
* for sweet is thy mercy.<BR />21 O deliver me, for I am helpless and poor, ~ and my heart is
wounded within me.<BR />22 I go hence like the shadow that departeth, * and am driven
away as the grasshopper.<BR />23 My knees are weak through fasting; * my flesh is dried up for
want of fatness.<BR />24 I am become also a reproach unto them: * they that look upon
me shake their heads.<BR />25 Help me, O LORD my God; * O save me according to thy mercy;<BR />26 And they shall know how that this is thy hand, * and that thou,
LORD, hast done it.<BR />27 Though they curse, yet bless thou; * and let them be confounded
that rise up against me; but let thy servant rejoice.<BR />28 Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame; * and let them
cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a cloak.<BR />29 As for me, I will give great thanks unto the LORD with my mouth,
* and praise him among the multitude;<BR />30 For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, * to save
his soul from unrighteous judges.<BR /></p><P><CENTER>The Twenty-third Day.<BR /><BR />Morning Prayer.</CENTER></p><P><B>Psalm 110. Dixit Dominus.</B><BR />THE LORD said unto my Lord, * Sit thou on my right hand, until

equity.<BR />9 He sent redemption unto his people; * he hath commanded his
covenant for ever; holy and reverend is his Name.<BR />10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; * a good understanding
have all they that do thereafter; his praise endureth for ever.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 112. Beatus vir.</B><BR />BLESSED is the man that feareth the LORD; * he hath great delight

my prayer;<BR />2 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me; * therefore will I
call upon him as long as I live.<BR />3 The snares of death compassed me round about, * and the pains
of hell gat hold upon me.<BR />4 I found trouble and heaviness; then called I upon the Name of
the LORD; * O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.<BR />5 Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; * yea, our God is merciful.<BR />6 The LORD preserveth the simple: * I was in misery, and he helped

rewarded thee.<BR />8 And why? thou hast delivered my soul from death, * mine eyes
from tears, and my feet from falling.<BR />9 I will walk before the LORD * in the land of the living.<BR />10 I believed, and therefore will I speak; but I was sore troubled:

that he hath done unto me?<BR />12 I will receive the cup of salvation, * and call upon the Name
of the LORD.<BR />13 I will pay my vows now in the presence of all his people: *

it.<BR />21 I will thank thee; for thou hast heard me, * and art become
my salvation.<BR />22 The same stone which the builders refused, * is become the

I have put my trust in thy word.<BR />75 I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, * and that thou
of very faithfulness hast caused me to be troubled.<BR />76 O let thy merciful kindness be my comfort, * according to thy
word unto thy servant.<BR />77 O let thy loving mercies come unto me, that I may live; * for
thy law is my delight.<BR />78 Let the proud be confounded, for they go wickedly about to
destroy me; * but I will be occupied in thy commandments.<BR />79 Let such as fear thee, and have known thy testimonies, * be
turned unto me.<BR />80 O let my heart be sound in thy statutes, * that I be not ashamed.<BR /><BR /><BR />XI. Defecit anima mea.<BR />MY soul hath longed for thy salvation, * and I have a good hope
because of thy word.<BR />82 Mine eyes-long sore for thy word; * saying, O when wilt thou
comfort me?<BR />83 For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; * yet do I not
forget thy statutes.<BR />84 How many are the days of thy servant? * when wilt thou be avenged
of them that persecute me?<BR />85 The proud have digged pits for me, * which are not after thy

the testimonies of thy mouth.<BR /><BR /><BR />XII. In aeternum, Domine.<BR />O LORD, thy word * endureth for ever in heaven. go Thy truth also
remaineth from one generation to another; * thou hast laid the
foundation of the earth, and it abideth.<BR />91 They continue this day according to thine ordinance; * for
all things serve thee.<BR />92 If my delight had not been in thy law, * I should have perished
in my trouble.<BR />93 I will never forget thy commandments; * for with them thou
hast quickened me.<BR />94 I am thine: O save me, * for I have sought thy commandments.<BR />95 The ungodly laid wait for me, to destroy me; * but I will consider
thy testimonies.<BR />96 I see that all things come to an end; * but thy commandment
is exceeding broad.<BR /><BR /><BR />XIII. Quomodo dilexi!<BR />LORD, what love have I unto thy law! * all the day long is my
study in it.<BR />98 Thou, through thy commandments, hast made me wiser than mine
enemies; * for they are ever with me.<BR />99 I have more understanding than my teachers; * for thy testimonies
are my study.<BR />100 I am wiser than the aged; * because I keep thy commandments.<BR />101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, * that I may
keep thy word.<BR />102 I have not shrunk from thy judgments; * for thou teachest

to thy word.<BR />108 Let the free-will offerings of my mouth please thee, O LORD;
* and teach me thy judgments.<BR />109 My soul is alway in my hand; * yet do I not forget thy law.<BR />110 The ungodly have laid a snare for me; * but yet I swerved
not from thy commandments.<BR />111 Thy testimonies have I claimed as mine heritage for ever;

unto the end.<BR /><BR /><BR />XV. Iniquos odio habui.<BR />I HATE them that imagine evil things; * but thy law do I love.<BR />114 Thou art my defence and shield; * and my trust is in thy word.<BR />115 Away from me, ye wicked; * I will keep the commandments of
my God.<BR />116 O stablish me according to thy word, that I may live; * and
let me not be disappointed of my hope.<BR />117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe; * yea, my delight shall

thy judgments.<BR /><BR /><BR />XVI. Feci judicium.<BR />I DEAL with the thing that is lawful and right; * O give me not
over unto mine oppressors.<BR />122 Make thou thy servant to delight in that which is good, *
that the proud do me no wrong.<BR />123 Mine eyes are wasted away with looking for thy health, * and
for the word of thy righteousness.<BR />124 O deal with thy servant according unto thy loving mercy, *
and teach me thy statutes.<BR />125 I am thy servant; O grant me understanding, * that I may know
thy testimonies.<BR />126 It is time for thee, LORD, to lay to thine hand; * for they
have destroyed thy law.<BR />127 For I love thy commandments * above gold and precious stones.<BR />128 Therefore hold I straight all thy commandments; * and all
false ways I utterly abhor.<BR /><BR /><BR />XVII. Mirabilia.<BR />THY testimonies are wonderful; * therefore doth my soul keep them.<BR />130 When thy word goeth forth, * it giveth light and understanding
unto the simple.<BR />131 I opened my mouth, and drew in my breath; * for my delight

and true.<BR />139 My zeal hath even consumed me; * because mine enemies have
forgotten thy words.<BR />140 Thy word is tried to the uttermost, * and thy servant loveth
it.<BR />141 I am small and of no reputation; * yet do I not forget thy
commandments.<BR />142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, * and thy
law is the truth.<BR />143 Trouble and heaviness have taken hold upon me; * yet is my
delight in thy commandments.<BR />144 The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: * O grant

tongue.<BR />3 What reward shall be given or done unto thee, thou false tongue?
* even mighty and sharp arrows, with hot burning coals.<BR />4 Woe is me, that I am constrained to dwell with Meshech, * and
to have my habitation among the tents of Kedar!<BR />5 My soul hath long dwelt among them * that are enemies unto peace.<BR />6 I labour for peace; but when I speak unto them thereof, * they
make them ready to battle.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 121. Levavi oculos.</B><BR />I WILL lift up mine eyes unto the hills; * from whence cometh
my help?<BR />2 My help cometh even from the LORD, * who hath made heaven and
earth.<BR />3 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved; * and he that keepeth

like unto them that dream.<BR />2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, * and our tongue with
joy.<BR />3 Then said they among the heathen, * The LORD hath done great
things for them.<BR />4 Yea, the LORD hath done great things for us already; * whereof
we rejoice.<BR />5 Turn our captivity, O LORD, * as the rivers in the south.<BR />6 They that sow in tears * shall reap in joy.<BR />7 He that now goeth on his way weeping, and beareth forth good

Israel now say;<BR />2 Yea, many a time have they vexed me from my youth up; * but

up into my bed;<BR />4 I will not suffer mine eyes to sleep, nor mine eyelids to slumber;
* neither the temples of my head to take any rest;<BR />5 Until I find out a place for the temple of the LORD; * an habitation
for the Mighty God of Jacob.<BR />6 Lo, we heard of the same at Ephratah, * and found it in the

the sum of them!<BR />18 If I tell them, they are more in number than the sand: * when
I wake up, I am present with thee.<BR />19 Wilt thou not slay the wicked, O God? * Depart from me, ye
blood-thirsty men.<BR />20 For they speak unrighteously against thee; * and thine enemies
take thy Name in vain.<BR />21 Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? * and am not I
grieved with those that rise up against thee?<BR />22 Yea, I hate them right sore; * even as though they were mine
enemies.<BR />23 Try me, O God, and seek the ground of my heart; * prove me,
and examine my thoughts.<BR />24 Look well if there be any way of wickedness in me; * and lead
me in the way everlasting.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 140. Eripe me, Domine.</B><BR />DELIVER me, O LORD, from the evil man; * and preserve me from
the wicked man;<BR />2 Who imagine mischief in their hearts, * and stir up strife all
the day long.<BR />3 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; * adder's
poison is under their lips.<BR />4 Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the ungodly; * preserve me
from the wicked men, who are purposed to overthrow my goings.<BR />5 The proud have laid a snare for me, and spread a net abroad
with cords; * yea, and set traps in my way.<BR />6 I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God, * hear the voice of my
prayers, O LORD.<BR />7 O LORD God, thou strength of my health; * thou hast covered
my head in the day of battle.<BR />8 Let not the ungodly have his desire, O LORD; * let not his mischievous
imagination prosper, lest they be too proud.<BR />9 Let the mischief of their own lips fall upon the head of them
* that compass me about.<BR />10 Let hot burning coals fall upon them; * let them be cast into
the fire, and into the pit, that they never rise up again.<BR />11 A man full of words shall not prosper upon the earth: * evil
shall hunt the wicked person to overthrow him.<BR />12 Sure I am that the LORD will avenge the poor, * and maintain
the cause of the helpless.<BR />13 The righteous also shall give thanks unto thy Name; * and the
just shall continue in thy sight.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 141. Domine, clamavi.</B><BR />LORD, I call upon thee; haste thee unto me, * and consider my
voice, when I cry unto thee.<BR />2 Let my prayer be set forth in thy sight as the incense; * and
let the lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice.<BR />3 Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth, * and keep the door of
my lips.<BR />4 O let not mine heart be inclined to any evil thing; * let me
not be occupied in ungodly works with the men that work wickedness,
neither let me eat of such things as please them.<BR />5 Let the righteous rather smite me friendly, and reprove me;
* yea, let not my head refuse their precious balms.<BR />6 As for the ungodly, * I will pray yet against their wickedness.<BR />7 Let their judges be overthrown in stony places, * that they
may hear my words; for they are sweet.<BR />8 Our bones lie scattered before the pit, * like as when one breaketh
and heweth wood upon the earth.<BR />9 But mine eyes look unto thee, O LORD God; * in thee is my trust;
O cast not out my soul.<BR />10 Keep me from the snare that they have laid for me, * and from
the traps of the wicked doers.<BR />11 Let the ungodly fall into their own nets together, * and let
me ever escape them.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 142. Voce mea ad Dominum.</B><BR />I CRIED unto the LORD with my voice; * yea, even unto the LORD
did I make my supplication.<BR />2 I poured out my complaints before him, * and showed him of my
trouble.<BR />3 When my spirit was in heaviness, thou knewest my path; * in
the way wherein I walked, have they privily laid a snare for me.<BR />4 I looked also upon my right hand, * and saw there was no man
that would know me.<BR />5 I had no place to flee unto, * and no man cared for my soul.<BR />6 I cried unto thee, O LORD, and said, * Thou art my hope, and
my portion in the land of the living.<BR />7 Consider my complaint; * for I am brought very low.<BR />8 O deliver me from my persecutors; * for they are too strong
for me.<BR />9 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks unto thy
Name; * which thing if thou wilt grant me, then shall the righteous
resort unto my company.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 143. Domine, exaudi.</B><BR />HEAR my prayer, O LORD, and consider my desire; * hearken unto
me for thy truth and righteousness' sake.<BR />2 And enter not into judgment with thy servant; * for in thy sight
shall no man living be justified.<BR />3 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life
down to the ground; * he hath laid me in the darkness, as the
men that have been long dead.<BR />4 Therefore is my spirit vexed within me, * and my heart within
me is desolate.<BR />5 Yet do I remember the time past; I muse upon all thy works;
* yea, I exercise myself in the works of thy hands.<BR />6 I stretch forth my hands unto thee; * my soul gaspeth unto thee
as a thirsty land.<BR />7 Hear me, O LORD, and that soon; for my spirit waxeth faint:
* hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go
down into the pit.<BR />8 O let me hear thy loving-kindness betimes in the morning; for
in thee is my trust: * show thou me the way that I should walk
in; for I lift up my soul unto thee.<BR />9 Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies; * for I flee unto thee
to hide me.<BR />10 Teach me to do the thing that pleaseth thee; for thou art my
God: * let thy loving Spirit lead me forth into the land of righteousness.<BR />11 Quicken me, O LORD, for thy Name's sake; * and for thy righteousness'
sake bring my soul out of trouble.<BR />12 And of thy goodness slay mine enemies, * and destroy all them
that vex my soul; for I am thy servant.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 144. Benedictus Dominus.</B><BR />BLESSED be the LORD my strength, * who teacheth my hands to war,
and my fingers to fight:<BR />2 My hope and my fortress, my castle and deliverer, my defender
in whom I trust; * who subdueth my people that is under me.<BR />3 LORD, what is man, that thou hast such respect unto him? * or
the son of man, that thou so regardest him?<BR />4 Man is like a thing of nought; * his time passeth away like
a shadow.<BR />5 Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down; * touch the mountains,
and they shall smoke.<BR />6 Cast forth thy lightning, and tear them; * shoot out thine arrows,
and consume them.<BR />7 Send down thine hand from above; * deliver me, and take me out
of the great waters, from the hand of strangers;<BR />8 Whose mouth talketh of vanity, * and their right hand is a right
hand of wickedness.<BR />9 I will sing a new song unto thee, O God; * and sing praises
unto thee upon a ten-stringed lute.<BR />10 Thou hast given victory unto kings, * and hast delivered David
thy servant from the peril of the sword.<BR />11 Save me, and deliver me from the hand of strangers, * whose
mouth talketh of vanity, and their right hand is a right hand
of iniquity:<BR />12 That our sons may grow up as the young plants, * and that our
daughters may be as the polished corners of the temple;<BR />13 That our garners may be full and plenteous with all manner
of store; * that our sheep may bring forth thousands, and ten
thousands in our fields;<BR />14 That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no decay,
* no leading into captivity, and no complaining in our streets.<BR />15 Happy are the people that are in such a case; * yea, blessed
are the people who have the LORD for their God.<BR /><B><BR /><BR />Psalm 145. Exaltabo te, Deus.</B><BR />I WILL magnify thee, O God, my King; * and I will praise thy Name
for ever and ever.<BR />2 Every day will I give thanks unto thee; * and praise thy Name
for ever and ever.<BR />3 Great is the LORD, and marvellous worthy to be praised; * there
is no end of his greatness.<BR />4 One generation shall praise thy works unto another, * and declare
thy power.<BR />5 As for me, I will be talking of thy worship, * thy glory, thy
praise, and wondrous works;<BR />6 So that men shall speak of the might of thy marvellous acts;
* and I will also tell of thy greatness.<BR />7 The memorial of thine abundant kindness shall be showed; * and
men shall sing of thy righteousness.<BR />8 The LORD is gracious and merciful; * long-suffering, and of
great goodness.<BR />9 The LORD is loving unto every man; * and his mercy is over all
his works.<BR />10 All thy works praise thee, O LORD; * and thy saints give thanks
unto thee.<BR />11 They show the glory of thy kingdom, * and talk of thy power;<BR />12 That thy power, thy glory, and mightiness of thy kingdom, *
might be known unto men.<BR />13 Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, * and thy dominion endureth
throughout all ages.<BR />14 The LORD upholdeth all such as fall, * and lifteth up all those
that are down.<BR />15 The eyes of all wait upon thee, O Lord; * and thou givest them
their meat in due season.<BR />16 Thou openest thine hand, * and fillest all things living with
plenteousness.<BR />17 The LORD is righteous in all his ways, * and holy in all his
works.<BR />18 The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him; * yea, all
such as call upon him faithfully.<BR />19 He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him; * he also
will hear their cry, and will help them.<BR />20 The LORD preserveth all them that love him; * but scattereth
abroad all the ungodly.<BR />21 My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD; * and let all
flesh give thanks unto his holy Name for ever and ever.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 146. Lauda, anima mea.</B><BR />PRAISE the LORD, O my soul: while I live, will I praise the LORD;
* yea, as long as I have any being, I will sing praises unto my
God.<BR />2 O put not your trust in princes, nor in any child of man; *
for there is no help in them.<BR />3 For when the breath of man goeth forth, he shall turn again
to his earth, * and then all his thoughts perish.<BR />4 Blessed is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, * and
whose hope is in the LORD his God:<BR />5 Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that therein is;
* who keepeth his promise for ever;<BR />6 Who helpeth them to right that suffer wrong; * who feedeth the
hungry.<BR />7 The LORD looseth men out of prison; * the LORD giveth sight
to the blind.<BR />8 The LORD helpeth them that are fallen; * the LORD careth for
the righteous.<BR />9 The LORD careth for the strangers; he defendeth the fatherless
and widow: * as for the way of the ungodly, he turneth it upside
down.<BR />10 The LORD thy God, O Sion, shall be King for evermore, * and
throughout all generations.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 147. Laudate Dominum.</B><BR />PRAISE the LORD, for it is a good thing to sing praises unto our
God; * yea, a joyful and pleasant thing it is to be thankful.<BR />2 The LORD doth build up Jerusalem, * and gather together the
outcasts of Israel.<BR />3 He healeth those that are broken in heart, * and giveth medicine
to heal their sickness.<BR />4 He telleth the number of the stars, * and calleth them all by
their names.<BR />5 Great is our Lord, and great is his power; * yea, and his wisdom
is infinite.<BR />6 The LORD setteth up the meek, * and bringeth the ungodly down
to the ground.<BR />7 O sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; * sing praises upon
the harp unto our God:<BR />8 Who covereth the heaven with clouds, and prepareth rain for
the earth; * and maketh the grass to grow upon the mountains,
and herb for the use of men;<BR />9 Who giveth fodder unto the cattle, * and feedeth the young ravens
that call upon him.<BR />10 He hath no pleasure in the strength of an horse; * neither
delighteth he in any man's legs.<BR />11 But the LORD'S delight is in them that fear him, * and put
their trust in his mercy. ~<BR />12 Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; * praise thy God, O Sion.<BR />13 For he hath made fast the bars of thy gates, * and hath blessed
thy children within thee.<BR />14 He maketh peace in thy borders, * and filleth thee with the
flour of wheat.<BR />15 He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth, * and his word
runneth very swiftly.<BR />16 He giveth snow like wool, * and scattereth the hoarfrost like
ashes.<BR />17 He casteth forth his ice like morsels: * who is able to abide
his frost?<BR />18 He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: * he bloweth with
his wind, and the waters flow.<BR />19 He showeth his word unto Jacob, * his statutes and ordinances
unto Israel.<BR />20 He hath not dealt so with any nation; * neither have the heathen
knowledge of his laws.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 148. Laudate Dominum.</B><BR />O PRAISE the LORD from the heavens: * praise him in the heights.<BR />2 Praise him, all ye angels of his: * praise him, all his host.<BR />3 Praise him, sun and moon: * praise him, all ye stars and light.<BR />4 Praise him, all ye heavens, * and ye waters that are above the
heavens.<BR />5 Let them praise the Name of the LORD: * for he spake the word,
and they were made; he commanded, and they were created.<BR />6 He hath made them fast for ever and ever: * he hath given them
a law which shall not be broken.<BR />7 Praise the LORD from the earth, * ye dragons and all deeps;<BR />8 Fire and hail, snow and vapours, * wind and storm, fulfilling
his word;<BR />9 Mountains and all hills; * fruitful trees and all cedars;<BR />10 Beasts and all cattle; * creeping things and flying fowls;<BR />11 Kings of the earth, and all peoples; * princes, and all judges
of the world;<BR />12 Young men and maidens, old men and children, praise the Name
of the LORD: * for his Name only is excellent, and his praise
above heaven and earth.<BR />13 He shall exalt the horn of his people: all his saints shall
praise him; * even the children of Israel, even the people that
serveth him.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 149. Cantate Domino.</B><BR />O SING unto the LORD a new song; * let the congregation of saints
praise him.<BR />2 Let Israel rejoice in him that made him, * and let the children
of Sion be joyful in their King.<BR />3 Let them praise his Name in the dance: * let them sing praises
unto him with tabret and harp.<BR />4 For the LORD hath pleasure in his people, * and helpeth the
meek-hearted.<BR />5 Let the saints be joyful with glory; * let them rejoice in their
beds.<BR />6 Let the praises of God be in their mouth; * and a two-edged
sword in their hands;<BR />7 To be avenged of the nations, * and to rebuke the peoples;<BR />8 To bind their kings in chains, * and their nobles with links
of iron;<BR />9 To execute judgment upon them; as it is written, * Such honour
have all his saints.<BR /><BR /><B><BR />Psalm 150. Laudate Dominum.</B><BR />O PRAISE God in his sanctuary: * praise him in the firmament of
his power.<BR />2 Praise him in his noble acts: * praise him according to his
excellent greatness.<BR />3 Praise him in the sound of the trumpet: * praise him upon the
lute and harp.<BR />4 Praise him in the timbrels and dances: * praise him upon the
strings and pipe.<BR />5 Praise him upon the well-tuned cymbals: * praise him upon the
loud cymbals.<BR />6 Let every thing that hath breath * praise the LORD.<BR /></p><P><CENTER>The End of the Psalter.<BR />Go to <A HREF="../index.html">1928 Book of Common Prayer</A></CENTER>
