    <p><strong>Psalm 15. Domine, quis habitabit?</strong><br />
      LORD, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? * or who shall rest upon thy holy hill?<br />
      2 Even he that leadeth an uncorrupt life, * and doeth the thing which is right, and speaketh the truth from his heart.<br />
      3 He that hath used no deceit in his tongue, nor done evil to his neighbour, * and hath not slandered his neighbour.<br />
      4 He that setteth not by himself, but is lowly in his own eyes, * and maketh much of them that fear the LORD.<br />
      5 He that sweareth unto his neighbour, and disappointeth him not, * though it were to his own hindrance.<br />
      6 He that hath not given his money upon usury, * nor taken reward against the innocent.<br />
      7 Whoso doeth these things * shall never fall.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 16. Conserva me, Domine.</strong><br />
      PRESERVE me, O God; * for in thee have I put my trust.<br />
      2 O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, * Thou art my God; I have no good like unto thee.<br />
      3 All my delight is upon the saints that are in the earth, * and upon such as excel in virtue.<br />
      4 But they that run after another god * shall have great trouble.<br />
      5 Their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, * neither make mention of their names within my lips.<br />
      6 The LORD himself is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup; * thou shalt maintain my lot.<br />
      7 The lot is fallen unto me in a fair ground; * yea, I have a goodly heritage.<br />
      8 I will thank the LORD for giving me warning; * my reins also chasten me in the night season.<br />
      9 I have set the LORD alway before me; * for he is on my right hand, therefore I shall not fall.<br />
      10 Wherefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: * my flesh also shall rest in hope.<br />
      11 For why? thou shalt not leave my soul in hell; * neither shalt thou suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.<br />
      12 Thou shalt show me the path of life: in thy presence is the fulness of joy, * and at thy right hand there is pleasure for evermore.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 17. Exaudi, Domine.</strong><br />
      HEAR the right, O LORD, consider my complaint, * and hearken unto my prayer, that goeth not out-of feigned lips.<br />
      2 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; * and let thine eyes look upon the thing that is equal.<br />
      3 Thou hast proved and visited mine heart in the night season; thou hast tried me, and shalt find no wickedness in me; * for I am utterly purposed that my mouth shall not offend.<br />
      4 As for the works of men, * by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the ways of the destroyer.<br />
      5 O hold thou up my goings in thy paths, * that my footsteps slip not.<br />
      6 I have called upon thee, O God, for thou shalt hear me: * incline thine ear to me, and hearken unto my words.<br />
      7 Show thy marvellous loving-kindness, thou that art the Saviour of them which put their trust in thee, * from such as resist thy right hand.<br />
      8 Keep me as the apple of an eye; * hide me under the shadow of thy wings,<br />
      9 From the ungodly, that trouble me; * mine enemies compass me round about, to take away my soul.<br />
      10 They are inclosed in their own fat, * and their mouth speaketh proud things.<br />
      11 They lie waiting in our way on every side, * watching to cast us down to the ground;<br />
      12 Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, * and as it were a lion's whelp lurking in secret places.<br />
      13 Up, LORD, disappoint him, and cast him down; * deliver my soul from the ungodly, by thine own sword;<br />
      14 Yea, by thy hand, O LORD; from the men of the evil world; * which have their portion in this life, whose bellies thou fillest with thy hid treasure.<br />
      15 They have children at their desire, * and leave the rest of their substance for their babes.<br />
    16 But as for me, I shall behold thy presence in righteousness; * and when I awake up after thy likeness, I shall be satisfied.
