    <p><strong>Psalm 119. (Cont)<br />
      XIX. Clamavi in toto corde meo.</strong><br />
      I CALL with my whole heart; * hear me, O LORD; I will keep thy statutes.<br />
      146 Yea, even unto thee do I call; * help me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.<br />
      147 Early in the morning do I cry unto thee; * for in thy word is my trust.<br />
      148 Mine eyes prevent the night watches; * that I might be occupied in thy word.<br />
      149 Hear my voice, O LORD, according unto thy lovingkindness; * quicken me, according to thy judgments.<br />
      150 They draw nigh that of malice persecute me, * and are far from thy law.<br />
      151 Be thou nigh at hand, O LORD; * for all thy commandments are true.<br />
      152 As concerning thy testimonies, I have known long since, * that thou hast grounded them for ever.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>XX. Vide humilitatem.</strong><br />
      O CONSIDER mine adversity, and deliver me, * for I do not forget thy law.<br />
      154 Avenge thou my cause, and deliver me; * quicken me according to thy word.<br />
      155 Health is far from the ungodly; * for they regard not thy statutes.<br />
      156 Great is thy mercy, O LORD; * quicken me, as thou art wont.<br />
      157 Many there are that trouble me, and persecute me; * yet do I not swerve from thy testimonies.<br />
      158 It grieveth me when I see the transgressors; * because they keep not thy law.<br />
      159 Consider, O LORD, how I love thy commandments; * O quicken me, according to thy loving-kindness.<br />
      160 Thy word is true from everlasting; * all the judgments of thy righteousness endure for evermore.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>XXI. Principes persecuti sunt.</strong><br />
      PRINCES have persecuted me without a cause; * but my heart standeth in awe of thy word.<br />
      162 I am as glad of thy word, * as one that findeth great spoils.<br />
      163 As for lies, I hate and abhor them; * but thy law do I love.<br />
      164 Seven times a day do I praise thee; * because of thy righteous judgments.<br />
      165 Great is the peace that they have who love thy law; * and they have none occasion of stumbling.<br />
      166 LORD, I have looked for thy saving health, * and done after thy commandments.<br />
      167 My soul hath kept thy testimonies, * and loved them exceedingly.<br />
      168 I have kept thy commandments and testimonies; * for all my ways are before thee.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>XXII. Appropinquet deprecatio.</strong><br />
      LET my complaint come before thee, O LORD; * give me understanding according to thy word.<br />
      170 Let my supplication come before thee; * deliver me according to thy word.<br />
      171 My lips shall speak of thy praise, * when thou hast taught me thy statutes.<br />
      172 Yea, my tongue shall sing of thy word; * for all thy commandments are righteous.<br />
      173 Let thine hand help me; * for I have chosen thy commandments.<br />
      174 I have longed for thy saving health, O LORD; * and in thy law is my delight.<br />
      175 O let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; * and thy judgments shall help me.<br />
    176 I have gone astray like a sheep that is lost; * O seek thy servant, for I do not forget thy commandments.
