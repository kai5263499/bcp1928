      The Nineteenth Day.<BR>
<BR>
      Morning Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 95. Venite, exultemus.</B><BR>
      O COME, let us sing unto the LORD; * let us heartily rejoice
      in the strength of our salvation.<BR>
      2 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving; * and show
      ourselves glad in him with psalms.<BR>
      3 For the LORD is a great God; * and a great King above all gods.<BR>
      4 In his hand are all the corners of the earth; * and the strength
      of the hills is his also.<BR>
      5 The sea is his, and he made it; * and his hands prepared the
      dry land.<BR>
      6 O come, let us worship and fall down, * and kneel before the
      LORD our Maker.<BR>
      7 For he is the Lord our God; * and we are the people of his
      pasture, and the sheep of his hand.<BR>
      8 To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts *
      as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the
      wilderness;<BR>
      9 When your fathers tempted me, * proved me, and saw my works.<BR>
      10 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said,
      * It is a people that do err in their hearts, for they have not
      known my ways:<BR>
      11 Unto whom I sware in my wrath, * that they should not enter
      into my rest.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 96. Cantate Domino.</B><BR>
      O SING unto the LORD a new song; * sing unto the LORD, all the
      whole earth.<BR>
      2 Sing unto the LORD, and praise his Name; * be telling of his
      salvation from day to day.<BR>
      3 Declare his honour unto the heathen, * and his wonders unto
      all peoples.<BR>
      4 For the LORD is great, and cannot worthily be praised;* he
      is more to be feared than all gods.<BR>
      5 As for all the gods of the heathen, they are but idols; * but
      it is the LORD that made the heavens.<BR>
      6 Glory and worship are before him; * power and honour are in
      his sanctuary.<BR>
      7 Ascribe unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the peoples, * ascribe
      unto the LORD worship and power.<BR>
      8 Ascribe unto the LORD the honour due unto his Name; * bring
      presents, and come into his courts.<BR>
      9 O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness; * let the whole
      earth stand in awe of him.<BR>
      10 Tell it out among the heathen, that the LORD is King, and
      that it is he who hath made the round world so fast that it cannot
      be moved; * and how that he shall judge the peoples righteously.<BR>
      11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; * let
      the sea make a noise, and all that therein is.<BR>
      12 Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it; * then shall
      all the trees of the wood rejoice before the LORD.<BR>
      13 For he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth; * and with
      righteousness to judge the world, and the peoples with his truth.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 97. Dominus regnavit.</B><BR>
      THE LORD is King, the earth may be glad thereof; * yea, the multitude
      of the isles may be glad thereof.<BR>
      2 Clouds and darkness are round about him: * righteousness and
      judgment are the habitation of his seat.<BR>
      3 There shall go a fire before him, * and burn up his enemies
      on every side.<BR>
      4 His lightnings gave shine unto the world: * the earth saw it,
      and was afraid.<BR>
      5 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD; * at
      the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.<BR>
      6 The heavens have declared his righteousness, * and all the
      peoples have seen his glory.<BR>
      7 Confounded be all they that worship carved images, and that
      delight in vain gods: * worship him, all ye gods.<BR>
      8 Sion heard of it, and rejoiced; and the daughters of Judah
      were glad, * because of thy judgments, O LORD.<BR>
      9 For thou, LORD, art higher than all that are in the earth:
      * thou art exalted far above all gods.<BR>
      10 O ye that love the LORD, see that ye hate the thing which
      is evil: * the Lord preserveth the souls of his saints; he shall
      deliver them from the hand of the ungodly.<BR>
      11 There is sprung up a light for the righteous, * and joyful
      gladness for such as are true-hearted.<BR>
      12 Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; * and give thanks for a
      remembrance of his holiness.<BR>

      <P><B>Psalm 98. Cantate Domino</B>.<BR>
      O SING unto the LORD a new song; * for he hath done marvellous
      things.<BR>
      2 With his own right hand, and with his holy arm, * hath he gotten
      himself the victory.<BR>
      3 The LORD declared his salvation; * his righteousness hath he
      openly showed in the sight of the heathen.<BR>
      4 He hath remembered his mercy and truth toward the house of
      Israel; * and all the ends of the world have seen the salvation
      of our God.<BR>
      5 Show yourselves joyful unto the LORD, all ye lands; * sing,
      rejoice, and give thanks.<BR>
      6 Praise the LORD upon the harp; * sing to the harp with a psalm
      of thanksgiving.<BR>
      7 With trumpets also and shawms, * O show yourselves joyful before
      the LORD, the King.<BR>
      8 Let the sea make a noise, and all that therein is; * the round
      world, and they that dwell therein.<BR>
      9 Let the floods clap their hands, and let the hills be joyful
      together before the LORD; * for he is come to judge the earth.<BR>
      10 With righteousness shall he judge the world, * and the peoples
      with equity.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 99. Dominus regnavit.</B><BR>
      THE LORD is King, be the people never so impatient; * he sitteth
      between the Cherubim, be the earth never so unquiet.<BR>
      2 The LORD is great in Sion, * and high above all people.<BR>
      3 They shall give thanks unto thy Name, * which is great, wonderful,
      and holy.<BR>
      4 The King's power loveth judgment; thou hast prepared equity,
      * thou hast executed judgment and righteousness in Jacob.<BR>
      5 O magnify the LORD our God, and fall down before his footstool;
      * for he is holy.<BR>
      6 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among such as
      call upon his Name: * these called upon the LORD, and he heard
      them.<BR>
      7 He spake unto them out of the cloudy pillar; * for they kept
      his testimonies, and the law that he gave them.<BR>
      8 Thou heardest them, O LORD our God; * thou forgavest them,
      O God, though thou didst punish their wicked doings.<BR>
      9 O magnify the LORD our God, and worship him upon his holy hill;
      * for the LORD our God is holy.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 100. Jubilate Deo.</B><BR>
      O BE joyful in the LORD, all ye lands: * serve the LORD with
      gladness, and come before his presence with a song.<BR>
      2 Be ye sure that the LORD he is God; it is he that hath made
      us, and not we ourselves; * we are his people, and the sheep
      of his pasture.<BR>
      3 O go your way into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his
      courts with praise; * be thankful unto him, and speak good of
      his Name.<BR>
      4 For the LORD is gracious, his mercy is everlasting; * and his
      truth endureth from generation to generation.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 101. Misericordiam et judicium.</B><BR>
      MY song shall be of mercy and judgment; * unto thee, O LORD,
      will I sing.<BR>
      2 O let me have understanding * in the way of godliness!<BR>
      3 When wilt thou come unto me? * I will walk in my house with
      a perfect heart.<BR>
      4 I will take no wicked thing in hand; I hate the sins of unfaithfulness;
      * there shall no such cleave unto me.<BR>
      5 A froward heart shall depart from me; * I will not know a wicked
      person.<BR>
      6 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, * him will I destroy.<BR>
      7 Whoso hath also a haughty look and a proud heart, * I will
      not suffer him.<BR>
      8 Mine eyes look upon such as are faithful in the land, * that
      they may dwell with me.<BR>
      9 Whoso leadeth a godly life, * he shall be my servant.<BR>
      10 There shall no deceitful person dwell in my house; * he that
      telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.<BR>
      11 I shall soon destroy all the ungodly that are in the land;
      * that I may root out all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.<BR>
