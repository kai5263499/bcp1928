      <P><B>Psalms 2. Quare fremuerunt gentes?</B><BR>
      WHY do the heathen so furiously rage together? * and why do the
      people imagine a vain thing?<BR>
      2 The kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take counsel
      together * against the LORD, and against his Anointed:<BR>
      3 Let us break their bonds asunder, * and cast away their cords
      from us.<BR>
      4 He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh them to scorn: * the
      Lord shall have them in derision.<BR>
      5 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, * and vex them
      in his sore displeasure:<BR>
      6 Yet have I set my King * upon my holy hill of Sion.<BR>
      7 I will rehearse the decree; * the LORD hath said unto me, Thou
      art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.<BR>
      8 Desire of me, and I shall give thee the nations for thine inheritance,
      * and the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession.<BR>
      9 Thou shalt bruise them with a rod of iron, * and break them
      in pieces like a potter's vessel.<BR>
      10 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings; * be instructed, ye that
      are judges of the earth.<BR>
      11 Serve the LORD in fear, * and rejoice unto him with reverence.<BR>
      12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and so ye perish from the
      right way, if his wrath be kindled, yea but a little. * Blessed
      are all they that put their trust in him.
