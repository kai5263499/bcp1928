      <P><B>Psalms 18. Diligam te, Domine.</B><BR>
      I WILL love thee, O LORD, my strength. * The LORD is my stony
      rock, and my defence;<BR>
      2 My Saviour, my God, and my might, in whom I will trust; * my
      buckler, the horn also of my salvation, and my refuge.<BR>
      3 I will call upon the LORD, which is worthy to be praised; *
      so shall I be safe from mine enemies.<BR>
      4 The sorrows of death compassed me, * and the overflowings of
      ungodliness made me afraid.<BR>
      5 The pains of hell came about me; * the snares of death overtook
      me.<BR>
      6 In my trouble I called upon the LORD, * and complained unto
      my God:<BR>
      7 So he heard my voice out of his holy temple, * and my complaint
      came before him; it entered even into his ears.<BR>
      8 The earth trembled and quaked, * the very foundations also
      of the hills shook, and were removed, because he was wroth.<BR>
      9 There went a smoke out in his presence, * and a consuming fire
      out of his mouth, so that coals were kindled at it.<BR>
      10 He bowed the heavens also, and came down, * and it was dark
      under his feet.<BR>
      11 He rode upon the Cherubim, and did fly; * he came flying upon
      the wings of the wind.<BR>
      12 He made darkness his secret place, * his pavilion round about
      him with dark water, and thick clouds to cover him.<BR>
      13 At the brightness of his presence his clouds removed; * hailstones
      and coals of fire.<BR>
      14 The LORD also thundered out of heaven, and the Highest gave
      his thunder; * hailstones and coals of fire.<BR>
      15 He sent out his arrows, and scattered them; * he cast forth
      lightnings, and destroyed them.<BR>
      16 The springs of waters were seen, and the foundations of the
      round world were discovered, * at thy chiding, O LORD, at the
      blasting of the breath of thy displeasure.<BR>
      17 He sent down from on high to fetch me, * and took me out of
      many waters.<BR>
      18 He delivered me from my strongest enemy, and from them which
      hate me; * for they were too mighty for me.<BR>
      19 They came upon me in the day of my trouble; * but the LORD
      was my upholder.<BR>
      20 He brought me forth also into a place of liberty; * he brought
      me forth, even because he had a favour unto me.<BR>
      <A NAME="anchor76453"></A>21 The LORD rewarded me after my righteous
      dealing, * according to the cleanness of my hands did he recompense
      me.<BR>
      22 Because I have kept the ways of the LORD, * and have not forsaken
      my God, as the wicked doth.<BR>
      23 For I have an eye unto all his laws, * and will not cast out
      his commandments from me.<BR>
      24 I was also uncorrupt before him, * and eschewed mine own wickedness.<BR>
      25 Therefore the LORD rewarded me after my righteous dealing,
      * and according unto the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.<BR>
      26 With the holy thou shalt be holy, * and with a perfect man
      thou shalt be perfect.<BR>
      27 With the clean thou shalt be clean, * and with the froward
      thou shalt be froward.<BR>
      28 For thou shalt save the people that are in adversity, and
      shalt bring down the high looks of the proud.<BR>
      29 Thou also shalt light my candle; * the LORD my God shall make
      my darkness to be light.<BR>
      30 For in thee I shall discomfit an host of men, * and with the
      help of my God I shall leap over the wall.<BR>
      31 The way of God is an undefiled way: * the word of the LORD
      also is tried in the fire; he is the defender of all them that
      put their trust in him.<BR>
      32 For who is God, but the LORD? * or who hath any strength,
      except our God?<BR>
      33 It is God that girdeth me with strength of war, * and maketh
      my way perfect.<BR>
      34 He maketh my feet like harts' feet, * and setteth me up on
      high.<BR>
      35 He teacheth mine hands to fight, * and mine arms shall bend
      even a bow of steel.<BR>
      36 Thou hast given me the defence of thy salvation; * thy right
      hand also shall hold me up, and thy loving correction shall make
      me great.<BR>
      37 Thou shalt make room enough under me for to go, * that my
      footsteps shall not slide.<BR>
      38 I will follow upon mine enemies, and overtake them; * neither
      will I turn again till I have destroyed them.<BR>
      39 I will smite them, that they shall not be able to stand, *
      but fall under my feet.<BR>
      40 Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle; * thou
      shalt throw down mine enemies under me.<BR>
      41 Thou hast made mine enemies also to turn their backs upon
      me, * and I shall destroy them that hate me.<BR>
      42 They shall cry, but there shall be none to help them; * yea,
      even unto the LORD shall they cry, but he shall not hear them.<BR>
      43 I will beat them as small as the dust before the wind: * I
      will cast them out as the clay in the streets.<BR>
      44 Thou shalt deliver me from the strivings of the people, *
      and thou shalt make me the head of the nations; a people whom
      I have not known shall serve me.<BR>
      45 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me; * the strangers
      shall feign obedience unto me.<BR>
      46 The strangers shall fail, * and come trembling out of their
      strongholds.<BR>
      47 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my strong helper, * and praised
      be the God of my salvation;<BR>
      48 Even the God that seeth that I be avenged, * and subdueth
      the people unto me.<BR>
      49 It is he that delivereth me from my cruel enemies, and setteth
      me up above mine adversaries: * thou shalt rid me from the wicked
      man.<BR>
      50 For this cause will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among
      the Gentiles, * and sing praises unto thy Name.<BR>
      51 Great prosperity giveth he unto his King, * and showeth loving-kindness
      unto David his anointed, and unto his seed for evermore.
