      <P><B>Psalm 102. Domine, exaudi.</B><BR>
      HEAR my prayer, O LORD, * and let my crying come unto thee.<BR>
      2 Hide not thy face from me in the time of my trouble; * incline
      thine ear unto me when I call; O hear me, and that right soon.<BR>
      3 For my days are consumed away like smoke, * and my bones are
      burnt up as it were a firebrand.<BR>
      4 My heart is smitten down, and withered like grass; * so that
      I forget to eat my bread.<BR>
      5 For the voice of my groaning, * my bones will scarce cleave
      to my flesh.<BR>
      6 I am become like a pelican in the wilderness, * and like an
      owl that is in the desert.<BR>
      7 I have watched, and am even as it were a sparrow, * that sitteth
      alone upon the housetop.<BR>
      8 Mine enemies revile me all the day long; * and they that are
      mad upon me are sworn together against me.<BR>
      9 For I have eaten ashes as it were bread, * and mingled my drink
      with weeping;<BR>
      10 And that, because of thine indignation and wrath; * for thou
      hast taken me up, and cast me down.<BR>
      11 My days are gone like a shadow, * and I am withered like grass.<BR>
      12 But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever, * and thy remembrance
      throughout all generations.<BR>
      13 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Sion; * for it is time
      that thou have mercy upon her, yea, the time is come.<BR>
      14 And why? thy servants think upon her stones, * and it pitieth
      them to see her in the dust.<BR>
      <A NAME="anchor130066"></A>15 The nations shall fear thy Name,
      O LORD; * and all the kings of the earth thy majesty;<BR>
      16 When the LORD shall build up Sion, * and when his glory shall
      appear;<BR>
      17 When he turneth him unto the prayer of the poor destitute,
      * and despiseth not their desire.<BR>
      18 This shall be written for those that come after, * and the
      people which shall be born shall praise the LORD.<BR>
      19 For he hath looked down from his sanctuary; * out of the heaven
      did the LORD behold the earth;<BR>
      20 That he might hear the mournings of such as are in captivity,
      * and deliver them that are appointed unto death;<BR>
      21 That they may declare the Name of the LORD in Sion, * and
      his worship at Jerusalem;<BR>
      22 When the peoples are gathered together, * and the kingdoms
      also, to serve the LORD.<BR>
      23 He brought down my strength in my journey, * and shortened
      my days.<BR>
      24 But I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of mine
      age; * as for thy years, they endure throughout all generations.<BR>
      25 Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the
      earth, * and the heavens are the work of thy hands.<BR>
      26 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: * they all shall
      wax old as doth a garment;<BR>
      27 And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be
      changed; * but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.<BR>
      28 The children of thy servants shall continue, * and their seed
      shall stand fast in thy sight.
