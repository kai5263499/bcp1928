      <P><B>Psalm 104. Benedic, anima mea.</B><BR>
      PRAISE the LORD, O my soul: * O LORD my God, thou art become
      exceeding glorious; thou art clothed with majesty and honour.<BR>
      2 Thou deckest thyself with light as it were with a garment,
      * and spreadest out the heavens like a curtain.<BR>
      3 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters, * and maketh
      the clouds his chariot, and walketh upon the wings of the wind.<BR>
      4 He maketh his angels winds, * and his ministers a flaming fire.<BR>
      5 He laid the foundations of the earth, * that it never should
      move at any time.<BR>
      6 Thou coveredst it with the deep like as with a garment; * the
      waters stand above the hills.<BR>
      7 At thy rebuke they flee; * at the voice of thy thunder they
      haste away.<BR>
      8 They go up as high as the hills, and down to the valleys beneath;
      * even unto the place which thou hast appointed for them.<BR>
      9 Thou hast set them their bounds, which they shall not pass,
      * neither turn again to cover the earth.<BR>
      10 He sendeth the springs into the rivers, * which run among
      the hills.<BR>
      11 All beasts of the field drink thereof, * and the wild asses
      quench their thirst.<BR>
      12 Beside them shall the fowls of the air have their habitation,
      * and sing among the branches.<BR>
      13 He watereth the hills from above; * the earth is filled with
      the fruit of thy works.<BR>
      14 He bringeth forth grass for the cattle, * and green herb for
      the service of men;<BR>
      15 That he may bring food out of the earth, and wine that maketh
      glad the heart of man; * and oil to make him a cheerful countenance,
      and bread to strengthen man's heart.<BR>
      16 The trees of the LORD also are full of sap; * even the cedars
      of Lebanon which he hath planted;<BR>
      17 Wherein the birds make their nests; * and the firtrees are
      a dwelling for the stork.<BR>
      18 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; * and so are
      the stony rocks for the conies.<BR>
      19 He appointed the moon for certain seasons, * and the sun knoweth
      his going down.<BR>
      20 Thou makest darkness that it may be night; * wherein all the
      beasts of the forest do move.<BR>
      21 The lions, roaring after their prey, * do seek their meat
      from God.<BR>
      22 The sun ariseth, and they get them away together, * and lay
      them down in their dens.<BR>
      23 Man goeth forth to his work, and to his labour, * until the
      evening.<BR>
      24 O LORD, how manifold are thy works! * in wisdom hast thou
      made them all; the earth is full of thy riches.<BR>
      25 So is the great and wide sea also; * wherein are things creeping
      innumerable, both small and great beasts.<BR>
      26 There go the ships, and there is that leviathan, * whom thou
      hast made to take his pastime therein.<BR>
      27 These wait all upon thee, * that thou mayest give them meat
      in due season.<BR>
      28 When thou givest it them, they gather it; * and when thou
      openest thy hand, they are filled with good.<BR>
      29 When thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: * when thou
      takest away their breath, they die, and are turned again to their
      dust.<BR>
      30 When thou lettest thy breath go forth, they shall be made;
      * and thou shalt renew the face of the earth.<BR>
      31 The glorious majesty of the LORD shall endure for ever; *
      the LORD shall rejoice in his works.<BR>
      32 The earth shall tremble at the look of him; * if he do but
      touch the hills, they shall smoke.<BR>
      33 I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live; * I will praise
      my God while I have my being.<BR>
      34 And so shall my words please him: * my joy shall be in the
      LORD.<BR>
      35 As for sinners, they shall be consumed out of the earth, *
      and the ungodly shall come to an end.<BR>
      36 Praise thou the LORD, O my soul. * Praise the LORD.
