      <P><B>Psalm 58. Si vere utique.</B><BR>
      ARE your minds set upon righteousness, O ye congregation? * and
      do ye judge the thing that is right, O ye sons of men?<BR>
      2 Yea, ye imagine mischief in your heart upon the earth, * and
      your hands deal with wickedness.<BR>
      3 The ungodly are froward, even from their mother's womb; * as
      soon as they are born, they go astray, and speak lies.<BR>
      4 They are as venomous as the poison of a serpent, * even like
      the deaf adder, that stoppeth her ears;<BR>
      5 Which refuseth to hear the voice of the charmer, * charm he
      never so wisely.<BR>
      6 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouths; * smite the jaw-bones
      of the lions, O LORD.<BR>
      7 Let them fall away like water that runneth apace; * when they
      shoot their arrows, let them be rooted out.<BR>
      8 Let them consume away like a snail, and be like the untimely
      fruit of a woman; * and let them not see the sun.<BR>
      9 Or ever your pots be made hot with thorns, * he shall take
      them away with a whirlwind, the green and the burning alike.<BR>
      10 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance; *
      he shall wash his footsteps in the blood of the ungodly.<BR>
      11 So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the
      righteous; * doubtless there is a God that judgeth the earth.
