      <P><B>Psalm 132. Memento, Domine.</B><BR>
      LORD, remember David, * and all his trouble:<BR>
      2 How he sware unto the LORD, * and vowed a vow unto the Almighty
      God of Jacob:<BR>
      3 I will not come within the tabernacle of mine house, * nor
      climb up into my bed;<BR>
      4 I will not suffer mine eyes to sleep, nor mine eyelids to slumber;
      * neither the temples of my head to take any rest;<BR>
      5 Until I find out a place for the temple of the LORD; * an habitation
      for the Mighty God of Jacob.<BR>
      6 Lo, we heard of the same at Ephratah, * and found it in the
      wood.<BR>
      7 We will go into his tabernacle, * and fall low on our knees
      before his footstool.<BR>
      8 Arise, O LORD, into thy resting-place; * thou, and the ark
      of thy strength.<BR>
      9 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; * and let thy
      saints sing with joyfulness.<BR>
      10 For thy servant David's sake, * turn not away the face of
      thine anointed.<BR>
      11 The LORD hath made a faithful oath unto David, * and he shall
      not shrink from it:<BR>
      12 Of the fruit of thy body * shall I set upon thy throne.<BR>
      13 If thy children will keep my covenant, and my testimonies
      that I shall teach them; * their children also shall sit upon
      thy throne for evermore.<BR>
      14 For the LORD hath chosen Sion to be an habitation for himself;
      * he hath longed for her.<BR>
      15 This shall be my rest for ever: * here will I dwell, for I
      have a delight therein.<BR>
      16 I will bless her victuals with increase, * and will satisfy
      her poor with bread.<BR>
      17 I will deck her priests with health, * and her saints shall
      rejoice and sing.<BR>
      18 There shall I make the horn of David to flourish: * I have
      ordained a lantern for mine anointed.<BR>
      19 As for his enemies, I shall clothe them with shame; * but
      upon himself shall his crown flourish.
