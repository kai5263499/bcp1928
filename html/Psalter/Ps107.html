      <P><B>Psalm 107. Confitemini Domino.</B><BR>
      O GIVE thanks unto the LORD, for he is gracious, * and his mercy
      endureth for ever.<BR>
      2 Let them give thanks whom the LORD hath redeemed, * and delivered
      from the hand of the enemy;<BR>
      3 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from
      the west; * from the north, and from the south.<BR>
      4 They went astray in the wilderness out of the way, * and found
      no city to dwell in.<BR>
      5 Hungry and thirsty, * their soul fainted in them.<BR>
      6 So they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, * and he delivered
      them from their distress.<BR>
      7 He led them forth by the right way, * that they might go to
      the city where they dwelt.<BR>
      8 O that men would therefore praise the LORD for his goodness;
      * and declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men!<BR>
      9 For he satisfieth the empty soul, * and filleth the hungry
      soul with goodness.<BR>
      10 Such as sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death, * being
      fast bound in misery and iron;<BR>
      11 Because they rebelled against the words of the Lord, * and
      lightly regarded the counsel of the Most Highest;<BR>
      12 He also brought down their heart through heaviness: * they
      fell down, and there was none to help them.<BR>
      13 SO when they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, * he delivered
      them out of their distress.<BR>
      14 For he brought them out of darkness, and out of the shadow
      of death, * and brake their bonds in sunder.<BR>
      15 O that men would therefore praise the LORD for his goodness;
      * and declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men
      !<BR>
      16 For he hath broken the gates of brass, * and smitten the bars
      of iron in sunder.<BR>
      17 Foolish men are plagued for their offence, * and because of
      their wickedness.<BR>
      18 Their soul abhorred all manner of meat, * and they were even
      hard at death's door.<BR>
      19 So when they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, * he delivered
      them out of their distress.<BR>
      20 He sent his word, and healed them; * and they were saved from
      their destruction.<BR>
      21 O that men would therefore praise the LORD for his goodness;
      * and declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men
      !<BR>
      22 That they would offer unto him the sacrifice of thanksgiving,
      * and tell out his works with gladness!<BR>
      23 They that go down to the sea in ships, * and occupy their
      business in great waters;<BR>
      24 These men see the works of the LORD, * and his wonders in
      the deep.<BR>
      25 For at his word the stormy wind ariseth, * which lifteth up
      the waves thereof.<BR>
      26 They are carried up to the heaven, and down again to the deep;
      * their soul melteth away because of the trouble.<BR>
      27 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, * and
      are at their wit's end.<BR>
      28 SO when they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, * he delivereth
      them out of their distress.<BR>
      29 For he maketh the storm to cease, * so that the waves thereof
      are still.<BR>
      30 Then are they glad, because they are at rest; * and so he
      bringeth them unto the haven where they would be.<BR>
      31 O that men would therefore praise the LORD for his goodness;
      * and declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men!<BR>
      32 That they would exalt him also in the congregation of the
      people, * and praise him in the seat of the elders!<BR>
      33 He turneth the floods into a wilderness, * and drieth up the
      water-springs.<BR>
      34 A fruitful land maketh he barren, * for the wickedness of
      them that dwell therein.<BR>
      35 Again, he maketh the wilderness a standing water, * and water-springs
      of a dry ground.<BR>
      36 And there he setteth the hungry, * that they may build them
      a city to dwell in;<BR>
      37 That they may sow their land, and plant vineyards, * to yield
      them fruits of increase.<BR>
      38 He blesseth them, so that they multiply exceedingly; * and
      suffereth not their cattle to decrease.<BR>
      39 And again, when they are minished and brought low * through
      oppression, through any plague or trouble;<BR>
      40 Though he suffer them to be evil entreated through tyrants,
      * and let them wander out of the way in the wilderness;<BR>
      41 Yet helpeth he the poor out of misery, * and maketh him households
      like a flock of sheep.<BR>
      42 The righteous will consider this, and rejoice; * and the mouth
      of all wickedness shall be stopped.<BR>
      43 Whoso is wise, will ponder these things; * and they shall
      understand the loving-kindness of the LORD.
