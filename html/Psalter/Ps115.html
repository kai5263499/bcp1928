      <P><B>Psalm 115. Non nobis, Domine.</B><BR>
      NOT unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy Name give the
      praise; * for thy loving mercy, and for thy truth's sake.<BR>
      2 Wherefore shall the heathen say, * Where is now their God?<BR>
      3 As for our God, he is in heaven: * he hath done whatsoever
      pleased him.<BR>
      4 Their idols are silver and gold, * even the work of men's hands.<BR>
      5 They have mouths, and speak not; * eyes have they, and see
      not.<BR>
      6 They have ears, and hear not; * noses have they, and smell
      not.<BR>
      7 They have hands, and handle not; feet have they, and walk not;
      * neither speak they through their throat.<BR>
      8 They that make them are like unto them; * and so are all such
      as put their trust in them.<BR>
      9 But thou, house of Israel, trust thou in the LORD; * he is
      their helper and defender.<BR>
      10 Ye house of Aaron, put your trust in the LORD; * he is their
      helper and defender.<BR>
      11 Ye that fear the LORD, put your trust in the LORD; * he is
      their helper and defender.<BR>
      12 The LORD hath been mindful of us, and he shall bless us; *
      even he shall bless the house of Israel, he shall bless the house
      of Aaron.<BR>
      13 He shall bless them that fear the LORD, * both small and great.<BR>
      14 The LORD shall increase you more and more, * you and your
      children.<BR>
      15 Ye are the blessed of the LORD, * who made heaven and earth.<BR>
      16 All the whole heavens are the LORD'S; * the earth hath he
      given to the children of men.<BR>
      17 The dead praise not thee, O LORD, * neither all they that
      go down into silence.<BR>
      18 But we will praise the LORD, * from this time forth for evermore.
      Praise the LORD.
