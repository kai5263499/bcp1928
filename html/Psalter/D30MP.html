    <p><strong>Psalm 144. Benedictus Dominus.</strong><br />
      BLESSED be the LORD my strength, * who teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight:<br />
      2 My hope and my fortress, my castle and deliverer, my defender in whom I trust; * who subdueth my people that is under me.<br />
      3 LORD, what is man, that thou hast such respect unto him? * or the son of man, that thou so regardest him?<br />
      4 Man is like a thing of nought; * his time passeth away like a shadow.<br />
      5 Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down; * touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.<br />
      6 Cast forth thy lightning, and tear them; * shoot out thine arrows, and consume them.<br />
      7 Send down thine hand from above; * deliver me, and take me out of the great waters, from the hand of strangers;<br />
      8 Whose mouth talketh of vanity, * and their right hand is a right hand of wickedness.<br />
      9 I will sing a new song unto thee, O God; * and sing praises unto thee upon a ten-stringed lute.<br />
      10 Thou hast given victory unto kings, * and hast delivered David thy servant from the peril of the sword.<br />
      11 Save me, and deliver me from the hand of strangers, * whose mouth talketh of vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of iniquity:<br />
      12 That our sons may grow up as the young plants, * and that our daughters may be as the polished corners of the temple;<br />
      13 That our garners may be full and plenteous with all manner of store; * that our sheep may bring forth thousands, and ten thousands in our fields;<br />
      14 That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no decay, * no leading into captivity, and no complaining in our streets.<br />
      15 Happy are the people that are in such a case; * yea, blessed are the people who have the LORD for their God.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 145. Exaltabo te, Deus.</strong><br />
      I WILL magnify thee, O God, my King; * and I will praise thy Name for ever and ever.<br />
      2 Every day will I give thanks unto thee; * and praise thy Name for ever and ever.<br />
      3 Great is the LORD, and marvellous worthy to be praised; * there is no end of his greatness.<br />
      4 One generation shall praise thy works unto another, * and declare thy power.<br />
      5 As for me, I will be talking of thy worship, * thy glory, thy praise, and wondrous works;<br />
      6 So that men shall speak of the might of thy marvellous acts; * and I will also tell of thy greatness.<br />
      7 The memorial of thine abundant kindness shall be showed; * and men shall sing of thy righteousness.<br />
      8 The LORD is gracious and merciful; * long-suffering, and of great goodness.<br />
      9 The LORD is loving unto every man; * and his mercy is over all his works.<br />
      10 All thy works praise thee, O LORD; * and thy saints give thanks unto thee.<br />
      11 They show the glory of thy kingdom, * and talk of thy power;<br />
      12 That thy power, thy glory, and mightiness of thy kingdom, * might be known unto men.<br />
      13 Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, * and thy dominion endureth throughout all ages.<br />
      14 The LORD upholdeth all such as fall, * and lifteth up all those that are down.<br />
      15 The eyes of all wait upon thee, O Lord; * and thou givest them their meat in due season.<br />
      16 Thou openest thine hand, * and fillest all things living with plenteousness.<br />
      17 The LORD is righteous in all his ways, * and holy in all his works.<br />
      18 The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him; * yea, all such as call upon him faithfully.<br />
      19 He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him; * he also will hear their cry, and will help them.<br />
      20 The LORD preserveth all them that love him; * but scattereth abroad all the ungodly.<br />
      21 My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD; * and let all flesh give thanks unto his holy Name for ever and ever.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 146. Lauda, anima mea.</strong><br />
      PRAISE the LORD, O my soul: while I live, will I praise the LORD; * yea, as long as I have any being, I will sing praises unto my God.<br />
      2 O put not your trust in princes, nor in any child of man; * for there is no help in them.<br />
      3 For when the breath of man goeth forth, he shall turn again to his earth, * and then all his thoughts perish.<br />
      4 Blessed is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, * and whose hope is in the LORD his God:<br />
      5 Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that therein is; * who keepeth his promise for ever;<br />
      6 Who helpeth them to right that suffer wrong; * who feedeth the hungry.<br />
      7 The LORD looseth men out of prison; * the LORD giveth sight to the blind.<br />
      8 The LORD helpeth them that are fallen; * the LORD careth for the righteous.<br />
      9 The LORD careth for the strangers; he defendeth the fatherless and widow: * as for the way of the ungodly, he turneth it upside down.<br />
    10 The LORD thy God, O Sion, shall be King for evermore, * and throughout all generations.
