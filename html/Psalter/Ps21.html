      <P><B>Psalms 21. Domine, in virtute tua.</B><BR>
      THE King shall rejoice in thy strength, O LORD; * exceeding glad
      shall he be of thy salvation.<BR>
      2 Thou hast given him his heart's desire, * and hast not denied
      him the request of his lips.<BR>
      3 For thou shalt meet him with the blessings of goodness, * and
      shalt set a crown of pure gold upon his head.<BR>
      4 He asked life of thee; and thou gavest him a long life, * even
      for ever and ever.<BR>
      5 His honour is great in thy salvation; * glory and great worship
      shalt thou lay upon him.<BR>
      6 For thou shalt give him everlasting felicity, * and make him
      glad with the joy of thy countenance.<BR>
      7 And why? because the King putteth his trust in the LORD; *
      and in the mercy of the Most Highest he shall not miscarry.<BR>
      8 All thine enemies shall feel thine hand; * thy right hand shall
      find out them that hate thee.<BR>
      9 Thou shalt make them like a fiery oven in time of thy wrath:
      * the LORD shall destroy them in his displeasure, and the fire
      shall consume them.<BR>
      10 Their fruit shalt thou root out of the earth, * and their
      seed from among the children of men.<BR>
      11 For they intended mischief against thee, * and imagined such
      a device as they are not able to perform.<BR>
      12 Therefore shalt thou put them to flight, * and the strings
      of thy bow shalt thou make ready against the face of them.<BR>
      13 Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength; * so will we
      sing, and praise thy power.
