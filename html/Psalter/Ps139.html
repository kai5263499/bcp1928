      <P><B>Psalm 139. Domine, probasti.</B><BR>
      O LORD, thou hast searched me out, and known me. * Thou knowest
      my down-sitting, and mine uprising; thou understandest my thoughts
      long before.<BR>
      2 Thou art about my path, and about my bed; * and art acquainted
      with all my ways.<BR>
      3 For lo, there is not a word in my tongue, * but thou, O LORD,
      knowest it altogether.<BR>
      4 Thou hast beset me behind and before, * and laid thine hand
      upon me.<BR>
      5 Such knowledge is too wonderful and excellent for me; * I cannot
      attain unto it.<BR>
      6 Whither shall I go then from thy Spirit? * or whither shall
      I go then from thy presence?<BR>
      7 If I climb up into heaven, thou art there; * if I go down to
      hell, thou art there also.<BR>
      8 If I take the wings of the morning, * and remain in the uttermost
      parts of the sea;<BR>
      9 Even there also shall thy hand lead me, * and thy right hand
      shall hold me.<BR>
      10 If I say, Peradventure the darkness shall cover me; * then
      shall my night be turned to day.<BR>
      11 Yea, the darkness is no darkness with thee, but the night
      is as clear as the day; * the darkness and light to thee are
      both alike.<BR>
      12 For my reins are thine; * thou hast covered me in my mother's
      womb.<BR>
      13 I will give thanks unto thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully
      made: * marvellous are thy works, and that my soul knoweth right
      well.<BR>
      14 My bones are not hid from thee, * though I be made secretly,
      and fashioned beneath in the earth.<BR>
      15 Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being imperfect; * and
      in thy book were all my members written;<BR>
      16 Which day by day were fashioned, * when as yet there was none
      of them.<BR>
      17 How dear are thy counsels unto me, O God; * O how great is
      the sum of them!<BR>
      18 If I tell them, they are more in number than the sand: * when
      I wake up, I am present with thee.<BR>
      19 Wilt thou not slay the wicked, O God? * Depart from me, ye
      blood-thirsty men.<BR>
      20 For they speak unrighteously against thee; * and thine enemies
      take thy Name in vain.<BR>
      21 Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? * and am not I
      grieved with those that rise up against thee?<BR>
      22 Yea, I hate them right sore; * even as though they were mine
      enemies.<BR>
      23 Try me, O God, and seek the ground of my heart; * prove me,
      and examine my thoughts.<BR>
      24 Look well if there be any way of wickedness in me; * and lead
      me in the way everlasting.
