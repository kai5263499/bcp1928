    <p><strong>Psalm 6. Domine, ne in furore.</strong><br />
      O LORD, rebuke me not in thine indignation, * neither chasten me in thy displeasure.<br />
      2 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am weak; * O LORD, heal me, for my bones are vexed.<br />
      3 My soul also is sore troubled: * but, LORD, how long wilt thou punish me?<br />
      4 Turn thee, O LORD, and deliver my soul; * O save me, for thy mercy's sake.<br />
      5 For in death no man remembereth thee; * and who will give thee thanks in the pit?<br />
      6 I am weary of my groaning; * every night wash I my bed, and water my couch with my tears.<br />
      7 My beauty is gone for very trouble, * and worn away because of all mine enemies.<br />
      8 Away from me, all ye that work iniquity; * for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping.<br />
      9 The LORD hath heard my petition; * the LORD will receive my prayer.<br />
      10 All mine enemies shall be confounded, and sore vexed; * they shall be turned back, and put to shame suddenly.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 7. Domine, Deus meus.</strong><br />
      O LORD my God, in thee have I put my trust: * save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me;<br />
      2 Lest he devour my soul like a lion, and tear it in pieces, * while there is none to help.<br />
      3 O LORD my God, if I have done any such thing; * or if there be any wickedness in my hands;<br />
      4 If I have rewarded evil unto him that dealt friendly with me; * (yea, I have delivered him that without any cause is mine enemy;)<br />
      5 Then let mine enemy persecute my soul, and take me; * yea, let him tread my life down upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust.<br />
      6 Stand up, O LORD, in thy wrath, and lift up thyself, because of the indignation of mine enemies; * arise up for me in the judgment that thou hast commanded.<br />
      7 And so shall the congregation of the peoples come about thee: * for their sakes therefore lift up thyself again.<br />
      8 The LORD shall judge the peoples: give sentence with me, O LORD, * according to my righteousness, and according to the innocency that is in me.<br />
      9 O let the wickedness of the ungodly come to an end; * but guide thou the just.<br />
      10 For the righteous God * trieth the very hearts and reins.<br />
      11 My help cometh of God, * who preserveth them that are true of heart.<br />
      12 God is a righteous Judge, strong, and patient; * and God is provoked every day.<br />
      13 If a man will not turn, he will whet his sword; * he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.<br />
      14 He hath prepared for him the instruments of death; * he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.<br />
      15 Behold, the ungodly travaileth with iniquity; * he hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.<br />
      16 He hath graven and digged up a pit, * and is fallen himself into the destruction that he made for other.<br />
      17 For his travail shall come upon his own head, * and his wickedness shall fall on his own pate.<br />
      18 I will give thanks unto the LORD, according to his righteousness; * and I will praise the Name of the LORD Most High.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 8. Domine, Dominus noster.</strong><br />
      O LORD our Governor, how excellent is thy Name in all the world; * thou that hast set thy glory above the heavens!<br />
      2 Out of the mouth of very babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength, because of thine enemies, * that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.<br />
      3 When I consider thy heavens, even the work of thy fingers; * the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained;<br />
      4 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? * and the son of man, that thou visitest him?<br />
      5 Thou madest him lower than the angels, * to crown him with glory and worship.<br />
      6 Thou makest him to have dominion of the works of thy hands; * and thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet:<br />
      7 All sheep and oxen; * yea, and the beasts of the field;<br />
      8 The fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea; * and whatsoever walketh through the paths of the seas.<br />
    9 O LORD our Governor, * how excellent is thy Name in all the world!
