      The Sixth Day.<BR>
<BR>
      Morning Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 30. Exaltabo te, Domine.</B><BR>
      I WILL magnify thee, O LORD; for thou hast set me up, * and not
      made my foes to triumph over me.<BR>
      2 O LORD my God, I cried unto thee; * and thou hast healed me.<BR>
      3 Thou, LORD, hast brought my soul out of hell: * thou hast kept
      my life, that I should not go down into the pit.<BR>
      4 Sing praises unto the LORD, O ye saints of his; * and give
      thanks unto him, for a remembrance of his holiness.<BR>
      5 For his wrath endureth but the twinkling of an eye, and in
      his pleasure is life; * heaviness may endure for a night, but
      joy cometh in the morning.<BR>
      6 And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be removed: * thou,
      LORD, of thy goodness, hast made my hill so strong.<BR>
      7 Thou didst turn thy face from me, * and I was troubled.<BR>
      8 Then cried I unto thee, O LORD; * and gat me to my LORD right
      humbly.<BR>
      9 What profit is there in my blood, * when I go down into the
      pit?<BR>
      10 Shall the dust give thanks unto thee? * or shall it declare
      thy truth?<BR>
      11 Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me; * LORD, be thou my helper.<BR>
      12 Thou hast turned my heaviness into joy; * thou hast put off
      my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness:<BR>
      13 Therefore shall every good man sing of thy praise without
      ceasing. * O my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 31. In te, Domine, speravi.</B><BR>
      IN thee, O LORD, have I put my trust; let me never be put to
      confusion; * deliver me in thy righteousness.<BR>
      2 Bow down thine ear to me; * make haste to deliver me.<BR>
      3 And be thou my strong rock, and house of defence, * that thou
      mayest save me.<BR>
      4 For thou art my strong rock, and my castle: * be thou also
      my guide, and lead me for thy Name's sake.<BR>
      5 Draw me out of the net that they have laid privily for me;
      * for thou art my strength.<BR>
      6 Into thy hands I commend my spirit; * for thou hast redeemed
      me, O LORD, thou God of truth.<BR>
      7 I have hated them that hold of lying vanities, * and my trust
      hath been in the LORD.<BR>
      8 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy; * for thou hast considered
      my trouble, and hast known my soul in adversities.<BR>
      9 Thou hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy; * but
      hast set my feet in a large room.<BR>
      10 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble, * and mine
      eye is consumed for very heaviness; yea, my soul and my body.<BR>
      11 For my life is waxen old with heaviness, * and my years with
      mourning.<BR>
      12 My strength faileth me, because of mine iniquity, * and my
      bones are consumed.<BR>
      13 I became a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially
      among my neighbours; * and they of mine acquaintance were afraid
      of me; and they that did see me without, conveyed themselves
      from me.<BR>
      14 I am clean forgotten as a dead man out of mind; * I am become
      like a broken vessel.<BR>
      15 For I have heard the blasphemy of the multitude, and fear
      is on every side; * while they conspire together against me,
      and take their counsel to take away my life.<BR>
      16 But my hope hath been in thee, O LORD; * I have said, Thou
      art my God.<BR>
      17 My times are in thy hand; deliver me from the hand of mine
      enemies, * and from them that persecute me.<BR>
      18 Show thy servant the light of thy countenance, * and save
      me for thy mercy's sake.<BR>
      19 Let me not be confounded, O LORD, for I have called upon thee;
      * let the ungodly be put to confusion, and be put to silence
      in the grave.<BR>
      20 Let the lying lips be put to silence, * which cruelly, disdainfully,
      and despitefully speak against the righteous.<BR>
      21 O how plentiful is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for
      them that fear thee, * and that thou hast prepared for them that
      put their trust in thee, even before the sons of men!<BR>
      22 Thou shalt hide them in the covert of thine own presence from
      the plottings of men: * thou shalt keep them secretly in thy
      tabernacle from the strife of tongues.<BR>
      23 Thanks be to the LORD; * for he hath showed me marvellous
      great kindness in a strong city.<BR>
      24 But in my haste I said, * I am cast out of the sight of thine
      eyes.<BR>
      25 Nevertheless, thou heardest the voice of my prayer, * when
      I cried unto thee.<BR>
      26 O love the LORD, all ye his saints; * for the LORD preserveth
      them that are faithful, and plenteously rewardeth the proud doer.<BR>
      27 Be strong, and he shall establish your heart, * all ye that
      put your trust in the LORD.<BR>

      <P><CENTER><A NAME="anchor489896"></A>Evening Prayer.</CENTER></P>

      <P><B>Psalm 32. Beati quorum.</B><BR>
      BLESSED is he whose unrighteousness is forgiven, * and whose
      sin is covered.<BR>
      2 Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth no sin, * and
      in whose spirit there is no guile.<BR>
      3 For whilst I held my tongue, * my bones consumed away through
      my daily complaining.<BR>
      4 For thy hand was heavy upon me day and night, * and my moisture
      was like the drought in summer.<BR>
      5 I acknowledged my sin unto thee; * and mine unrighteousness
      have I not hid.<BR>
      6 I said, I will confess my sins unto the LORD; * and SO thou
      forgavest the wickedness of my sin.<BR>
      7 For this shall every one that is godly make his prayer unto
      thee, in a time when thou mayest be found; * surely the great
      water-floods shall not come nigh him.<BR>
      8 Thou art a place to hide me in; thou shalt preserve me from
      trouble; * thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance.<BR>
      9 I will inform thee, and teach thee in the way wherein thou
      shalt go; * and I will guide thee with mine eye.<BR>
      10 Be ye not like to horse and mule, which have no understanding;
      * whose mouths must be held with bit and bridle, else they will
      not obey thee.<BR>
      11 Great plagues remain for the ungodly; * but whoso putteth
      his trust in the LORD, mercy embraceth him on every side.<BR>
      12 Be glad, O ye righteous, and rejoice in the LORD; * and be
      joyful, all ye that are true of heart.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 33. Exultate, justi.</B><BR>
      REJOICE in the LORD, O ye righteous; * for it becometh well the
      just to be thankful.<BR>
      2 Praise the LORD with harp; * sing praises unto him with the
      lute, and instrument of ten strings.<BR>
      3 Sing unto the Lord a new song; * sing praises lustily unto
      him with a good courage.<BR>
      4 For the word of the LORD is true; * and all his works are faithful.<BR>
      5 He loveth righteousness and judgment; * the earth is full of
      the goodness of the LORD.<BR>
      6 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; * and all the
      host of them by the breath of his mouth.<BR>
      7 He gathereth the waters of the sea together, as it were upon
      an heap; * and layeth up the deep, as in a treasure-house.<BR>
      8 Let all the earth fear the LORD: * stand in awe of him, all
      ye that dwell in the world.<BR>
      9 For he spake, and it was done; * he commanded, and it stood
      fast.<BR>
      10 The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought, *
      and maketh the devices of the people to be of none effect, and
      casteth out the counsels of princes.<BR>
      11 The counsel of the LORD shall endure for ever, * and the thoughts
      of his heart from generation to generation.<BR>
      12 Blessed are the people whose God is the Lord JEHOVAH; * and
      blessed are the folk that he hath chosen to him, to be his inheritance.<BR>
      13 The LORD looketh down from heaven, and beholdeth all the children
      of men; * from the habitation of his dwelling, he considereth
      all them that dwell on the earth.<BR>
      14 He fashioneth all the hearts of them, * and understandeth
      all their works.<BR>
      15 There is no king that can be saved by the multitude of an
      host; * neither is any mighty man delivered by much strength.<BR>
      16 A horse is counted but a vain thing to save a man; * neither
      shall he deliver any man by his great strength.<BR>
      17 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, *
      and upon them that put their trust in his mercy;<BR>
      18 To deliver their soul from death, * and to feed them in the
      time of dearth.<BR>
      19 Our soul hath patiently tarried for the LORD; * for he is
      our help and our shield.<BR>
      20 For our heart shall rejoice in him; * because we have hoped
      in his holy Name.<BR>
      21 Let thy merciful kindness, O LORD, be upon us, * like as we
      do put our trust in thee.<BR>
<BR>
      <B><BR>
      Psalm 34. Benedicam Dominum.</B><BR>
      I WILL alway give thanks unto the LORD; * his praise shall ever
      be in my mouth.<BR>
      2 My soul shall make her boast in the LORD; * the humble shall
      hear thereof, and be glad.<BR>
      3 O praise the LORD with me, * and let us magnify his Name together.<BR>
      4 I sought the LORD, and he heard me; * yea, he delivered me
      out of all my fear.<BR>
      5 They had an eye unto him, and were lightened; * and their faces
      were not ashamed.<BR>
      6 Lo, the poor crieth, and the LORD heareth him; * yea, and saveth
      him out of all his troubles.<BR>
      7 The angel of the LORD tarrieth round about them that fear him,
      * and delivereth them.<BR>
      8 O taste, and see, how gracious the LORD is: * blessed is the
      man that trusteth in him.<BR>
      9 O fear the LORD, ye that are his saints; * for they that fear
      him lack nothing.<BR>
      10 The lions do lack, and suffer hunger; * but they who seek
      the LORD shall want no manner of thing that is good.<BR>
      11 Come, ye children, and hearken unto me; * I will teach you
      the fear of the LORD.<BR>
      12 What man is he that lusteth to live, * and would fain see
      good days?<BR>
      13 Keep thy tongue from evil, * and thy lips, that they speak
      no guile.<BR>
      14 Eschew evil, and do good; * seek peace, and ensue it.<BR>
      15 The eyes of the LORD are over the righteous, * and his ears
      are open unto their prayers.<BR>
      16 The countenance of the LORD is against them that do evil,
      * to root out the remembrance of them from the earth.<BR>
      17 The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth them, * and delivereth
      them out of all their troubles.<BR>
      18 The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart, *
      and will save such as be of an humble spirit.<BR>
      19 Great are the troubles of the righteous; * but the LORD delivereth
      him out of all.<BR>
      20 He keepeth all his bones, * so that not one of them is broken.<BR>
      21 But misfortune shall slay the ungodly; * and they that hate
      the righteous shall be desolate.<BR>
      22 The LORD delivereth the souls of his servants; * and all they
      that put their trust in him shall not be destitute.</P>
