Communion, or at Morning Prayer or Evening Prayer, or separately.<BR><BR>&para; The Bishop is to be received at the entrance of the Church, or Chapel,
by the Church-wardens and Vestrymen, or some other persons appointed for
that purpose. The Bishop and the Clergy who are present shall go up the
aisle of the Church, or Chapel, to the Holy Table, repeating the following
Psalm alternately, the Bishop one verse and the Clergy another.</I></H6><P><BR><BR><B>Domini est terra. Psalm xxiv.</B><BR>THE earth is the LORD'S, and all that therein is; * the compass of the world,
and they that dwell therein.<BR>2 For he hath founded it upon the seas, * and stablished it upon the floods.<BR>3 Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? * or who shall rise up in
his holy place?<BR>4 Even he that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; * and that hath not lift
up his mind unto vanity, nor sworn to deceive his neighbour.<BR>5 He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, * and righteousness from
the God of his salvation.<BR>6 This is the generation of them that seek him; * even of them that seek
thy face, O Jacob.<BR>7 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors;
* and the King of glory shall come in.<BR>8 Who is this King of glory? * It is the LORD strong and mighty, even the
LORD mighty in battle.<BR>9 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors;
* and the King of glory shall come in.<BR>10 Who is this King of glory? * Even the LORD of hosts, he is the King of
glory.<BR>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost;<BR>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, * world without end.
Amen.</P><H6><I><BR>&para; The Bishop shall go within the rails, with such of the Clergy as
can be there accommodated. The Bishop, sitting in his chair, shall have
the instruments of Donation and Endowment, if there be any, presented to
him; and then standing up, and turning to the Congregation, he shall say,</I></H6><P><BR>DEARLY beloved in the Lord; forasmuch as devout and holy men, as well under
the Law as under the Gospel, moved either by the express command of God,
or by the secret inspiration of the blessed Spirit, and acting agreeably
to their own reason and sense of the natural decency of things, have erected
houses for the public worship of God, and separated them from all unhallowed,
worldly, and common uses, in order to fill men's minds with greater reverence
for his glorious Majesty, and affect their hearts with more devotion and
humility in his service; which pious works have been approved of and graciously
accepted by our heavenly Father; Let us not doubt but that he will also
favourably approve our godly purpose of setting apart this place in solemn
manner, for the several Offices of religious worship, and let us faithfully
and devoutly beg his blessing on this our undertaking.</P><H6 ALIGN=CENTER><I>&para; Then the Bishop, kneeling, shall say the following
Prayer.</I></H6><P><BR>O ETERNAL God, mighty in power, and of majesty incomprehensible, whom the
heaven of heavens cannot contain, much less the walls of temples made with
hands; and who yet hast been graciously pleased to promise thy especial
presence, wherever two or three of thy faithful servants shall assemble
in thy Name, to offer up their praises and supplications unto thee; Vouchsafe,
O Lord, to be present with us, who are here gathered together with all humility
and readiness of heart, to consecrate this place to the honour of thy great
Name; separating it henceforth from all unhallowed, ordinary, and common
uses; and dedicating it to thy service, for reading thy holy Word, for celebrating
thy holy Sacraments, for offering to thy glorious Majesty the sacrifices
of prayer and thanksgiving, for blessing thy people in thy Name, and for
all other holy offices: accept, O Lord, this service at our hands, and bless
it with such success as may tend most to thy glory, and the furtherance
of our happiness both tem- poral and spiritual; through Jesus Christ our
blessed Lord and Saviour. <B>Amen.</B></P><H6><I><BR>&para; After this the Bishop shall stand up, and turning his face towards
the Congregation, shall say,</I></H6><P><BR>REGARD, O Lord, the supplications of thy servants, and grant that whosoever
in this house shall be received by Baptism into the congregation of Christ's
flock, may be sanctified by the Holy Ghost, and may continue Christ's faithful
soldier and servant unto his life's end. <B>Amen.</B><BR><BR>GRANT, O Lord, that they who at this place shall in their own persons renew
the promises and vows of their Baptism, and be Confirmed by the Bishop,
may receive such a measure of thy Holy Spirit, that they may grow in grace
unto their life's end. <B>Amen.</B><BR><BR>GRANT, O Lord, that whosoever shall receive in this place the blessed Sacrament
of the Body and Blood of Christ, may come to that holy ordinance with faith,
charity, and true repentance; and being filled with thy grace and heavenly
benediction, may, to their great and endless comfort, obtain remission of
their sins, and all other benefits of his passion. <B>Amen.</B><BR><BR>GRANT, O Lord, that by thy holy Word which shall be read and preached in
this place, and by thy Holy Spirit grafting it inwardly in the heart, the
hearers thereof may both perceive and know what things they ought to do,
and may have power and strength to fulfil the same. <B>Amen.</B><BR><BR>GRANT, O Lord, that whosoever shall be joined to- gether in this place in
the holy estate of Matrimony, may faithfully perform and keep the vow and
covenant betwixt them made, and may remain in perfect love together unto
their life's end. <B>Amen.</B><BR><BR>GRANT, we beseech thee, blessed Lord, that whosoever shall draw near to
thee in this place, to give thee thanks for the benefits which they have
received at thy hands, to set forth thy most worthy praise, to confess their
sins unto thee, and to ask such things as are requisite and necessary, as
well for the body as for the soul, may do it with such steadiness of faith,
and with such seriousness, affection, and devotion of mind, that thou mayest
accept their bounden duty and service, and vouchsafe to give whatever in
thy infinite wisdom thou shalt see to be most expedient for them. All which
we beg for Jesus Christ's sake, our most blessed Lord and Saviour. <B>Amen.</B></P><H6><I>&para; Then, the Bishop sitting in his chair, the Sentence of Consecration
is to be read by some person appointed by him, and then laid by him upon
the Communion Table; after which, the Bishop shall say,</I></H6><P><BR>BLESSED be thy Name, O Lord, that it hath pleased thee to put it into the
hearts of thy servants to appropriate and devote this house to thy honour
and worship; and grant that all who shall enjoy the benefit of this pious
work, may show forth their thankfulness, by making a right use of it, to
the glory of thy blessed Name; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</P><H6><I>&para; When there is a Communion, the following shall be the Collect,
Epistle, and Gospel.</I></H6><P ALIGN=CENTER><B>The Collect.</B><P>MOST glorious God, whom the heaven of heavens cannot contain; Graciously
accept the Dedication of this place to thy service; and grant that all who
shall call upon thee here may worship thee in spirit and in truth, and may
in their lives show forth thy praise; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<BR><P ALIGN=CENTER><B>For the Epistle.</B> <I>Revelation xxi. 2.</I><P>AND I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out
of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great
voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and
he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall
be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their
eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither
shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. And
he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he
said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.<BR><P ALIGN=CENTER><B>The Gospel.<I> </I></B><I>St. John ii. 13.</I><P>AND the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem, and
found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers
of money sitting: and when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove
them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out
the changers' money, and overthrew the tables; and said unto them that sold
doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.
And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house
hath eaten me up.</P><H6 ALIGN=CENTER><I>&para; And immediately before the final Blessing, the
Bishop shall say this Prayer.</I></H6><P><BR>BLESSED be thy Name, O Lord God, for that it hath pleased thee to have thy
habitation among the sons of men, and to dwell in the midst of the assembly
of the saints upon the earth; Grant, we beseech thee, that in this place
now set apart to thy service, thy holy Name may be worshipped in truth and
purity through all generations; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<BR><BR>THE Peace of God, which passeth all understanding, keep your hearts and
minds in the knowledge and love of God, and of his Son Jesus Christ our
Lord: And the Blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost, be amongst you, and remain with you always. Amen.</P><H6 ALIGN=CENTER>Go to <A HREF="index.html">1928 Book of Common Prayer</A></H6>
