in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth
and believeth in me, shall never die.<BR>JESUS called them unto him and said, Suffer the little children
to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom
of God.<BR>HE shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs
with his arms, and carry them in his bosom.</P><H6><I>&para; When they are come into the Church, shall be said

the waters of comfort.<BR>He shall convert my soul, * and bring me forth in the paths of
righteousness for his Name's sake.<BR>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil; * for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff
comfort me.<BR>Thou shalt prepare a table before me in the presence of them that
trouble me; * thou hast anointed my head with oil, and my cup
shall be full.<BR>Surely thy loving-kindness and mercy shall follow me all the days
of my life; * and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.<BR><P><CENTER><I>Levavi oculos.</I> Psalm cxxi.</CENTER><P>I WILL lift up mine eyes unto the hills; * from whence cometh
my help?<BR>My help cometh even from the LORD, * who hath made heaven and
earth.<BR>He will not suffer thy foot to be moved; * and he that keepeth
thee will not sleep.<BR>Behold, he that keepeth Israel * shall neither slumber nor sleep.<BR>The LORD himself is thy keeper; * the LORD is thy defence upon
thy right hand;<BR>So that the sun shall not burn thee by day, * neither the moon
by night.<BR>The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil; * yea, it is even
he that shall keep thy soul.<BR>The LORD shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming in, * from
this time forth for evermore.</P><H6><I>&para; Then shall follow the Lesson taken out of the eighteenth
Chapter of the Gospel according to St. Matthew.</I></H6><P><BR>AT the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is
the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? And Jesus called a little
child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, and said, Verily
I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children,
ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever therefore
shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest
in the kingdom of heaven. And whoso shall receive one such little
child in my name receiveth me. Take heed that ye despise not one
of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their
angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.</P><H6><I>&para; Here may be sung a Hymn or an Anthem; then shall
the Minister say,</I></H6><P><CENTER>The Lord be with you.<BR><B>Answer.</B> And with thy spirit.<BR><BR>Let us pray.<BR>Lord, have mercy upon us.<BR><I>Christ, have mercy upon us. </I><BR>Lord, have mercy upon us.</CENTER></P><H6><CENTER><I>&para; Then shall be said by the Minister and People,</I></CENTER></H6><P><BR>OUR Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom
come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this
day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive
those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation,
But deliver us from evil.

always behold in heaven; Grant us stedfastly to believe that this
thy child hath been taken into the safe keeping of thine eternal
love; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <I>Amen.</I><BR><BR>ALMIGHTY and merciful Father, who dost grant to children an abundant
entrance into thy kingdom; Grant us grace so to conform our lives
to their innocency and perfect faith, that at length, united with
them, we may stand in thy presence in fulness of joy; through
Jesus Christ our Lord. <I>Amen.</I><BR><BR>THE grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the

him</I> peace, both now and evermore.</P><H6><CENTER><I>&para; Then shall be said or sung,</I></CENTER></H6><P><BR>THEREFORE are they before the throne of God, and serve him day
and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall
dwell among them.<BR><BR>They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall
the sun light on them, nor any heat.<BR><BR>For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them,
and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall
wipe away all tears from their eyes.</P><H6><CENTER><I>&para; Then shall the Minister say,</I></CENTER></H6><P><CENTER><BR>The Lord be with you.<BR><B>Answer. </B>And with thy spirit.<BR>Let us pray.</CENTER><P>O GOD, whose most dear Son did take little children into his
arms and bless them; Give us grace, we beseech thee, to entrust
the soul of this child to thy neverfailing care and love, and
bring us all to thy heavenly kingdom; through the same thy Son,
Jesus Christ our Lord.<I> Amen.</I><BR><BR>ALMIGHTY God, Father of mercies and giver of all comfort; Deal
