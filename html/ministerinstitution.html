Diligence, sound Doctrine, and Prudence, we do fully confide,
our Licence and Authority to perform the Office of a Priest, in

shall at any time receive from us.<BR><BR>And as a canonically instituted Priest into the Office of Rector
of Parish, (or Church,) you are faithfully to feed that portion
of the flock of Christ which is now intrusted to you; not as a
man-pleaser, but as continually bearing in mind that you are accountable
to us here, and to the Chief Bishop and Sovereign Judge of all,
hereafter. And as the Lord hath ordained that they who serve at
the altar should live of the things belonging to the altar; so
we authorize you to claim and enjoy all the accustomed temporalities
appertaining to your cure, until some urgent reason or reasons
occasion a wish in you, or in the congregation committed to your
charge, to bring about a separation, and dissolution of all sacerdotal
relation, between you and them; of all which you will give us
due notice; and in case of any difference between you and your

of instituting the Rev. A. B. into this Parish, (or Church,) as
Priest and Rector of the same; and we are possessed of your Vote
that he has been so elected; as also of the prescribed Letter

favour, and further us with thy continual help; that in all our
works begun, continued, and ended in thee, we may glorify thy
holy Name, and finally, by thy mercy, obtain everlasting life;
through Jesus Christ our Lord, who hath taught us to Fay unto
thee, O Almighty Father, in his prevailing Name and words,<BR><BR>OUR Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom
come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this
day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive

But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power,
and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.</P><H6><I>&para; Then shall the Institutor receive the Incumbent

Amen.<BR>Let us pray.</CENTER><P>MOST gracious Father, the giver of all good and perfect gifts,
who of thy wise providence hast appointed divers Orders in thy
Church; Give thy grace, we beseech thee, to thy servant, to whom
the charge of this Congregation is now committed; and so replenish
him with the truth of thy doctrine, and endue him with innocency
of life, that he may faithfully serve before thee, to the glory
of thy great Name, and the benefit of thy holy Church; through
Jesus Christ, our only Mediator and Redeemer. <B>Amen.</B><BR><BR>O HOLY Jesus, who hast purchased to thyself an universal Church,
and hast promised to be with the Ministers of Apostolic Succession
to the end of the world; Be graciously pleased to bless the ministry
and service of him who is now appointed to offer the sacrifices
of prayer and praise to thee in this house, which is called by
thy Name. May the words of his mouth, and the meditation of his
heart, be alway acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, our strength
and our Redeemer. <B>Amen.</B><BR><BR>O GOD, Holy Ghost, Sanctifier of the faithful, visit, we pray
thee, this Congregation with thy love and favour; enlighten their
minds more and more with the light of the everlasting Gospel;
graft in their hearts a love of the truth; increase in them true
religion; nourish them with all goodness; and of thy great mercy
keep them in the same, O blessed Spirit, whom, with the Father
and the Son together, we worship and glorify as one God, world
without end. <B>Amen.<BR></B><P><CENTER><B>Benediction.</B></CENTER><P>THE God of peace, who brought again from the dead our Lord
Jesus Christ, the great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood
of the everlasting covenant; Make you perfect in every good work
to do his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in
his sight; through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and
ever. Amen.</P><H6><I>&para; Then shall the Instituted Minister kneel at the
Altar, to present his supplication for himself, in this form.</I></H6><P><BR>O LORD my God, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under
my roof; yet thou hast honoured thy servant with appointing him
to stand in thy House, and to serve at thy holy Altar. To thee
and to thy service I devote myself, body, soul, and spirit, with
all their powers and faculties. Fill my memory with the words
of thy Law; enlighten my understanding with the illumination of
the Holy Ghost; and may all the wishes and desires of my will
centre in what thou hast commanded. And, to make me instrumental
in promoting the salvation of the people now committed to my charge,
grant that I may faithfully administer thy holy Sacraments, and
by my life and doctrine set forth thy true and lively Word. Be
ever with me in the performance of all the duties of my ministry:
in prayer, to quicken my devotion; in praises, to heighten my
love and gratitude; and in preaching, to give a readiness of thought
and expression suitable to the clearness and excellency of thy
holy Word. Grant this for the sake of Jesus Christ thy Son our
Saviour.<BR></P><H6><CENTER><I>&para; The Instituted Minister, standing up, shall
say,</I></CENTER></H6><P><CENTER><BR>The Lord be with you.<BR><B>Answer. </B>And with thy spirit.<BR>Let us pray.</CENTER><P>ALMIGHTY God, who hast built thy Church upon the foundation
of the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief
corner-stone; Grant that, by the operation of the Holy Ghost,
all Christians may be so joined together in unity of spirit, and
in the bond of peace, that they may be an holy temple acceptable
unto thee. And especially to this Congregation present, give the
abundance of thy grace; that with one heart they may desire the
prosperity of thy holy Apostolic Church, and with one mouth may
profess the faith once delivered to the Saints. Defend them from
the sins of heresy and schism; let not the foot of pride come
nigh to hurt them, nor the hand of the ungodly to cast them down.
And grant that the course of this world may be so peaceably ordered
by thy governance, that thy Church may joyfully serve thee in
all godly quietness; that so they may walk in the ways of truth
and peace, and at last be numbered with thy Saints in glory everlasting;
through the merits of the same thy blessed Son Jesus Christ, the
gracious Bishop and Shepherd of our souls, who liveth and reigneth
with thee and the same Holy Ghost, one God, world without end.
Amen.</P><H6><I>&para; Then shall follow the Sermon. And after that, if
there be a Communion, the Instituted Minister shall proceed to
that Service, and to administer the holy Eucharist to his Congregation;
and after the Benediction, (which he shall always pronounce,)
the Wardens, Vestry, and others, shall salute and welcome him,
bidding him God-speed.<BR><BR>&para; When the Bishop of the Diocese * present at the Institution
of a Minister, he shall make to him the address, as prescribed
in the Office in the form of a letter.</I></H6><H6><CENTER>Go to <A HREF="index.html">1928 Book of Common Prayer</A></CENTER></H6>
