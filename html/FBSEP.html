      <p align="left" class="style10"><span class="style11">&para; This version of Evening Prayer - commonly called<strong> The Sedona Rite</strong> - is in accordance with the rubrics of the 1928 Book of Common Prayer. Various prayers have been consolidated into this  Rite and all are found in the BCP. The &quot;Prayer for All Conditions of Mankind&quot; is a compilation of the Office's prayers, with  additions coming from the &quot;Family Prayer&quot; and &quot;Prayers&quot; sections of the BCP. The parts that are bracketed and italicised indicate how the office can be shortened, as necessary. We suggest the shortened version for those who are new to the recitation of the office, and recommend the lengthening of the prayers as you are able to do so.</span></p>

    <p align="center" class="style6">CONFESSION</p>
    <p align="left">ALMIGHTY and most merciful Father; We have erred, and strayed from thy ways like lost sheep. We have followed too much the devices and desires of our own hearts. We have offended against thy holy laws. We have left undone those things which we ought to have done; And we have done those things which we ought not to have done; And there is no health in us. But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us, miserable offenders. Spare thou those, O God, who confess their faults. Restore thou those who are penitent; According to thy promises declared unto mankind In Christ Jesus our Lord. And grant, O most merciful Father, for his sake; That we may hereafter live a godly, righteous, and sober life, To the glory of thy holy Name. Amen.</p>
    <p align="center"><strong>LORD’S PRAYER</strong></p>
    <p>Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.<br />
        <br />
      O Lord, open thou our lips.<strong><br />
        And our mouth shall show forth thy praise.</strong><br />
      Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;<strong><br />
        As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</strong><br />
      Praise ye the Lord.<br />
  <strong>The Lord's Name be praised.</strong></p>

      He hath filled the hungry with good things; * and the rich he hath sent empty away.<br />

    <p align="center"><b>A Collect for Peace.</b></p>
    <p>O God, from whom all holy desires, all good counsels, and all
      just works do proceed; Give unto thy servants that peace which
      the world cannot give; that our hearts may be set to obey thy
      commandments, and also that by thee, we, being defended from
      the fear of our enemies, may pass our time in rest and quietness;
    through the merits of Jesus Christ our Saviour. Amen.</p>

      <b>A Collect for Aid against Perils.</b></p>
    <p>Lighten our darkness, we beseech thee, O Lord; and by thy great
      mercy defend us from all perils and dangers of this night; for
      the love of thy only Son, our Saviour, Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
    <p align="center"><strong>A Prayer for all Conditions of Mankind</strong>.<br />
    </p>
    <p>O GOD, the Creator and Preserver of all mankind, we humbly beseech thee for all sorts and conditions of men; that thou wouldest be pleased to make thy ways known unto them, thy saving health unto all nations.   Grant to all in authority wisdom and strength to know and to do thy will. Fill them with the love of truth and righteousness; and make them ever mindful of their calling to serve the people in thy fear.</p>
    <p>MORE especially we pray for thy holy Church universal. Send down upon our Bishops, and other Clergy, and upon the Congregations committed to their charge, the healthful Spirit of thy grace; and, that they may truly please thee, pour upon them the continual dew of thy blessing [, <em>that thy Church may be so guided and governed by thy good Spirit, that all who profess and call themselves Christians may be led into the way of truth, and hold the faith in unity of spirit, in the bond of peace, and in righteousness of life</em>]. </p>
    <p>AND we commend to thy fatherly goodness all those who are any ways afflicted, or distressed, in mind, body, or estate. [<em>Remember in pity such as are this day destitute, homeless, or forgotten of their fellow-men. Bless the congregation of thy poor. Uplift those who are cast down. Mightily befriend innocent sufferers, and sanctify to them the endurance of their wrongs. Cheer with hope all discouraged and unhappy people, and by thy heavenly grace preserve from falling those whose poverty tempteth them to sin; though they be troubled on every side, suffer them not to be distressed; though they be perplexed, save them from despair.  Pardon those who have done or wish us evil, and give them repentance and better minds. Comfort and succour all prisoners, especially those who are condemned to die. Give them a right understanding of themselves, and of thy promises; that, trusting wholly in thy mercy, they may not place their confidence anywhere but in thee. Relieve the distressed, protect the innocent, awaken the guilty; and forasmuch as thou alone bringest light out of darkness, and good out of evil,  grant to these thy servants, that by the power of thy Holy Spirit they may be set free from the chains of sin, and may be brought to newness of life.</em>]<br />
        <br />
      AND be merciful, O Lord, to all whose duties are difficult or burdensome, and comfort them concerning their toil.  Protect the efforts of sober and honest industry. Bless those who labour in works of mercy, in schools of good learning, who care for the aged, little children, the sick and the afflicted, and remember those who travel this day by land, sea and air.</p>
    <p>AND we beseech thee graciously to behold and bless those whom we love, now absent from us. Defend them from all dangers of soul and body; and grant that both they and we, drawing nearer to thee, may be bound together by thy love in the communion of thy Holy Spirit, and in the fellowship of all thy saints.</p>
    <p>AND we do give thee most humble and hearty thanks for all thy goodness and lovingkindness to us, and to all men; We bless thee for our creation, preservation, and all the blessings of this life; but above all, for thine inestimable love in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ; for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory. </p>
    <p> AND, we beseech thee, give us that due sense of all thy mercies, that our hearts may be unfeignedly thankful; and that we show forth thy praise, not only with our lips, but in our lives, by giving up our selves to thy service, and by walking before thee in holiness and righteousness all our days.</p>
    <p>AND finally, we beseech thee to continue thy gracious protection to us this night. Defend us from all dangers and mischiefs, and from the fear of them; that we may enjoy such refreshing sleep as may fit us for the duties of the coming day. And grant us grace always to live in such a state that we may never be afraid to die; so that, living and dying, we may be thine, through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom, with thee and the Holy Ghost, be all honour and glory, world without end. Amen.</p>
    <p align="center"><strong>A Prayer of St. Chrysostom.</strong><br />
    </p>
    <p>Almighty God, who hast given us grace at this time with one accord to make our common supplications unto thee; and dost promise that when two or three are gathered together in thy Name thou wilt grant their requests; Fulfil now, O Lord, the desires and petitions of thy servants, as may be most expedient for them; granting us in this world knowledge of thy truth, and in the world to come life everlasting. Amen.</p>
    <p align="center"><strong>2 Cor. xiii. 14.</strong><br />

    <p>THE grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. Amen.</p>
