      <B>Answer. </B>My Christian Name is ____________.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Question.</B> Who gave you this Name?<BR />
      <B>Answer. </B>My Sponsors gave me this Name in Baptism; wherein
      I was made a member of Christ, the child of God, and an inheritor
      of the kingdom of heaven.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Question. </B>What did your Sponsors then promise for you?<BR />
      Answer. My Sponsors did promise and vow three things in my name:
      First, that I should renounce the devil and all his works, the
      pomps and vanity of this wicked world, and all the sinful lusts
      of the flesh; Secondly, that I should believe all the Articles
      of the Christian Faith; And Thirdly, that I should keep God's
      holy will and commandments, and walk in the same all the days
      of my life.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Question.</B> Do you not think that you are bound so to do?<BR />
      <B>Answer. </B>Yes, verily; and by God's help so I will. And
      I heartily thank our heavenly Father, that he hath called me
      to this state of salvation, through Jesus Christ our Saviour.
      And I pray unto God to give me his grace, that I may continue
      in the same unto my life's end.</P>

      <P><BR />
      I BELIEVE in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth:
      And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord: Who was conceived
      by the Holy Ghost, Born of the Virgin Mary: Suffered under Pontius
      Pilate, Was crucified, dead, and buried: He descended into hell;
      The third day he rose again from the dead: He ascended into heaven,
      And sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty: From
      thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead. I believe
      in the Holy Ghost: The holy Catholic Church; The Communion of
      Saints: The Forgiveness of sins: The Resurrection of the body:
      And the Life everlasting. Amen.</P>

      <H6><I><BR />

      of your Belief?<BR />
      <B>Answer. </B>First, I learn to believe in God the Father, who
      hath made me, and all the world.<BR />
      Secondly, in God the Son, who hath redeemed me, and all mankind.<BR />
      Thirdly, in God the Holy Ghost, who sanctifieth me, and all the
      people of God. And this Holy Trinity, One God, I praise and magnify,
      saying,</P>

      <H6><CENTER><I>&para; Minister and People.</I></CENTER></H6>

      <P>GLORY be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;
      As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world
      without end. Amen.</P>

      <H6><I><BR />

      <P><A NAME="anchor1683031"></A><BR />
      ALMIGHTY God, Who alone canst order the unruly wills and affections
      of sinful men; Grant unto thy people, That they may love the
      thing which thou commandest, And desire that which thou dost
      promise; That so, among the sundry and manifold changes of the
      world, Our hearts may surely there be fixed, Where true joys
      are to be found; Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</P>

      <H6><I>&para; Then shall the Minister repeat the Ten Commandments,
      and after every Commandment the People shall say the response.
      But NOTE, That where so instructed, the People may repeat the
      Commandments, the Minister saying the response. And NOTE further,

<BR />
      II. Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven image, nor the
      likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth
      beneath, or in the water under the earth; thou shalt not bow
      down to them, nor worship them; [for I the LORD thy God am a
      jealous God, and visit the sins of the fathers upon the children,
      unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; and
      show mercy unto thou sands in them that love me and keep my commandments.]<BR />
<BR />
      Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this
      law.<BR />
<BR />
      III. Thou shalt not take the Name of the LORD thy God in vain;<BR />

      in vain.]<BR />
<BR />
      Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this
      law.<BR />
<BR />
      IV. Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath-day. [Six days shalt
      thou labour, and do all that thou hast to do; but the seventh
      day is the Sabbath of the LORD thy God. In it thou shalt do no
      manner of work, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, thy man-servant,
      and thy maid-servant, thy cattle, and the stranger that is within
      thy gates. For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the
      sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore
      the LORD blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it.]<BR />
      <I><BR />
      Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this
      law.</I><BR />

      law.</I><BR />
<BR />
      VI. Thou shalt do no murder.<BR />
      <I><BR />
      Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this
      law.</I><BR />
<BR />
      VII. Thou shalt not commit adultery.<BR />
      <I><BR />
      Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this

<BR />
      IX. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.<BR />
      <I><BR />
      Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this
      law.</I><BR />
<BR />
      X. Thou shalt not covet [thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not
      covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his servant, nor his maid, nor
      his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is his.]<BR />
      <I><BR />
      Lord, have mercy upon us, and write all these thy laws in our
      hearts, we beseech thee.</I></P>

      <H6><CENTER><I>&para; Then shall the Minister say,</I></CENTER></H6>

      <P>GRANT to us, Lord, we beseech thee, the spirit to think and
      do always such things as are right; that we, who cannot do any
      thing that is good without thee, may by thee be enabled to live
      according to thy will; through Jesus Christ our Lord<I>. Amen.</I></P>

      <P><BR />
      <B>Question. </B>What does our Lord Jesus Christ teach us about
      these Commandments?<BR />

      summed up in these two Commandments: Thou shalt love the Lord
      thy God with all thy heart, with all thy mind, with all thy soul,
      and with all thy strength; this is the first and great Commandment.
      And the second is: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Question. </B>What then do you chiefly learn from the Ten
      Commandments?<BR />
      <B>Answer.</B> I learn two things from these Commandments; my
      duty towards God, and my duty towards my Neighbour.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Question. </B>What is your duty towards God?<BR />
      <B>Answer.</B> My duty towards God is To believe in him, to fear

      myself, and to do to all men as I would they should do unto me:<BR />
<BR />
      V. To love, honour, and help my father and mother: To honour
      and obey the civil authority: To submit myself to all my governors,
      teachers, spiritual pastors and masters: And to order myself
      in that lowliness and reverence which becometh a servant of God:<BR />
<BR />
      VI. To hurt nobody by word or deed: To bear no malice nor hatred
      in my heart:<BR />
<BR />
      VII. To keep my body in temperance, soberness, and chastity:<BR />
<BR />
      VIII. To keep my hands from picking and stealing: To be true
      and just in all my dealings:<BR />
<BR />
      IX. To keep my tongue from evil speaking, lying, and slandering:<BR />
<BR />
      X. Not to covet nor desire other men's goods; But to learn and
      labour truly to earn mine own living, And to do my duty in that
      state of life unto which it shall please God to call me.</P>

      <H6><CENTER><I>&para; Then shall be sung a Hymn, after which
      the Minister shall say as followeth.</I></CENTER></H6>

      <P>KNOW this; that you are not able to do these things of yourself,
      nor to walk in the Commandments of God, and to serve him, without
      his special grace; which you must learn at all times to call
      for by diligent prayer. What is the prayer that our Lord taught
      us to pray?<BR />
      <B>Answer. </B>The Lord's Prayer.<BR />
<BR />
      Minister. Let us pray, as our Saviour Christ hath taught us,
      and say,</P>

      <H6><CENTER><I>&para; Then shall be said by the Minister and
      People together, all kneeling,</I></CENTER></H6>

      <P>OUR Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom
      come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us
      this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we
      forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation,
      But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power,
      and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.<BR />
<BR />
      THE grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and
      the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. <I>Amen.</I><BR />

<BR />
      <B>Minister. </B>Show thy servants thy work;<BR />
      <B>People.</B> And their children thy glory.<BR />
      <B>Minister. </B>Let thy merciful kindness, O Lord, be upon us;<BR />
      <B>People. </B>As we do put our trust in thee.<BR />
      <B>Minister. </B>Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us,<BR />
      <B>People.</B> But unto thy Name be the praise.<BR />
      <B>Minister. </B>Lord, hear our prayer.<BR />
      <B>People.</B> And let our cry come unto thee.<BR />

      <B>Minister. </B>Let us pray.<BR />
<BR />
      O ALMIGHTY God, who hast built thy Church upon the foundation
      of the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the
      head corner-stone; Grant us so to be joined together in unity
      of spirit by their doctrine, that we may be made an holy temple
      acceptable unto thee; through the same Jesus Christ our Lord.
      <I>Amen.</I></P>

      <P><BR />
      WHEN were you made a member of the Church?<BR />
      <B>Answer. </B>I was made a member of the Church when I was baptized.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Question. </B>What is the Church?<BR />
      <B>Answer. </B>The Church is the Body of which Jesus Christ is
      the Head, and all baptized people are the members.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Question.</B> How is the Church described in the Apostles'
      and Nicene Creeds?<BR />
      <B>Answer. </B>The Church is described in the Creeds as One,
      Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Question.</B> What do we mean by these words?<BR />
      <B>Answer. </B>We mean that the Church is One; because it is
      one Body under one Head; Holy; because the Holy Spirit dwells
      in it, and sanctifies its members; Catholic; because it is universal,
      holding earnestly the Faith for all time, in all countries, and
      for all people; and is sent to preach the Gospel to the whole
      world; Apostolic; because it continues stedfastly in the Apostles'
      teaching and fellowship.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Question.</B><A NAME="anchor144127"></A> What is your bounden
      duty as a member of the Church?<BR />
      <B>Answer</B>. My bounden duty is to follow Christ, to worship
      God every Sunday in his Church; and to work and pray and give
      for the spread of his kingdom.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Question. </B>What special means does the Church provide to
      help you to do all these things?<BR />
      <B>Answer. </B>The Church provides the Laying on of Hands, or
      Confirmation, wherein, after renewing the promises and vows of
      my Baptism, and declaring my loyalty and devotion to Christ as
      my Master, I receive the strengthening gifts of the Holy Spirit.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Question. </B>After you have been confirmed, what great privilege
      doth our Lord provide for you?<BR />
      <B>Answer. </B>Our Lord provides the Sacrament of the Lord's
      Supper, or Holy Communion, for the continual strengthening and
      refreshing of my soul.</P>

      <H6><I><BR />
      &para; After another Hymn, the Minister shall proceed with the
      Questions on the Sacraments, as followeth.</I></H6>

      <P><BR />
      HOW many Sacraments hath Christ ordained in his Church?<BR />
      <B>Answer. </B>Christ hath ordained two Sacraments only, as generally
      necessary to salvation; that is to say, Baptism, and the Supper
      of the Lord.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Question. </B>What do you mean by this word Sacrament?<BR />
      <B>Answer.</B> I mean by this word Sacrament an outward and visible
      sign of an inward and spiritual grace given unto us; ordained
      by Christ himself, as a means whereby we receive this grace,
      and a pledge to assure us thereof.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Question.</B> How many parts are there in a Sacrament?<BR />
      <B>Answer. </B>There are two parts in a Sacrament; the outward
      and visible sign, and the inward and spiritual grace.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Question. </B>What is the outward and visible sign or form
      in Baptism?<BR />
      <B>Answer.</B> The outward and visible sign or form in Baptism
      is Water; wherein the person is baptized, In the Name of the
      Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Question. </B>What is the inward and spiritual grace in Baptism?<BR />
      <B>Answer.</B> The inward and spiritual grace in Baptism is a
      death unto sin, and a new birth unto righteousness; whereby we
      are made the children of grace.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Question. </B>What is required of persons to be baptized?<BR />
      <B>Answer. </B>Repentance, whereby they forsake sin; and Faith,
      whereby they stedfastly believe the promises of God to them in
      that Sacrament.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Question.</B> Why then are infants baptized, when by reason
      of their tender age they cannot perform them?<BR />
      <B>Answer. </B>Because, by the faith of their Sponsors, infants
      are received into Christ's Church, become the recipients of his
      grace, and are trained in the household of faith.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Question.</B> Why was the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper ordained?<BR />
      <B>Answer. </B>The Sacrament of the Lord's Supper was ordained
      for the continual remembrance of the sacrifice of the death of
      Christ, and of the benefits which we receive thereby.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Question.</B> What is the outward part or sign of the Lord's
      Supper?<BR />
      <B>Answer. </B>The outward part or sign of the Lord's Supper
      is, Bread and Wine, which the Lord hath commanded to be received.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Question. </B>What is the inward part, or thing signified?<BR />
      <B>Answer.</B> The inward part, or thing signified, is the Body
      and Blood of Christ, which are spiritually taken and received
      by the faithful in the Lord's Supper.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Question.</B> What are the benefits whereof we are partakers
      in the Lord's Supper?<BR />
      <B>Answer. </B>The benefits whereof we are partakers in the Lord's
      Supper are the strengthening and refreshing of our souls by the
      Body and Blood of Christ, as our bodies are strengthened and
      refreshed by the Bread and Wine.<BR />
<BR />
      <B>Question. </B>What is required of those who come to the Lord's
      Supper?<BR />
      <B>Answer. </B>It is required of those who come to the Lord's
      Supper to examine themselves, whether they repent them truly
      of their former sins, with stedfast purpose to lead a new life;
      to have a lively faith in God's mercy through Christ, with a
      thankful remembrance of his death; and to be in charity with
      all men.</P>

      in faith, and love, and true repentance, we may receive remission
      of our sins, and be filled with thy grace and heavenly benediction;
      through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<BR />
<BR />
      THE grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and
      the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. Amen.</P>

      <H6><BR />
      <I>&para; The Minister of every Parish shall diligently, upon
      Sundays and Holy Days, or on some other convenient occasions,
      openly in the Church, instruct or examine the Youth of his Parish.<BR />
      &para; And all Fathers, Mothers, Guardians, and Sponsors shall
      bring those, for whose religious nurture they are responsible,
