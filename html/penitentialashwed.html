to the multitude of thy mercies do away mine offences.<BR>Wash me throughly from my wickedness, * and cleanse me from my
sin.<BR>For I acknowledge my faults, * and my sin is ever before me.<BR>Against thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight;
* that thou mightest be justified in thy saying, and clear when
thou art judged.<BR>Behold, I was shapen in wickedness, * and in sin hath my mother
conceived me.<BR>But lo, thou requirest truth in the inward parts, * and shalt
make me to understand wisdom secretly.<BR>Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; * thou
shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.<BR>Thou shalt make me hear of joy and gladness, * that the bones
which thou hast broken may rejoice.<BR>Turn thy face from my sins, * and put out all my mis- deeds.<BR>Make me a clean heart, O God, * and renew a right spirit within
me.<BR>Cast me not away from thy presence, * and take not thy holy Spirit
from me.<BR>O give me the comfort of thy help again, * and stablish me with
thy free Spirit.<BR>Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked, * and sinners shall
be converted unto thee.<BR>Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou that art the God
of my health; * and my tongue shall sing of thy righteousness.<BR>Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord, * and my mouth shall show thy
praise.<BR>For thou desirest no sacrifice, else would I give it thee; but
thou delightest not in burnt-offerings.<BR>The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit: * a broken and contrite
heart, O God, shalt thou not despise.<BR>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost;<BR>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, * world
without end. Amen.</P><H6><BR><I>&para; If the Litany hath been already said. the Minister may
pass at once to </I>O Lord, save thy servants; etc.</H6><P><BR>Lord, have mercy upon us.<BR><B>Christ, have mercy upon us.</B><BR>Lord, have mercy upon us.<BR><BR>Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom
come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this
day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive
those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation,
But deliver us from evil. Amen.<BR><BR>O Lord, save thy servants;<BR><B>That put their trust in thee. </B><BR>Send unto them help from above.<BR><B>And evermore mightily defend them.</B><BR>Help us, O God our Saviour.<BR><B>And for the glory of thy Name deliver us; be merciful to us
sinners, for thy Name's sake. </B><BR>O Lord, hear our prayer.<BR><B>And let our cry come unto thee.</B><BR><BR>Let us pray.<BR>O Lord, we beseech thee, mercifully hear our prayers, and spare
all those who confess their sins unto thee; that they, whose consciences
by sin are accused, by thy merciful pardon may be absolved; through
Christ our Lord. Amen.<BR><BR>O Most mighty God, and merciful Father, who hast compassion upon
all men, and who wouldest not the death of a sinner, but rather
that he should turn from his sin, and be saved; Mercifully forgive
us our trespasses; receive and comfort us, who are grieved and
wearied with the burden of our sins. Thy property is always to
have mercy; to thee only it appertaineth to forgive sins. Spare
us therefore, good Lord, spare thy people, whom thou hast redeemed;
enter not into judgment with thy servants; but so turn thine anger
from us, who meekly acknowledge our transgressions, and truly
repent us of our faults, and so make haste to help us in this
world, that we may ever live with thee in the world to come; through
Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</P><H6><I><BR>&para; Then shall the People say this that followeth, after the
Minister.</I></H6><P><BR>Turn thou us, O good Lord, and so shall we be turned. Be favourable,
O Lord, Be favourable to thy people, Who turn to thee in weeping,
fasting, and praying. For thou art a merciful God, Full of compassion,
Long-suffering, and of great pity. Thou sparest when we deserve
punishment, And in thy wrath thinkest upon mercy. Spare thy people,
good Lord, spare them, And let not thine heritage be brought to
confusion. Hear us, O Lord, for thy mercy is great, And after
the multitude of thy mercies look upon us; Through the merits
and mediation of thy blessed Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</P><H6><I><BR>&para; Then the Minister shall say,</I></H6><P><BR>O GOD, whose nature and property is ever to have mercy and to
forgive; Receive our humble petitions; and though we be tied and
bound with the chain of our sins, yet let the pitifulness of thy
great mercy loose us; for the honour of Jesus Christ, our Mediator
and Advocate. Amen.<BR><BR>THE LORD bless us, and keep us. The LORD make his face to shine
upon us, and be gracious unto us. The LORD lift up his countenance
upon us, and give us peace, both now and evermore. Amen.<BR><HR ALIGN=LEFT><BR><P><CENTER>Go to <A HREF="index.html">1928 Book of Common Prayer</A></CENTER>
