following, with Antiphon and Collect.</I></H6><P><BR><B>Antiphon. </B>I did call upon the LORD with my voice; And
he heard me out of his holy hill.<BR><BR><B>Domine, quid multiplicati? Psalm iii.</B><BR>LORD, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they that
rise against me.<BR>Many one there be that say of my soul, There is no help for him
in his God.<BR>But thou, O LORD, art my defender; thou art my worship, and the
lifter up of my head.<BR>I did call upon the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of
his holy hill.<BR>I laid me down and slept, and rose up again; for the LORD sustained
me.<BR>Salvation belongeth unto the LORD; and thy blessing is upon thy
people.<BR><P><CENTER><I>The Collect.</I></CENTER><P>HEAR us, Almighty and most merciful God and Saviour; extend
thy accustomed goodness to this thy servant who is grieved with
sickness. Visit<I> him, </I>O Lord, with thy loving mercy, and
so restore <I>him </I>to<I> his </I>former health, that<I> he
</I>may give thanks unto thee in thy holy Church; through Jesus
Christ our Lord. Amen.<BR><BR><I>Antiphon.</I> I will go unto the altar of God; Unto the God
of my joy and gladness.<BR><BR><B>Judica me, Deus. Psalm xliii.</B><BR>GIVE sentence with me, O God, and defend my cause against the
ungodly people; O deliver me from the deceitful and wicked man.<BR>For thou art the God of my strength; why hast thou put me from
thee? and why go I so heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?<BR>O send out thy light and thy truth, that they may lead me, and
bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy dwelling;<BR>And that I may go unto the altar of God, even unto the God of
my joy and gladness; and upon the harp will I give thanks unto
thee, O God, my God.<BR>Why art thou so heavy, O my soul? and why art thou so disquieted
within me?<BR>O put thy trust in God; for I will yet give him thanks, which
is the help of my countenance, and my God.<BR><P><CENTER><A NAME=anchor7744444></A><I>The Collect.</I></CENTER><P>SANCTIFY, we beseech thee, O Lord, the sickness of this thy
servant; that the sense of <I>his </I>weakness may add strength
to<I> his </I>faith, and seriousness to <I>his </I>repentance;
and grant that<I> he </I>may dwell with thee in life everlasting;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<BR><BR><B>Antiphon. </B>I have considered the days of old; And the years
that are past.<BR><BR><B>Voce mea ad Dominum. Psalm lxxvii.</B><BR>I WILL cry unto God with my voice; even unto God will I cry with
my voice, and he shall hearken unto me.<BR>In the time of my trouble I sought the Lord: I stretched forth
my hands unto him, and ceased not in the night season; my soul
refused comfort.<BR>When I am in heaviness, I will think upon God; when my heart
is vexed, I will complain.<BR>Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so feeble that I cannot speak.<BR>I have considered the days of old, and the years that are past.<BR>I call to remembrance my song, and in the night I commune with
mine own heart, and search out my spirit.<BR>Will the Lord absent himself for ever? and will he be no more
intreated?<BR>Is his mercy clean gone for ever? and is his promise come utterly
to an end for evermore?<BR>Hath God forgotten to be gracious? and will he shut up his loving-kindness
in displeasure?<BR>And I said, It is mine own infirmity; but I will remember the
years of the right hand of the Most Highest.<BR><P><CENTER><I>The Collect.</I></CENTER><P>HEAR, O Lord, we beseech thee, these our prayers, as we call
upon thee on behalf of this thy servant; and bestow upon <I>him</I>
the help of thy merciful consolation; through Jesus Christ our
Lord. Amen.<BR><BR><B>Antiphon. </B>Though I walk in the midst of trouble; Yet shalt
thou refresh me.<BR><BR><B>Confitebor tibi. Psalm cxxxviii.</B><BR>I WILL give thanks unto thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; even
before the gods will I sing praise unto thee.<BR>I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy Name, because
of thy loving-kindness and truth; for thou hast magnified thy
Name, and thy word, above all things.<BR>When I called upon thee, thou heardest me; and enduedst my soul
with much strength.<BR>Though I walk in the midst of trouble, yet shalt thou refresh
me; thou shalt stretch forth thy hand upon the furiousness of
mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.<BR>The LORD shall make good his loving-kindness toward me; yea,
thy mercy, O LORD, endureth for ever; despise not then the works
of thine own hands.<BR><P><CENTER><I>The Collect.</I></CENTER><P><A NAME=anchor7760322></A>O GOD, the strength of the weak
and the comfort of sufferers; Mercifully accept our prayers,
and grant to thy servant the help of thy power, that<I> his </I>sickness
may be turned into health, and our sorrow into joy; through Jesus
Christ our Lord. Amen.<BR><BR><B>Antiphon. </B>The LORD saveth thy life from destruction; And
crowneth thee with mercy and loving-kindness.<BR><B><BR>Benedic, anima mea. Psalm ciii.</B><BR>PRAISE the LORD, O my soul; and all that is within me, praise
his holy Name.<BR>Praise the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:<BR>Who forgiveth all thy sin, and healeth all thine infirmities;<BR>Who saveth thy life from destruction, and crowneth thee with
mercy and loving-kindness.<BR>O praise the LORD, ye angels of his, ye that excel in strength;
ye that fulfil his commandment, and hearken unto the voice of
his word.<BR>O praise the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye servants of his that
do his pleasure.<BR>O speak good of the LORD, all ye works of his, in all places
of his dominion: praise thou the LORD, O my soul.<BR><P><CENTER><I>The Collect.</I></CENTER><P>ACCEPT, we beseech thee, merciful Lord, the devout praise
of thy humble servant; and grant<I> him </I>an abiding sense
of thy loving-kindness; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</P><H6><I>&para; Any of the following Psalms, 20, 27, 42, 91, 121,
146, may, at the discretion of the Minister, be substituted for
any of those given above.</I></H6><H6><CENTER>&para; Here shall be said,</CENTER></H6><P>O SAVIOUR of the world, who by thy Cross and precious Blood
hast redeemed us;<BR>Save us, and help us, we humbly beseech thee, O Lord.</P><H6><I>&para; As occasion demands, the Minister shall address
the sick person on the meaning and use of the time of sickness,
and the opportunity it affords for spiritual profit.<BR>&para; Here may the Minister inquire of the sick person as to
his acceptance of the Christian Faith, and as to whether he repent
him truly of his sins, and be in charity with all the world;
exhorting him to forgive, from the bottom of his heart, all persons
that have offended him; and if he hath offended any other, to
ask them forgiveness; and where he hath done injury or wrong
to any man, that he make amends to the uttermost of his power.<BR>&para; Then shall the sick person be moved to make a special
confession of his sins, if he feel his conscience troubled with
any matter; after which confession, on evidence of his repentance,
the Minister shall assure him of God's mercy and forgiveness.</I></H6><H6><CENTER>&para; Then the Minister shall say,</CENTER></H6><P><CENTER>Let us pray.</CENTER><P>O MOST merciful God, who, according to the multitude of thy
mercies, dost so put away the sins of those who truly repent,
that thou rememberest them no more; Open thine eye of mercy upon
this thy servant, who most earnestly desireth pardon and forgiveness.
Renew in <I>him,</I> most loving Father, whatsoever hath been
decayed by the fraud and malice of the devil, or by<I> his </I>own
carnal will and frailness; preserve and continue this sick member
in the unity of the Church; consider<I> his </I>contrition, accept
<I>his </I>tears, assuage <I>his </I>pain, as shall seem to thee
most expedient for <I>him. </I>And forasmuch as <I>he</I> putteth<I>
his </I>full trust only in thy mercy, impute not unto <I>him</I>
<I>his </I>former sins, but strengthen <I>him</I> with thy blessed
Spirit; and, when thou art pleased to take <I>him </I>hence,
take <I>him </I>unto thy favour; through the merits of thy most
dearly beloved Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</P><H6><CENTER><I>&para; Then shall the Minister say,</I></CENTER></H6><P>THE Almighty Lord, who is a most strong tower to all those
who put their trust in him, to whom all things in heaven, in
earth, and under the earth, do bow and obey; Be now and evermore
thy defence; and make thee know and feel, that there is none
other Name under heaven given to man, in whom, and through whom,
thou mayest receive health and salvation, but only the Name of
our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</P><H6><I>&para; Here the Minister may use any part of the service
of the Book, which, in his discretion, he shall think convenient
to the occasion; and after that shall say,</I></H6><P><BR>UNTO God's gracious mercy and protection we commit thee. The
LORD bless thee, and keep thee. The LORD make his face to shine
upon thee, and be gracious unto thee. The LORD lift up his countenance
upon thee, and give thee peace, both now and evermore. Amen.<BR><P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR=#ff0000>PRAYERS.</FONT></B></CENTER></P><H6><I>&para; These Prayers may be said with the foregoing Service,

drivest away from men's bodies all sickness and all infirmity;
Be present in thy goodness with this thy servant, that <I>his</I>
weakness may be banished and <I>his </I>strength recalled; that
<I>his </I>health being thereupon restored,<I> he</I> may bless
thy holy Name; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<BR><P><CENTER><A NAME=anchor7808759></A><I><FONT COLOR=#ff0000>A

Thanksgiving for the Beginning of a Recovery.</FONT></I></CENTER><P>GREAT and mighty God, who bringest down to the grave, and
bringest up again; We bless thy wonderful goodness, for having
turned our heaviness into joy and our mourning into gladness,
by restoring this our <I>brother </I>to some degree of <I>his</I>
former health. Blessed be thy Name that thou didst not forsake
<I>him</I> in his sickness; but didst visit <I>him</I> with comforts
from above; didst support<I> him</I> in patience and submission
to thy will; and at last didst send <I>him</I> seasonable relief.
Perfect, we beseech thee, this thy mercy towards <I>him;</I>
and prosper the means which shall be made use of for<I> his </I>cure:
that, being restored to health of body, vigour of mind, and cheerfulness
of spirit, <I>he </I>may be able to go to thine house, to offer
thee an oblation with great gladness, and to bless thy holy Name
for all thy goodness towards <I>him;</I> through Jesus Christ
our Saviour, to whom, with thee and the Holy Spirit, be all honour
and glory, world without end. Amen.<BR><P><CENTER><A NAME=anchor1563953></A></CENTER><P><CENTER><I><FONT COLOR=#ff0000>A Prayer for a Sick Person,
when there appeareth but small hope of Recovery.</FONT></I></CENTER><P>O FATHER of mercies, and God of all comfort, our only help
in time of need; We fly unto thee for succour in behalf of this
thy servant, here lying in great weakness of body. Look graciously
upon <I>him, </I>O Lord; and the more the outward man decayeth,
strengthen<I> him,</I> we beseech thee, so much the more continually
with thy grace and Holy Spirit in the inner man. Give<I> him</I>
unfeigned repentance for all the errors of <I>his</I> life past,
and stedfast faith in thy Son Jesus; that <I>his </I>sins may
be done away by thy mercy, and<I> his </I>pardon sealed in heaven;
through the same thy Son, our Lord and Saviour. Amen.<BR><P><CENTER><A NAME=anchor7972292></A></CENTER><P><CENTER><I><FONT COLOR=#ff0000>A Prayer for the Despondent.</FONT></I></CENTER><P>COMFORT, we beseech thee, most gracious God, this thy servant,
cast down and faint of heart amidst the sorrows and difficulties
of the world; and grant that, by the power of thy Holy Spirit,<I>
he </I>may be enabled to go upon his way rejoicing, and give
thee continual thanks for thy sustaining providence; through
Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<BR><P><CENTER><A NAME=anchor8002536></A></CENTER><P><CENTER><I><FONT COLOR=#ff0000>A Prayer which may be said
by the Minister in behalf of all present at the Visitation.</FONT></I></CENTER><P>O GOD, whose days are without end, and whose mercies cannot
be numbered; Make us, we beseech thee, deeply sensible of the
shortness and uncertainty of human life; and let thy Holy Spirit
lead us in holiness and righteousness, all our days: that, when
we shall have served thee in our generation, we may be gathered
unto our fathers, having the testimony of a good conscience;
in the communion of the Catholic Church; in the confidence of
a certain faith; in the comfort of a reasonable, religious, and
holy hope; in favour with thee our God, and in perfect charity
with the world. All which we ask through Jesus Christ our Lord.
Amen.<BR><P><CENTER><I><FONT COLOR=#ff0000>A Commendatory Prayer for

made perfect, after they are delivered from their earthly prisons;
We humbly commend the soul of this thy servant, our dear<I> brother,
</I>into thy hands, as into the hands of a faithful Creator,
and most merciful Saviour; beseeching thee, that it may be precious
in thy sight. Wash it, we pray thee, in the blood of that immaculate
Lamb, that was slain to take away the sins of the world; that
whatsoever defilements it may have contracted, through the lusts
of the flesh or the wiles of Satan, being purged and done away,
it may be presented pure and without spot before thee; through
the merits of Jesus Christ thine only Son our Lord.
