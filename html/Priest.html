<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Form and Manner of Ordering Priests (1928 BCP)</TITLE><BODY BGCOLOR=#ffffff><H1><CENTER><FONT COLOR=#ff0000>THE FORM AND MANNER<BR>OF ORDERING PRIESTS</FONT></CENTER></H1><H6><I>&para; When the day appointed by the Bishop is come, there
shall be a Sermon or Exhortation, declaring the Duty and Office
of such as come to be admitted Priests; how necessary that Order
is in the Church of Christ, and also, how the People ought to
esteem them in their Office.<BR><BR>&para; A Priest shall present unto the Bishop, sitting in his
chair near to the Holy Table, all those who are to receive the
Order of Priesthood that day, each of them being decently habited,
and shall say,</I></H6><P><BR>REVEREND Father in God, I present unto you these persons present,
to be admitted to the Order of Priesthood.</P><H6><CENTER><I>&para; The Bishop.</I></CENTER></H6><P><BR>TAKE heed that the persons, whom ye present unto us, be apt and
meet, for their learning and godly conversation, to exercise their
Ministry duly, to the honour of God, and the edifying of his Church.</P><H6><CENTER><I>&para; The Priest shall answer,</I></CENTER></H6><P><BR>I HAVE inquired concerning them, and also examined them, and think
them so to be.</P><H6><CENTER><I>&para; Then the Bishop shall say unto the People,</I></CENTER></H6><P><BR>GOOD People, these are they whom we purpose, God willing, to receive
this day unto the holy Office of Priesthood; for, after due examination,
we find not to the contrary, but that they are lawfully called
to their Function and Ministry, and that they are persons meet
for the same. But yet, if there be any of you who knoweth any
Impediment, or notable Crime, in any of them, for the which he
ought not to be received into this holy Ministry, let him come
forth in the Name of God, and show what the Crime or Impediment
is.</P><H6><I>&para; And if any great Crime or Impediment be objected,
the Bishop shall cease from Ordering that person, until such time
as the party accused shall be found clear of that Crime.<BR><BR>&para; Then the Bishop (commending such as shall be found meet
to be Ordered, to the Prayers of the congregation) shall, with
the Clergy and People present, say the Litany.<BR><BR>&para; And NOTE, That after the Suffrage, That it may please thee
to illuminate all Bishops, etc., shall be said the following Suffrage:</I></H6><P><BR>THAT it may please thee to bless these thy servants, now to be
admitted to the Order of Priests, and to pour thy grace upon them;
that they may duly exercise their Office, to the edifying of thy
Church, and the glory of thy holy Name;</P><H6><I><BR>&para; And NOTE further, That in the discretion of the Bishop,
instead of the Litany appointed, may be said the Litany for Ordinations.<BR><BR>&para; Then shall be said the Service for the Communion, with
the Collect, Epistle, and Gospel, as followeth.</I></H6><P><CENTER>The Collect.</CENTER><P>ALMIGHTY God, giver of all good things, who by thy Holy Spirit
hast appointed divers Orders of Ministers in thy Church; Mercifully
behold these thy servants now called to the Office of Priesthood;
and so replenish them with the truth of thy Doctrine, and adorn
them with innocency of life, that, both by word and good example,
they may faithfully serve thee in this Office, to the glory of
thy Name, and the edification of thy Church; through the merits
of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth with thee
and the same Holy Spirit, world without end. Amen.<BR><P><CENTER>The Epistle. <I>Ephesians iv. 7.</I></CENTER><P>UNTO every one of us is given grace according to the measure
of the gift of Christ. Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up
on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. (Now
that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first
into the lower parts of the earth? He that descended is the same
also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill
all things.) And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and
some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting
of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying
of the body of Christ: till we all come in the unity of the faith,
and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto
the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.<BR><P><CENTER>The Gospel.<I> St. Matthew ix. 36.</I></CENTER><P>WHEN Jesus saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion
on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad as sheep
having no shepherd. Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest
truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few; pray ye therefore
the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into
his harvest.</P><H6><CENTER><I>&para; Or else.</I></CENTER></H6><P><CENTER>The Gospel. <I>St. John x. 1.</I></CENTER><P>VERILY, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the
door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same
is a thief and a robber. But he that entereth in by the door is
the shepherd of the sheep. To him the porter openeth; and the
sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and
leadeth them out. And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he
goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his
voice. And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from
him: for they know not the voice of strangers. This parable spake
Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were
which he spake unto them. Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily,
verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep. All that ever
came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not
hear them. I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall
be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. The thief
cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am
come that they might have life, and that they might have it more
abundantly. I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his
life for the sheep. But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd,
whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth
the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth
the sheep. The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and
careth not for the sheep. I am the good shepherd; and know my
sheep, and am known of mine, even as the Father knoweth me, and
I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep. And other
sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring,
and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one flock, and
one shepherd.</P><H6><I>&para; Then, the People being seated, the Bishop shall
say unto those who are to be ordained Priests as followeth.</I></H6><P><BR>YE have heard, Brethren, as well in your private examination,
as in the exhortation which was now made to you, and in the holy
Lessons taken out of the Gospel, and the writings of the Apostles,
of what dignity, and of how great importance this Office is, whereunto
ye are called. And now again we exhort you, in the Name of our
Lord Jesus Christ, that ye have in remembrance, into how high
a Dignity, and to how weighty an Office and Charge ye are called:
that is to say, to be Messengers, Watchmen, and Stewards of the
Lord; to teach, and to premonish, to feed and provide for the
Lord's family; to seek for Christ's sheep that are dispersed abroad,
and for his children who are in the midst of this naughty world,
that they may be saved through Christ for ever.<BR><BR>Have always therefore printed in your remembrance, how great a
treasure is committed to your charge. For they are the sheep of
Christ, which he bought with his death, and for whom he shed his
blood. The Church and Congregation whom you must serve, is his
Spouse, and his Body. And if it shall happen that the same Church,
or any Member thereof, do take any hurt or hindrance by reason
of your negligence, ye know the greatness of the fault, and also
the horrible punishment that will ensue. Wherefore consider with
yourselves the end of the Ministry towards the children of God,
towards the Spouse and Body of Christ; and see that ye never cease
your labour, your care and diligence, until ye have done all that
lieth in you, according to your bounden duty, to bring all such
as are or shall be committed to your charge, unto that agreement
in the faith and knowledge of God, and to that ripeness and perfectness
of age in Christ, that there be no place left among you, either
for error in religion, or for viciousness in life.<BR><BR>Forasmuch then as your Office is both of so great excellency,
and of so great difficulty, ye see with how great care and study
ye ought to apply yourselves, as well to show yourselves dutiful
and thankful unto that Lord, who hath placed you in so high a
dignity; as also to beware that neither you yourselves offend,
nor be occasion that others offend. Howbeit, ye cannot have a
mind and will thereto of yourselves; for that will and ability
is given of God alone: therefore ye ought, and have need, to pray
earnestly for his Holy Spirit. And seeing that ye cannot by any
other means compass the doing of so weighty a work, pertaining
to the salvation of man, but with doctrine and exhortation taken
out of the Holy Scriptures, and with a life agreeable to the same;
consider how studious ye ought to be in reading and learning the
Scriptures, and in framing the manners both of yourselves, and
of them that specially pertain unto you, according to the rule
of the same Scriptures; and for this self-same cause, how ye ought
to forsake and set aside, as much as ye may, all worldly cares
and studies.<BR><BR>We have good hope that ye have well weighed these things with
yourselves, long before this time; and that ye have clearly determined,
by God's grace, to give yourselves wholly to this Office, whereunto
it hath pleased God to call you: so that, as much as lieth in
you, ye will apply yourselves wholly to this one thing, and draw
all your cares and studies this way; and that ye will continually
pray to God the Father, by the mediation of our only Saviour Jesus
Christ, for the heavenly assistance of the Holy Ghost; that, by
daily reading and weighing the Scriptures, ye may wax riper and
stronger in your Ministry; and that ye may so endeavour yourselves,
from time to time, to sanctify the lives of you and yours, and
to fashion them after the Rule and Doctrine of Christ, that ye
may be wholesome and godly examples and patterns for the people
to follow.<BR><BR>And now, that this present Congregation of Christ may also understand
your minds and wills in these things, and that this your promise
may the more move you to do your duties; ye shall answer plainly
to these things, which we, in the Name of God, and of his Church,
shall demand of you touching the same.<BR><BR>DO you think in your heart, that you are truly called, according
to the will of our Lord Jesus Christ, and according to the Canons
of this Church, to the Order and Ministry of Priesthood?<BR><B>Answer. </B>I think it.<BR><BR><B>Bishop.</B> Are you persuaded that the Holy Scriptures contain
all Doctrine required as necessary for eternal salvation through
faith in Jesus Christ? And are you determined, out of the said
Scriptures to instruct the people committed to your charge; and
to teach nothing, as necessary to eternal salvation, but that
which you shall be persuaded may be concluded and proved by the
Scripture?<BR><B>Answer. </B>I am so persuaded, and have so determined, by God's
grace.<BR><BR><B>Bishop.</B> Will you then give your faithful diligence always
so to minister the Doctrine and Sacraments, and the Discipline
of Christ, as the Lord hath commanded, and as this Church hath
received the same, according to the Commandments of God; so that
you may teach the people committed to your Cure and Charge with
all diligence to keep and observe the same?<BR><B>Answer.</B> I will so do, by the help of the Lord.<BR><BR><B>Bishop. </B>Will you be ready, with all faithful diligence,
to banish and drive away from the Church all erroneous and strange
doctrines contrary to God's Word; and to use both public and private
monitions and exhortations, as well to the sick as to the whole,
within your Cures, as need shall require, and occasion shall be
given?<BR><B>Answer.</B> I will, the Lord being my helper.<BR><BR><B>Bishop.</B> Will you be diligent in Prayers, and in reading
the Holy Scriptures, and in such studies as help to the knowledge
of the same, laying aside the study of the world and the flesh?<BR><B>Answer. </B>I will endeavour so to do, the Lord being my helper.<BR><BR><B>Bishop. </B>Will you be diligent to frame and fashion your
own selves, and your families, according to the Doctrine of Christ;
and to make both yourselves and them, as much as in you lieth,
wholesome examples and patterns to the flock of Christ?<BR><B>Answer.</B> I will apply myself thereto, the Lord being my
helper.<BR><BR><B>Bishop.</B> Will you maintain and set forwards, as much as
lieth in you, quietness, peace, and love, among all Christian
people, and especially among them that are or shall be committed
to your charge?<BR><B>Answer.</B> I will so do, the Lord being my helper.<BR><BR><B>Bishop.</B> Will you reverently obey your Bishop, and other
chief Ministers, who, according to the Canons of the Church, may
have the charge and government over you; following with a glad
mind and will their godly admonitions, and submitting yourselves
to their godly judgments?<BR><B>Answer.</B> I will so do, the Lord being my helper.</P><H6><CENTER>&para; Then, all standing, shall the Bishop say,</CENTER></H6><P><BR>ALMIGHTY God, who hath given you this will to do all these things;
Grant also unto you strength and power to perform the same, that
he may accomplish his work which he hath begun in you; through
Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</P><H6><I><BR>&para; After this, the Congregation shall be desired, secretly
in their Prayers, to make their humble supplications to God for
all these things; for the which Prayers there shall be silence
kept for a space.<BR><BR>&para; After which, the Persons to be ordained Priests kneeling,
and others standing, the Bishop shall sing or say the Veni, Creator
Spiritus; the Bishop beginning, and the Priests, and others that
are present, answering by verses, as followeth.</I></H6><P><CENTER><I>Veni, Creator Spiritus.</I><BR>COME, Holy Ghost, our souls inspire,<BR>And lighten with celestial fire.<BR>Thou the anointing Spirit art,<BR>Who dost thy sevenfold gifts impart.<BR><BR>Thy blessed unction from above,<BR>Is comfort, life, and fire of love.<BR>Enable with perpetual light<BR>The dulness of our blinded sight.<BR><BR>Anoint and cheer our soiled face<BR>With the abundance of thy grace.<BR>Keep far our foes, give peace at home;<BR>Where thou art guide, no ill can come.<BR><BR>Teach us to know the Father, Son,<BR>And thee, of both, to be but One;<BR>That, through the ages all along,<BR>This may be our endless song:<BR>Praise to thy eternal merit,<BR>Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</CENTER></P><H6><CENTER><I>&para; Or this.</I></CENTER></H6><P><CENTER>COME, Holy Ghost, Creator blest,<BR>Vouchsafe within our souls to rest;<BR>Come with thy grace and heavenly aid,<BR>And fill the hearts which thou hast made.<BR><BR>To thee, the Comforter, we cry;<BR>To thee, the Gift of God most high;<BR>The Fount of life, the Fire of love,<BR>The soul's Anointing from above.<BR><BR>The sevenfold gifts of grace are thine,<BR>O Finger of the Hand Divine;<BR>True Promise of the Father thou,<BR>Who dost the tongue with speech endow.<BR><BR>Thy light to every sense impart,<BR>And shed thy love in every heart;<BR>Thine own unfailing might supply<BR>To strengthen our infirmity.<BR><BR>Drive far away our ghostly foe,<BR>And thine abiding peace bestow;<BR>If thou be our preventing Guide,<BR>No evil can our steps betide.</CENTER></P><H6><CENTER><I>&para; That done, the Bishop shall pray in this
wise, and say,</I></CENTER></H6><P><CENTER><BR>Let us pray.</CENTER><P>ALMIGHTY God, and heavenly Father, who, of thine infinite love
and goodness towards us, hast given to us thy only and most dearly
beloved Son Jesus Christ, to be our Redeemer, and the Author of
everlasting life; who, after he had made perfect our redemption
by his death, and was ascended into heaven, sent abroad into the
world his Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Doctors, and Pastors;
by whose labour and ministry he gathered together a great flock
in all the parts of the world, to set forth the eternal praise
of thy holy Name: For these so great benefits of thy eternal goodness,
and for that thou hast vouchsafed to call these thy servants here
present to the same Office and Ministry, appointed for the salvation
of mankind, we render unto thee most hearty thanks, we praise
and worship thee; and we humbly beseech thee, by the same thy
blessed Son, to grant unto all, which either here or elsewhere
call upon thy holy Name, that we may continue to show ourselves
thankful unto thee for these and all thy other benefits; and that
we may daily increase and go forwards in the knowledge and faith
of thee and thy Son, by the Holy Spirit. So that as well by these
thy Ministers, as by them over whom they shall be appointed thy
Ministers, thy holy Name may be for ever glorified, and thy blessed
kingdom enlarged; through the same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord,
who liveth and reigneth with thee in the unity of the same Holy
Spirit, world without end. Amen.</P><H6><I>&para; When this Prayer is done, the Bishop with the Priests
present, shall lay their Hands severally upon the Head of every
one that receiveth the Order of Priesthood; the Receivers humbly
kneeling, and the Bishop saying,</I></H6><P><BR>RECEIVE the Holy Ghost for the Office and Work of a Priest in
the Church of God, now committed unto thee by the Imposition of
our hands. Whose sins thou dost forgive, they are forgiven; and
whose sins thou dost retain, they are retained. And be thou a
faithful Dispenser of the Word of God, and of his holy Sacraments;
In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
Amen.</P><H6><CENTER><I>&para; Or this.</I></CENTER></H6><P><BR>TAKE thou Authority to execute the Office of a Priest in the Church
of God, now committed to thee by the Imposition of our hands.
And be thou a faithful Dispenser of the Word of God, and of his
holy Sacraments; In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and
of the Holy Ghost. Amen.</P><H6><I><BR>&para; Then the Bishop shall deliver to every one of them kneeling,
the Bible into his hand, saying,</I></H6><P><BR>TAKE thou Authority to preach the Word of God, and to minister
the holy Sacraments in the Congregation, where thou shalt be lawfully
appointed thereunto.</P><H6><I>&para; When this is done, the Nicene Creed shall be said,
and the Bishop shall go on in the Service of the Communion, which
all they who receive Orders shall take together, and remain in
the same place where Hands were laid upon them, until such time
as they have received the Communion.<BR><BR>&para; The Communion being done, after the last Collect, and immediately
before the Benediction, shall be said this Collect.</I></H6><P><BR>MOST merciful Father, we beseech thee to send upon these thy servants
thy heavenly blessing; that they may be clothed with righteousness,
and that thy Word spoken by their mouths may have such success,
that it may never be spoken in vain. Grant also, that we may have
grace to hear and receive what they shall deliver out of thy most
holy Word, or agreeable to the same, as the means of our salvation;
that in all our words and deeds we may seek thy glory, and the
increase of thy kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<BR><BR>THE Peace of God, which passeth all understanding, keep your hearts
and minds in the knowledge and love of God, and of his Son Jesus
Christ our Lord: And the Blessing of God Almighty, the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost, be amongst you, and remain with you
always. Amen</P><H6><I>&para; And if, on the same day, the Order of Deacons be
given to some, and the Order of Priesthood to others; the Deacons
shall be first presented, and then the Priests; and it shall suffice
that the Litany be once said for both. The Epistle shall be Ephesians
iv.7 to 13, as before in this Office. Immediately after which,
they that are to be made Deacons, shall be examined and Ordained,
as is above prescribed. Then one of them having read the Gospel,
(which shall be either Saint Matthew ix. 36 to 38, as before in
this Office; or else Saint Luke xii. 35 to 38, as before in the
Form for the Ordering of Deacons,) they that are to be made Priests
shall likewise be examined and Ordained, as is in this Office
before appointed. The Collect shall be as followeth.</I></H6><P><CENTER><I>The Collect.</I></CENTER><P>ALMIGHTY God, giver of all good things, who by thy Holy Spirit
hast appointed divers Orders of Ministers in thy Church; Mercifully
behold these thy servants now called to the Office of Deacon and
these thy servants now called to the Office of Priest; and so
replenish them with the truth of thy Doctrine, and adorn them
with innocency of life, that, both by word and good example, they
may faithfully serve thee in their Ministry, to the glory of thy
Name, and the edification of thy Church; through the merits of
our Saviour Jesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth with thee and
the same Holy Spirit, world without end. Amen.<BR><P><CENTER>Go to <A HREF="index.html">1928 Book of Common Prayer</A></CENTER>
