the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.<BR>Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.<BR>What reward shall I give unto the LORD for all the benefits that
he hath done unto me?<BR>I will receive the cup of salvation, and call upon the Name of
the LORD.<BR>I will pay my vows now in the presence of all his people, in
the courts of the LORD'S house; even in the midst of thee, O
Jerusalem. Praise the LORD.<BR><BR>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;<BR>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world

come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us
this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we
forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation,
But deliver us from evil.

been graciously pleased to preserve, through the great pain and
peril of child-birth, this woman, thy servant, who desireth now
to offer her praises and thanksgivings unto thee. Grant, we beseech
thee, most merciful Father, that she, through thy help, may faithfully
live according to thy will in this life, and also may be partaker
of everlasting glory in the life to come; through Jesus Christ
our Lord. Amen.</P><H6><CENTER><I>&para; Then may be said,</I></CENTER></H6><P><A NAME=anchor1544536></A>GRANT, we beseech thee, O heavenly
