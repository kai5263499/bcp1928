Matrimony, the Persons to be married shall come into the body
of the Church, or shall be ready in some proper house, with their
friends and neighbours; and there standing together, the Man
on the right hand, and the Woman on the left, the Minister shall
say,</I></H6><P><BR>DEARLY beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of
God, and in the face of this company, to join together this Man
and this Woman in holy Matrimony; which is an honourable estate,
instituted of God, signifying unto us the mystical union that
is betwixt Christ and his Church: which holy estate Christ adorned
and beautified with his presence and first miracle that he wrought
in Cana of Galilee, and is commended of Saint Paul to be honourable
among all men: and therefore is not by any to be entered into
unadvisedly or lightly; but reverently, discreetly, advisedly,
soberly, and in the fear of God. Into this holy estate these
two persons present come now to be joined. If any man can show
just cause, why they may not lawfully be joined together, let
him now speak, or else hereafter for ever hold his peace.</P><H6><I><BR>&para; And also speaking unto the Persons who are to be married,
he shall say,</I></H6><P><BR>I REQUIRE and charge you both, as ye will answer at the dreadful
day of judgment when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed,
that if either of you know any impediment, why ye may not be
lawfully joined together in Matrimony, ye do now confess it.
For be ye well assured, that if any persons are joined together
otherwise than as God's Word doth allow, their marriage is not
lawful.</P><H6><I>&para; The Minister, if he shall have reason to doubt
of the lawfulness of the proposed Marriage, may demand sufficient
surety for his indemnification: but if no impediment shall be
alleged, or suspected, the Minister shall say to the Man,</I></H6><P><BR>N. WILT thou have this Woman to thy wedded wife, to live together
after God's ordinance in the holy estate of Matrimony? Wilt thou
love her, comfort her, honour, and keep her in sickness and in
health; and, forsaking all others, keep thee only unto her, so
long as ye both shall live?</P><H6><CENTER><I>&para; The Man shall answer,</I></CENTER></H6><P><CENTER><BR>I will.</CENTER></P><H6><CENTER><I>&para; Then shall the Minister say unto the Woman,</I></CENTER></H6><P>N. WILT thou have this Man to thy wedded husband, to live
together after God's ordinance in the holy estate of Matrimony?
Wilt thou love him, comfort him, honour, and keep him in sickness
and in health; and, forsaking all others, keep thee only unto
him, so long as ye both shall live?</P><H6><CENTER><I>&para; The Woman shall answer,</I></CENTER></H6><P><CENTER><BR>I will.</CENTER></P><H5><CENTER><I>&para; Then shall the Minister say,</I></CENTER></H5><P><CENTER><BR>Who giveth this Woman to be married to this Man?</CENTER></P><H6><I>&para; Then shall they give their troth to each other
in this manner. The Minister, receiving the Woman at her father's
or friend's hands, shall cause the Man with his right hand to
take the Woman by her right hand, and to say after him as followeth.</I></H6><P><BR>I N. take thee N. to my wedded Wife, to have and to hold from
this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer,
in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death
us do part, according to God's holy ordinance; and thereto I
plight thee my troth.</P><H6><I><BR>&para; Then shall they loose their hands; and the Woman with
her right hand taking the Man by his right hand, shall likewise
say after the Minister,</I></H6><P><BR>I N. take thee N. to my wedded Husband, to have and to hold from
this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer,
in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death
us do part, according to God's holy ordinance; and thereto I
give thee my troth.</P><H6><I><BR>&para; Then shall they again loose their hands; and the Man shall
give unto the Woman a Ring on this wise: the Minister taking
the Ring shall deliver it unto the Man, to put it upon the fourth
finger of the Woman's left hand. And the Man holding the Ring
there, and taught by the Minister, shall say,</I></H6><P><BR>WITH this Ring I thee wed: In the Name of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.</P><H6><I><BR>&para; And, before delivering the Ring to the Man, the Minister
may say as followeth.</I></H6><P><BR>BLESS, O Lord, this Ring, that he who gives it and she who wears
it may abide in thy peace, and continue in thy favour, unto their
life's end; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</P><H6><I>&para; Then, the Man leaving the Ring upon the fourth
finger of the Woman's left hand, the Minister shall say,</I></H6><P><BR>Let us pray.</P><H5><I><BR>&para; Then shall the Minister and the People, still standing,
say the Lord's Prayer.</I></H5><P><BR>OUR Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom
come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us
this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we
forgive, those who trespass against us. And lead us not into
temptation, But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom,
and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.</P><H6><CENTER><A NAME=anchor7837872></A><I>&para; Then shall
the Minister add,</I></CENTER></H6><P>O ETERNAL God, Creator and Preserver of all mankind, Giver
of all spiritual grace, the Author of everlasting life; Send
thy blessing upon these thy servants, this man and this woman,
whom we bless in thy Name; that they, living faithfully together,
may surely perform and keep the vow and covenant betwixt them
made, (whereof this Ring given and received is a token and pledge,)
and may ever remain in perfect love and peace together, and live
according to thy laws; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</P><H6><I>&para; The Minister may add one or both of the following
prayers.</I></H6><P><BR>O ALMIGHTY God, Creator of mankind, who only art the well-spring
of life; Bestow upon these thy servants, if it be thy will, the
gift and heritage of children; and grant that they may see their
children brought up in thy faith and fear, to the honour and
glory of thy Name; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<BR><A NAME=anchor7723433></A><BR>O GOD, who hast so consecrated the state of Matrimony that in
it is represented the spiritual marriage and unity betwixt Christ
and his Church; Look mercifully upon these thy servants, that
they may love, honour, and cherish each other, and so live together
in faithfulness and patience, in wisdom and true godliness, that
their home may be a haven of blessing and of peace; through the
same Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with thee
and the Holy Spirit ever, one God, world without end. Amen.</P><H6><I><BR>&para; Then shall the Minister join their right hands together,
and say,</I></H6><P><BR>Those whom God hath joined together let no man put asunder.</P><H6><I><BR>&para; Then shall the Minister speak unto the company.</I></H6><P><BR>FORASMUCH as N. and N. have consented together in holy wedlock,
and have witnessed the same before God and this company, and
thereto have given and pledged their troth, each to the other,
and have declared the same by giving and receiving a Ring, and
by joining hands; I pronounce that they are Man and Wife, In
the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
Amen.</P><H6><I>&para; The Man and Wife kneeling, the Minister shall add
this Blessing.</I></H6><P><BR>GOD the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost, bless, preserve,
and keep you; the Lord mercifully with his favour look upon you,
and fill you with all spiritual benediction and grace; that ye
may so live together in this life, that in the world to come
ye may have life everlasting. Amen.</P><H6><I>&para; The laws respecting Matrimony, whether by publishing
the Banns in Churches, or by Licence, being different in the
several States, every Minister is left to the direction of those
laws, in every thing that regards the civil contract between
the parties.<BR><BR>&para; And when the Banns are published, it shall be in the following
form: I publish the Banns of Marriage between N. of--, and N.
of--. If any of you know cause, or just impediment, why these
two persons should not be joined together in holy Matrimony,
ye are to declare it. This is the first [second or third] time
of asking.</I></H6><P><CENTER><BR>Go to <A HREF="index.html">1928 Book of Common Prayer</A></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE>
