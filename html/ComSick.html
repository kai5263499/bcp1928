sudden perils, diseases and sicknesses, and ever uncertain what
time they shall depart out of this life; therefore, to the intent
they may be always in readiness to die, whensoever it shall please
Almighty God to call them, the Ministers shall diligently from
time to time, but especially in the time of pestilence, or other
infectious sickness, exhort their parishioners to the often receiving
of the Holy Communion of the Body and Blood of our Saviour Christ,
when it shall be publicly administered in the Church; that so
doing, they may, in case of sudden visitation, have the less
cause to be disquieted for lack of the same. But if the sick
person be not able to come to the Church, and yet is desirous
to receive the Communion in his house; then he must give timely
notice to the Minister, signifying also how many there are to
communicate with him; and all things necessary being prepared,
the Minister shall there celebrate the Holy Communion, beginning
with the Collect, Epistle, and Gospel, here following.</I></H6><P><CENTER><I>The Collect.</I></CENTER><P>ALMIGHTY, everliving God, Maker of mankind, who dost correct
those whom thou dost love, and chastise every one whom thou dost
receive; We beseech thee to have mercy upon this thy servant
visited with thine hand, and to grant that he may take his sickness
patiently, and recover his bodily health, if it be thy gracious
will; and that, whensoever his soul shall depart from the body,
it may be without spot presented unto thee; through Jesus Christ
our Lord. Amen.<BR><P><CENTER><I>The Epistle.</I> Hebrews xii. 5.</CENTER><P>MY son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint
when thou art rebuked of him: for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth,
and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.<BR><P><CENTER><I>The Gospel. </I>St. John v. 24.</CENTER><P>VERILY, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and
believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall
not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.</P><H6><CENTER><I>&para; Or the following Collect, Epistle, and
Gospel.</I></CENTER></H6><P><CENTER><I>The Collect.</I></CENTER><P>O LORD, holy Father, by whose loving-kindness our souls and
bodies are renewed; Mercifully look upon this thy servant, that,
every cause of sickness being removed, he may be restored to
soundness of health; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<BR><P><CENTER><I>The Epistle. </I>1 St. John v. 13.</CENTER><P>THESE things have I written unto you that believe on the name
of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life,
and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. And this
is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing
according to his will, he heareth us: and if we know that he
hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions
that we desired of him.<BR><P><CENTER>The Gospel. St. John vi. 47.</CENTER><P>JESUS said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth
on me hath everlasting life. I am that bread of life. Your fathers
did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This is the bread
which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and
not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if
any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread
that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life
of the world.</P><H6><I>&para; After which the Minister shall proceed according
to the form before prescribed for the Holy Communion, beginning
at these words, </I>Ye who do truly, etc.<BR><I>&para; At the time of the distribution of the holy Sacrament,
the Minister shall first receive the Communion himself, and after
minister unto those who are appointed to communicate with the
sick, and last of all to the sick person.<BR>&para; When circumstances render it expedient to shorten the
Service, the following form shall suffice: The Confession and
the Absolution; Lift up your hearts, etc., through the Sanctus;
The Prayer of Consecration, ending with these words, partakers
of his most blessed Body and Blood; The Prayer of Humble Access;
The Communion; The Lord's Prayer; The Blessing. And NOTE, That
for the Confession and Absolution the following may be used.</I></H6><P><CENTER><I>The Confession.</I></CENTER><P>O ALMIGHTY Father, Lord of heaven and earth, we confess that
we have sinned against thee in thought, word, and deed. Have
mercy upon us, O God, after thy great goodness; according to
the multitude of thy mercies, do away our offences and cleanse
us from our sins; for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.<BR><P><CENTER><I>The Absolution.</I></CENTER><P>THE Almighty and merciful Lord grant you Absolution and Remission
of all your sins, true repentance, amendment of life, and the
grace and consolation of his Holy Spirit. Amen.</P><H6><I>&para; But if a man, either by reason of extremity of
sickness, or for want of warning in due time to the Minister,
or by any other just impediment, do not receive the Sacrament
of Christ's Body and Blood, the Minister shall instruct him,
that if he do truly repent him of his sins, and stedfastly believe
that Jesus Christ hath suffered death upon the Cross for him,
and shed his Blood for his redemption, earnestly remembering
the benefits he hath thereby, and giving him hearty thanks therefor,
he doth eat and drink the Body and Blood of our Saviour Christ
profitably to his soul's health, although he do not receive the
Sacrament with his mouth.<BR><BR>&para; This Office may be used with aged and bed-ridden persons,
or such as are not able to attend the public Ministration in
Church, substituting the Collect, Epistle, and Gospel for the
Day, for those appointed above.</I></H6><P><CENTER><BR>Go to <A HREF="index.html">1928 Book of Common Prayer</A></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT=154><H6><CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR><BR>Copyright 1996-2000. <A HREF="http://www.episcopalnet.org/index.html">episcopalnet.org</A><BR><BR></CENTER></H6></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></H2>
