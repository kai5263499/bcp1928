And let these also first beproved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being foundblameless. Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers,sober, faithful in all things. Let the deacons be the husbandsof one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase tothemselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith whichis in Christ Jesus.</P><H6><CENTER><I>&para; Or else.</I></CENTER></H6><P><CENTER><BR><I>The Epistle.</I> Acts vi. 2.</CENTER><P>THEN the twelve called the multitude of the disciples untothem, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the wordof God, and serve tables. Wherefore, brethren, look ye out amongyou seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom,whom we may appoint over this business. But we will give ourselvescontinually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word. And thesaying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, aman full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus,and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyteof Antioch: whom they set before the apostles: and when they hadprayed, they laid their hands on them. And the word of God increased;and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly;and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.</P><H6><I>&para; Then, the People being sealed, the Bishop shallexamine every one of those who are to be Ordered, in the presenceof the People, after this manner following</I></H6><P><BR>DO you trust that you are inwardly moved by the Holy Ghost totake upon you this Office and Ministration, to serve God for thepromoting of his glory, and the edifying of his people?<BR><B>Answer. </B>I trust so.<BR><BR><B>Bishop. </B>Do you think that you are truly called, accordingto the will of our Lord Jesus Christ, and according to the Canonsof this Church, to the Ministry of the same?<BR><B>Answer.</B> I think so.<BR><BR><B>Bishop. </B>Are you persuaded that the Holy Scriptures containall Doctrine required as necessary for eternal salvation throughfaith in Jesus Christ?<BR><B>Answer.</B> I am so persuaded.<BR><BR><B>Bishop.</B> Will you diligently read the same unto the peopleassembled in the Church where you shall be appointed to serve?<BR><B>Answer.</B> I will.<BR><BR><B>Bishop. </B>It appertaineth to the Office of a Deacon, in theChurch where he shall be appointed to serve, to assist the Priestin Divine Service, and specially when he ministereth the HolyCommunion, and to help him in the distribution thereof; and toread Holy Scriptures and Homilies in the Church; and to instructthe youth in the Catechism; in the absence of the Priest to baptizeinfants; and to preach, if he be admitted thereto by the Bishop.And furthermore, it is his Office, where provision is so made,to search for the sick, poor, and impotent people of the Parish,that they may be relieved with the alms of the Parishioners, orothers. Will you do this gladly and willingly?<BR><B>Answer.</B> I will so do, by the help of God.<BR><BR><B>Bishop.</B> Will you apply all your diligence to frame andfashion your own lives, and the lives of your families, accordingto the Doctrine of Christ; and to make both you selves and them,as much as in you lieth, wholesome examples of the flock of Christ?<BR><B>Answer. </B>I will so do, the Lord being my helper.<BR><BR><B>Bishop. </B>Will you reverently obey your Bishop, and otherchief Ministers, who, according to the Canons of the Church, mayhave the charge and government over you; following with a gladmind and will their godly admonitions?<BR><B>Answer. </B>I will endeavour so to do, the Lord being my helper.</P><H6><I><BR>&para; Then, the People standing, the Bishop shall lay his Handsseverally upon the Head of every one to be made Deacon, humblykneeling before him, and shall say,</I></H6><P><BR>TAKE thou Authority to execute the Office of a Deacon in the Churchof God committed unto thee; In the Name of the Father, and ofthe Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.</P><H6><I><BR>&para; Then shall the Bishop deliver to every one of them theNew Testament, saying,</I></H6><P><BR>TAKE thou Authority to read the Gospel in the Church of God, andto preach the same, if thou be thereto licensed by the Bishophimself.</P><H6><CENTER><I><BR>&para; Then one of them, appointed by the Bishop, shall read theGospel.</I></CENTER></H6><P><CENTER><I>The Gospel. </I>St. Luke xii. 35.</CENTER><P>LET your loins be girded about, and your lights burning; andye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when hewill return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh,they may open unto him immediately. Blessed are those servants,whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I sayunto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit downto meat, and will come forth and serve them. And if he shall comein the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find themso, blessed are those servants.</P><H6><I>&para; Then shall the Bishop proceed in the Communion;and all who are Ordered shall tarry, and receive the Holy Communionthe same day, with the Bishop.<BR><BR>&para; The Communion ended, after the last Collect, and immediatelybefore the Benediction, shall be said this Collect following.</I></H6><P><BR>ALMIGHTY God, giver of all good things, who of thy great goodnesshast vouchsafed to accept and take these thy servants unto theOffice of Deacons in thy Church; Make them, we beseech thee, OLord, to be modest, humble, and constant in their Ministration,to have a ready will to observe all spiritual Discipline; thatthey, having always the testimony of a good conscience, and continuingever stable and strong in thy Son Christ, may so well behave themselvesin this inferior Office, that they may be found worthy to be calledunto the higher Ministries in thy Church; through the same thySon our Saviour Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and honour, worldwithout end.<I> Amen.</I><BR><BR>THE Peace of God, which passeth all understanding. keep your heartsand minds in the knowledge and love of God, and of his Son JesusChrist our Lord: And the Blessing of God Almighty, the Father,the Son, and the Holy Ghost, be amongst you, and remain with youalways.<I> Amen.</I></P><H6><I>&para; And here it must be declared unto the Deacon, thathe must continue in that Office of a Deacon the space of a wholeyear, (except for reasonable causes it shall otherwise seem goodunto the Bishop,) to the intent he may be perfect and well expertin the things appertaining to the Ecclesiastical Administration.In executing whereof if he be found faithful and diligent, hemay be admitted by his Diocesan to the Order of Priesthood, atthe times appointed in the Canon; or else, on urgent occasion,upon some other day, in the face of the Church, in such mannerand form as hereafter followeth.</I></H6><P><CENTER>Go to <A HREF="index.html">1928 Book of Common Prayer</A></CENTER>
